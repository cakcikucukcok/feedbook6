  <title>8 Days on the Delaware River: - Paul M. Donovan Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="8 days on the Delaware River: A Trip To Remember, is about a fishing and camping adventure complete by Author Paul Donovan and his fishing buddy Ray Labarre.  The trip was talked about for about 18 years and finally occurred in May 2006.  The 120 mile trip started in Hancock, NY and was to end at Kittatinny Beach in Delaware Water Gap, PA   Rays 14 foot aluminum boat had taken us up and down the Delaware River many times over those 18 years, but generally in the National Park area in and above the Delaware Water Gap.  This time, fully loaded for a week in the outdoors, we were venturing North in waters that are better suited for canoes.  The eight-day adventure covered low rocky water situations as well as some rather fast scary rapids as we enjoyed fantastic sights along the scenic Upper and Middle Delaware Rivers areas.  There was an emergency room visit, shopping for a new oar, naturally a few fishing stories and a truly unexpected &#39;boat ride&#39; that kept us moving along.  With some stories from past trips and the experiences of this trip all relayed day by day, chapter by chapter, you will enjoy. . . . . . .
