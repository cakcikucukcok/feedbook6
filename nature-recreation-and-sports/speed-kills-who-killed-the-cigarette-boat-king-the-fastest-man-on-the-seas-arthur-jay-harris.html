  <title>Speed Kills: Who killed the Cigarette Boat King, the fastest man on the seas? - Arthur Jay Harris</title>

Police found they didn&amp;rsquo;t just have a murder mystery&amp;mdash;they had Murder on the Orient Express.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FEBRUARY 3, 1987&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;USA Racing Team, Miami, Florida&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Someone entered the front door and walked in front of salesman Jerry Engelman&amp;rsquo;s desk. He asked to speak with Don Aronow, then looked right at him without recognizing him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What do you want?&amp;rdquo; Aronow said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to get ahold of you,&amp;rdquo; the man said. He said he worked for a very rich man, with an Italian surname, who wanted to make an appointment to buy a boat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I never heard of him,&amp;rdquo; Aronow answered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Engelman could tell something else was happening, and he thought Aronow was trying to find out what.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then the conversation got weird. He was proud of his boss, he said. &amp;ldquo;He picked me up off the street when I was sixteen and took care of me. I&amp;rsquo;d even kill for my boss.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For the moment, none of the observers thought anything more of it. Minutes later, Aronow drove his new 1987 white Mercedes 560 sports coupe across the street, found Mike Britton, a marine supplier, and asked if he could help him at his new house.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Driving out of his parking space forward, with Aronow behind him, Britton saw a dark Lincoln Town Car with tinted windows, about ten yards away, facing east as Britton was about to head west. The driver&amp;rsquo;s window was down, and Britton could see the driver looking at him.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At their closest, when they passed, they were just a few feet apart, keeping eye contact the entire time. Then Britton drove on, about fifty yards.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then he heard gunshots.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Britton finished parking his truck, then raced back toward Aronow. In a hurry, the Lincoln passed him, going west. It had turned around.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By the time Britton got to the car, he found Aronow&amp;rsquo;s driver&amp;rsquo;s window down, the transmission in neutral, and Aronow&amp;rsquo;s foot pressed against the accelerator like a rock, forcing the engine to rev at its most shrill. Apparently, Aronow had stopped to kibitz with his killer.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arthurjayharris.com&quot;&gt;www.arthurjayharris.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;" />
