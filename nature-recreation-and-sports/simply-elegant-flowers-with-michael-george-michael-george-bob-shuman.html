  <title>Simply Elegant Flowers With Michael George - Michael George, Bob Shuman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="New York&#39;s premier fashion industry florist, Michael George is known for his signature graphic, modern arrangements that are as popular in Manhattan hotels and storefronts as they are on the pages of &lt;i&gt;Vogue&lt;/i&gt; and on the set of &lt;i&gt;Good Morning America&lt;/i&gt;. In &lt;i&gt;Simply Elegant Flowers&lt;/i&gt;, George shares his secrets for creating these beautiful arrangements as he guides you, season by season, through a year of flowers.&lt;p&gt;George&#39;s philosophy of living and creating with flowers is contagious, and soon you&#39;ll agree that fresh, seasonal arrangements can enhance your life every day, not just on special occasions. His compositions recreate flowers as they are in nature&amp;#151which, as he reminds us, is already perfect. Typically overlooked blooms, like carnations, take on a stunning new character when arranged en masse in a perfect dome, while more exotic stems, like dendrobium orchids, are at their most elegant when allowed to stand alone in a simple vase.&lt;p&gt;Easy to follow, step-by-step instructions and photographs show you how to master George&#39;s techniques for building clean, contemporary floral compositions with his trademark architectural precision. Along the way, George shares helpful insights from a lifetime of working with flowers, and his recommendations of choice blooms for every season give you the confidence you need to begin creating your own unique arrangements, regardless of your budget. Beautiful photography brings the flowers to life on every page as he shows you how simple it is to apply these basic techniques to virtually any bloom. With &lt;i&gt;Simply Elegant Flowers&lt;/i&gt; as your guide, you&#39;ll be arranging flowers like a professional&amp;#151and displaying them like a celebrity." />
