  <title>Impounded Water Bodies Modelling and Simulation - Salisu Dan’azumi, Supiah Shamsudin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book enhances knowledge on Impounded Water Bodies (IWB) systems of the interested parties. They include academicians, scholars, scientist, researchers, engineers, undergraduate and postgraduate students. Specifically this book is valuable for everyone involved in water, hydrology, environment, civil engineering and other related disciplines.  This book emphasized modelling and simulation of IWB particularly; Reservoir and Detention Pond, in relation to the two major hydrological problems; Flood and Water Pollution. The knowledge presented is useful for hydrological systems real phenomenon replication and prediction. This book also provides IWB general overview, in terms of the preliminary and state of the art analysis which may trigger the interest for further research and investigations. The IWB related factors were integrated to provide the quantitative framework, alternative approaches and valuable outcomes that lead to worthy policy establishment. This book covers topic related to nutrient (phosphorus) loadings estimation using the new version of Event-Based Stochastic Model in reservoir systems. The detention pond systems modelling using Analytical Probabilistic Models (APM) and the optimization of detention time using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) are elaborated. It is hoped that the book provides useful knowledge in pursuit of the IWB sustainable development. 
Dr Supiah Shamsudin is an Associate Professor in Water Resources and Hydrology  at the Razak School of Engineering and Advanced Technology, Universiti Teknologi Malaysia - Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. She obtained Bachelor of Science (Civil Engineering) from University of Miami, USA and Master of Science (Hydrology and Water resources) from University of Nebraska - Lincoln, USA. She later obtained Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Civil Engineering from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia in 2003. Her main specialization is Impounded Water Bodies Engineering and Management. Her research interest include intelligent detention pond design, watershed and reservoir management under uncertain environment,  environmental hydrology, reservoir eutrophication, fuzzy and risk related approaches and multicriteria decision support  for water resources systems. She had extensive involvements in international peer reviewed indexed journal publications and presented at many national and international conferences. 
Dr Salisu Danazumi is currently a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Civil Engineering, Bayero University Kano - Nigeria. He holds a Bachelors degree (Civil Engineering) and Masters degree (Water Resources and Environmental Engineering) from Bayero University Kano - Nigeria in 1998 and 2006 respectively.  He obtained a PhD degree in Hydrology from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia in 2012. His research interest include: multi-objective optimization of water resource systems using particle swarm optimization, risk and uncertainty analysis and surface water quality modelling. He has authored and co-authored many papers in international peer reviewed journals and conferences." />
