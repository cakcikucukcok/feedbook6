BRUCE SCOOP COOPER, HOCKEY HISTORIAN, AUTHOR, AND BROADCASTER&lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;It was March 1965 when Clarence Campbell, president of the National Hockey League, emerged from a long board meeting and announced that the NHL would double in size beginning with the 1967-68 season. Fans loyal to the Original Six were furious. Owners were irate. In &lt;i&gt;The Great Expansion: The Ultimate Risk that Changed the NHL Forever&lt;/i&gt;, hockey expert Alan Bass profiles the power brokers and provides an in-depth study of the decision and its revolutionary impact on the game. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Bass, a former hockey player and freelance sports writer, relies on thorough research, interviews, and first-person accounts in order to reach into the past and uncover the mystery of a behind-closed-doors decision that seemed improbable at the time. As he profiles the powerful owners, media moguls, and die-hard sportsmen involved in the politics and backroom dealings, Bass shares a never-before-seen glimpse into how the decision forever impacted professional hockey in North America. &lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Great Expansion: The Ultimate Risk that Changed the NHL Forever&lt;/i&gt; is not only an important documentation of Clarence Campbells bold move of doubling the number of NHL franchises, but also provides an unforgettable look back into the history of pro hockey in North America.&lt;/p&gt;" />
