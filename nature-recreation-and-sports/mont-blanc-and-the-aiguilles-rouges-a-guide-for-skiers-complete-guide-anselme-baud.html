  <title>Mont Blanc and the Aiguilles Rouges - a Guide for Skiers: Complete Guide - Anselme Baud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;All the skiing downhills of the Aiguilles Rouges and Mont Blanc mountains are gathered in this unique book, written by one of the most talented skiers of his generation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Located at the very heart of the highest mountains of Europe, the majestic Mont Blanc massif stands as a reference among the most sacred skiing places in the world. When winter comes, this snow-addict heaven offers a unique range of dream slopes, from the easiest to the most breathtakingly high ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anselme Baud is an extreme skiing leading head and one of the best experts of this mountain. He gives us here the first comprehensive rundown of the Mont Blanc and Aiguilles Rouges skiing downhills. From classic skiing hikes to mountaineering competitions, this guide book presents a precise description of all the biggest slopes this mythic area could offer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks to his charming accounts and instructive advice, Anselme Baud shares with us his precious and wide experience as a high mountain guide and an exceptional skier.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;PRESS REVIEW&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- « In its own genre, this is a bible  » &lt;b&gt;- Alpinisme &amp;amp; Randonnée&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- « More than a rundown guide, the latest Anselme Baud’s work is a real nice book, easy-reading, full of information and suggestions » &lt;b&gt;- Vertical&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- « Did Anselme Baud just write the skiing Bible of the Mont Blanc and Aiguilles Rouges mountains ?  » &lt;b&gt;- Montagnes Magazine&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- « This is the skiing rundown that missed on our bookshelves » &lt;b&gt;- Bulletin des guides&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;- « A gold nugget.

As a high mountain guide in 1973, he was one the first to ski on extreme downhills in the Alps, the Andes, in Antarctica or in the Himalayas. As an ENSA professor, he supervised during several years the mountain guides trainings in Bolivia and Nepal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the amateur looking for the most beautiful powder snow to the mountaineer who is keen on extreme skiing, ski fans will find in this book all the useful information to fulfill their dreams of perfect lines and immaculate marks!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXCERPT &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;INTRODUCTION  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;MONT BLANC&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unique and majestic, basking in glorious light or vexed by troublesome storms, Mont Blanc is the king of Europe. It presides in stately fashion over its glaciers, deep valleys, and delicately crenellated granite ridges. Its summit has always been prized ; its deadly rages terrifying some and fascinating others.&lt;br&gt;The first to tread on its snowy dome were the Chamoniards Gabriel Paccard and Jacques Balmat on 8th August 1786. Since that time the mountain has enjoyed no respite : first came the caravans of hopeful conquerors, then there were the intrepid unguided parties, those in eager pursuit of discovery, and adventurers of all kinds. Latterly, with the aid of advances in technology, we have witnessed, or indeed participated in, some more irreverent assaults on the mountain’s dignity : Jansen’s laboratory (financed by Eiffel), a banquet sponsored by a leading brand of champagne, a car on the summit that subsequently remained stranded in a snowdrift on the Petits Mulets Ridge (4690m) for several months, to name but a few..." />
