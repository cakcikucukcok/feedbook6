  <title>Sir Donald Bradman Memorabilia - James Merchant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sir Donald has always encapsulated a lot of what inspires me. He was a remarkable sportsman and an Australian Legend, who handled his fame with class. His cricket prowess and longevity of life meant that a lot of memorabilia was produced since around 1930 and there is always a market for it. As a person inflicted with the collecting bug and a strong sense of National pride, I couldnt help myself! 
There are many collectors and museums in the cricketing world, but there is very little reference material relating to their treasures. I have always kept the sales advertisements, brochures, certificates and boxes pertaining to the items in my collection, because they give it more meaning. An item of memorabilia can give you visual stimulus and even prompt some feelings relating to its procurement or your journey to see it. However, Ive learnt that a little bit of knowledge can also transcend an item of memorabilia from an object to something more of a friend or family member.
For the statistically minded, there are 209 A4 pages, featuring 141 different items, 214 colour images, 381 references and 89 different cricketers are mentioned in connection with the items." />
