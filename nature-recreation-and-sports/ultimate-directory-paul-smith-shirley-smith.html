  <title>Ultimate Directory - Paul Smith, Shirley Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Titled the ‘Ultimate Directory’ is no understatement in describing this book!  Several years were spent tracing the exact location of every ground - over 320 in total - that has ever staged a Football League match in Scotland or England.  From Abbey Park (Grimsby Town) to York Street (Boston United), Almondvale Stadium (Livingston) to Whitestone Park (Peebles Rovers) they are all here, via the famous Anfield (Liverpool) and Hampden Park (Queens Park) plus the obscure such as The Vicarage in Whitwick (Loughborough) and Clune Park (Port Glasgow Athletic), none have been omitted.  Aided by information from many clubs’ historians and supporters, libraries and other works the ‘Ultimate Directory of English and Scottish Football Grounds’ includes the precise location of every venue, together with a ground map, a potted history and the statistical details of every League club that has played at each.  These records include the first and last games staged at the venues, the highest and lowest attendances recorded there, the biggest victory and the worst defeat. In addition to the plans there are many photos of the grounds themselves.  Two comprehensive alphabetic indexes give the locations in the book of the clubs and the grounds themselves.  Not only a useful and interesting readable reference book, and a ‘coffee table’ book, it is an invaluable aid for those wishing to visit the grounds themselves or the sites of the former ones." />
