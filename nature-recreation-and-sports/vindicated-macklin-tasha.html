  <title>Vindicated - Macklin Tasha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In every sense of the word, Santiago Acevedo is a boss. Men respect and fear him, and women worship and desire him. But not all is well within the Acevedo family. Santiago learns of his wife Melanie&#39;s affair from his second in command, Basim. Murder then becomes his motive, and every move he makes thereafter proves detrimental to his precious daughter Eva, his troubled son Tariq, and his money-making empire. Once his enemy finds a crack in his armor, Santiago&#39;s weaknesses are exploited and strings are pulled that ultimately lead to destruction. Santiago has always been the master of his own destiny, but now it seems that destiny is mastering him. Will Santiago discover the truth and become fully vindicated before time runs out, or will he fall victim to the perfectly executed setup?" />
