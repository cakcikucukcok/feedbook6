  <title>Donkeys. Donkeys as pets. Donkey Keeping, Care, Pros and Cons, Housing, Diet and Health. - Roger Rodendale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Donkeys were amongst the first animals to be domesticated and have been around humans for a very long time. So, it is quite natural for them to be able to live amongst humans peacefully and even become great companions over time.&lt;br /&gt; Donkeys are extremely emotional and sensitive. They are great around kids as long as you are able to tell your children how to interact with the animal correctly. They make great companions, especially if you have a stable with a lonely horse. Yes, horses and donkeys make great companions.&lt;br /&gt; When you decide to bring a donkey home as a pet, there are several things that you need to consider, the main thing being the availability of space for your new pet. They are not animals that can be kept in small areas. They need a dedicated space that can be used when you want them to rest or just stay in. They also need constant care for a healthy life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; That is why this book brings to you a lot of practical knowledge. The book contains everything that you need to know from the types of donkeys that you can bring home, introducing a donkey into your household, training them, feeding them, housing them and also ensuring that they are always in good health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Covered in this book:&lt;br /&gt; Care&lt;br /&gt; Costs&lt;br /&gt; Daily care&lt;br /&gt; Do&amp;rsquo;s and don&amp;rsquo;ts&lt;br /&gt; Feeding&lt;br /&gt; Health&lt;br /&gt; History&lt;br /&gt; Intelligence&lt;br /&gt; One or two&lt;br /&gt; Personality&lt;br /&gt; Tips on buying&lt;br /&gt; Training&lt;br /&gt; Travelling&lt;br /&gt; &amp;hellip;and much more&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
