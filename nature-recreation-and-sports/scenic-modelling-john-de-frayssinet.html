  <title>Scenic Modelling - John de Frayssinet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This invaluable and well-illustrated book describes landscape modelling from a new perspective. It explains in detail how to design and construct a model railway in a convincing and pleasing landscape. The author has always considered that model railway dioramas are an art form and this book is brimming with advice and tips that will allow the modeller to create true-to-life landscapes. Important aspects of all stages of construction are covered, including the building of satisfactory baseboards, topography and ground cover, modelling lakes and waterfalls, and making realistic trees. The author argues that a good model railway is one that is placed in an accurate and realistic landscape which, after all, was there first, and he contends that scenic modelling is not just a means to fill up the gaps in between track work; rather it is essential in creating the perfect backdrop, enabling model locomotives and rolling stock to be displayed convincingly. A remarkable book and describes landscape modelling from a new perspective. Essential reading for all serious railway modellers. Brimming with advice and tips that allows the modeller to create true-to-life landscapes. Superbly illustrated with 230 colour photographs. John de Frayssinet is a professional railway modeller and has written extensively for model railway magazines." />
