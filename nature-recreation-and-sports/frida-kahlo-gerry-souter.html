  <title>Frida Kahlo - Gerry Souter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hidden behind the portraits of Frida Kahlo is the remarkable story of the artist’s life. It is precisely this combination that attracts the spectator. Frida’s work is a testimony of her life; it is not often that one can understand an artist simply by looking within the frame of their paintings. Frida Kahlo is without any doubt Mexico’s gift to art history. She was just eighteen when a terrible accident changed her life forever, leaving her disabled and in constant pain. But her explosive temper, her unwavering determination and her eagerness gave her the strength to develop her artistic talent.
Always at her side was the great Mexican painter and muralist Diego Rivera. His compulsive womanizing did not prevent Frida from captivating him with her charms, her talent and her intelligence. She quickly learnt to make the most of Diego’s success to discover the world, creating her own legacy along the way and being surrounded by a very close group of attentive friends. Her personal life was stormy: several times she left Diego in order to have relationships with people of both sexes. Nonetheless, Frida and Diego were able to save their deteriorating romance. The history and the paintings that Frida left us reveal the story of a brave woman in constant search of her identity." />
