  <title>Dark Secrets of Poker - Lamont Lloyd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hi, Lamont Lloyd is here, and I&#39;m going to keep it short and sweet!  Are you tired of constant bad beats?  Are you curious why bad players, constantly win with awful hands?  Have you ever felt worried whenever you see yourself holding Pocket Aces because you&#39;ve lost so many times.  Have you ever been on a good winning streak, only to watch your losses start to double?  Are you tired of grinding at the poker tables only to make pennies a night?  Would you like a consistent winning poker strategy that doesnt require you to read 500 pages of filler before the author gets to the point?  Well, I reveal what the other pros won&#39;t reveal about online poker; something deeper than having a good poker strategy in itself. You need to know something that I and many other players have discovered. Yet, most are still in denial.  Just like this sales page, my book is short but sweet - &quot;To be wise, is to be simple&quot;. So, I will only be teaching you strategies to get you winning and winning tonight! No filler!" />
