  <title>The Chicago Tribune Book of the Chicago Bulls: A Decade-by-Decade History - Chicago Tribune Staff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;The Chicago Bulls, one of the NBA&#39;s most storied and valuable franchises, have been building their highly decorated legacy for five decades now. To this day, the Bulls are one of the most popular teams the world over. Travelers abroad will find that the team&#39;s reputation precedes them: Chicagoans who were once greeted by sneers about Al Capone now hear cheers for Bulls legend Michael Jordan. Six championships, the league&#39;s best-ever single-season record, and perhaps the greatest player of all time will do that, and Bulls fans wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Published to commemorate the team&#39;s 50th anniversary, &lt;I&gt;The Chicago Tribune Book of the Chicago Bulls&lt;/I&gt; is a decade-by-decade look at the pride of Chicago&#39;s West Side. This beautiful coffee-table volume documents every era in the team&#39;s history through original reporting, in-depth analysis, interviews, archival photos, comprehensive timelines, rankings of top players by position, and other features. Profiles on key coaches, Hall of Famers, and MVPs provide an entertaining, blow-by-blow look at the team&#39;s greatest successes and most dramatic moments.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From the beginning, the Bulls have set records. They are still the only NBA expansion team to make the playoffs in their inaugural season, which they did in 1966&amp;#150;67 with the best record ever for a first-year team. Led by Chicago legend Johnny &quot;Red&quot; Kerr, these athletes set the foundation for the team&#39;s winning culture. The 70s saw the Bulls trot out a host of talented and hard-nosed players, such as Bob Love, Chet Walker, Norm Van Lier, Jerry Sloan, and Artis Gilmore, winning popularity among the city&#39;s blue-collared fans.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Bulls soared to new heights after drafting Michael Jordan third overall in the 1984 draft. Once joined by fellow Hall of Famers Scottie Pippen and coach Phil Jackson, Jordan and the Bulls overcame their arch-nemesis in the &quot;Bad Boy&quot; Detroit Pistons and won two sets of three consecutive championships in the 90s. The new millennium saw repeated attempts to reignite the magic of the Jordan-era Bulls, but soon a new identity emerged of tough, hardworking team players reminiscent of the Bulls&#39; earlier years. Since the start of their fifth decade, the Bulls have consistently been one of the top teams in the league and are hungry to hang another championship banner from the rafters of 1901 West Madison Street.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A first-of-its-kind collectors item, &lt;I&gt;The Chicago Tribune Book of the Chicago Bulls&lt;/I&gt; is a gorgeous and comprehensive tour through basketball history produced by the award-winning &lt;I&gt;Chicago Tribune&lt;/I&gt; journalists who have been documenting their home team since the beginning.&lt;/div&gt;" />
