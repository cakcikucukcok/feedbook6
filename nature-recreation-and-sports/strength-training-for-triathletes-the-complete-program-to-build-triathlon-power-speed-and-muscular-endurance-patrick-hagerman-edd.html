  <title>Strength Training for Triathletes: The Complete Program to Build Triathlon Power, Speed, and Muscular Endurance - Patrick Hagerman, EdD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Strength Training for Triathletes&lt;/i&gt; offers a comprehensive strength training program for triathlon that will help triathletes build power, speed, and muscular endurance for faster racing over any race distance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certified USA Triathlon coach and NSCA Personal Trainer of the Year Patrick Hagerman, EdD, reveals a focused, triathlon-specific strength training program that will enable triathletes to push harder during training and on the racecourse when the effort is hardest. Triathletes who master this progressive strength training program will also become more resistant to injury, meaning fewer missed workouts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Strength Training for Triathletes&lt;/i&gt;  features 75 of the most effective strength training exercises for triathlon swimming, cycling, and running plus core strength and general conditioning. Full-color photographs illustrate each simple exercise, and exercises are grouped so athletes can focus on their own individual performance limiters. Hagerman simplifies the science underlying strength training, offering easy-to-follow guidelines on resistance and reps that will make triathletes stronger through every phase of the season. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Strength Training for Triathletes&lt;/i&gt; develops these abilities in triathletes:&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;More powerful, longer-lasting muscles&lt;li&gt;Resistance to fatigue and injury&lt;li&gt;Improved body composition with stronger, leaner muscle mass&lt;li&gt;Better performance without added bulk&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New in this second edition are sample strength training programs for the most popular triathlon race distances and for each of triathlon&#39;s three sports, full-color photographs showing detailed body positions for each exercise, several new exercises, new indexes that specify body-weight exercises and weighted exercises, an exercise log template to track your goal weights, and a new index to improve usability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strength training often separates the top performers in triathlon from the middle of the pack. Even small improvements in muscle strength can add up to big race results.  &lt;i&gt;Strength Training for Triathletes&lt;/i&gt; makes it simple for triathletes of all levels to get stronger and race faster. &lt;/p&gt;" />
