  <title>Racing Fuel for the Spirit - Roy Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Motorcycling has become more than a fad in America. It is now a pastime for a growing number of people. Entire families are riding dirt bikes and ATVs for recreation. Motocross racing is the fastest growing motor sport behind NASCAR and has captured the imagination of an entire generation of fans who enjoy the excitement of extreme sports.
Roy Jenkins started riding motorcycles in the early 70s and was a successful amateur racer by the time he graduated from High School. Today he is a motocross racing announcer, chaplain, teacher and journalist. Racing Fuel for the Spirit is his second book written for motorcycle riders who want inspiration and spiritual growth from the Bible. Using his 20 years of Bible teaching experience and Masters degree in Biblical Studies, this ordained minister leads weekly devotions at motocross and Arenacross races in Mississippi and Louisiana. He uses stories from his years as a Pastor, River deck hand, Oil-field commercial diver, school teacher and most importantly as a husband and father. He throws in some stories from his experiences from motocross racing, cross-country motorcycle trips, and even sailing adventures. Photos from the people, places and events are sprinkled liberally throughout the book.
His calling, gift and purpose is to get the Bible into the hands of people who wont normally read it for themselves. He uses a real life story, raises an interesting question, then brings in the appropriate Bible principle, sometimes finishing off with a memorable quote for the day. In this book he includes photos from the world of motorcycling and beyond to help the reader picture the inspirational thought.
Racing Fuel for the Spirit is especially helpful for those who are too busy to read, but are interested in hearing how Gods Word applies to a wide range of everyday topics such as: love, family, worry, prayer, patience, health, competing, depression, work, school, getting old, enjoying life, hope," />
