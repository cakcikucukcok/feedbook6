  <title>Miniature Donkey. Miniature Donkey Owners Manual. Miniature Donkey care, environment, health, feeding and breeding. - Harry Holdstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Miniature Mediterranean Donkey, also known as the Miniature Donkey or simply the mini, hails originally from the Italian islands of Sardinia and Sicily. They are not just very small donkeys but an entirely separate species. They are the smallest of the equines and increasingly popular as pets.&lt;br /&gt;
This book will introduce you to these little donkeys by discussing their appearance and biology, typical behaviour, reproduction, their feeding needs, socialisation and bonding, how to train them and what makes these adorable equines such wonderful pets.&lt;br /&gt;
It will also tell you what you need to know in order to decide whether or not this is the pet for you &amp;ndash; cuteness factor aside &amp;ndash; and, if it is, where to buy one, how to select your mini, what you need to arrange and buy before you bring it home, and how to take proper care of it.&lt;br /&gt;
The owner must know what these pint-sized, intelligent and very loving equines need with regards to their environment, feeding and social and mental lives in order to be both healthy and happy.&lt;br /&gt;
The Miniature Mediterranean Donkey is susceptible to several of the same bacterial, parasitic and viral infections that standard donkeys and horses may contract. Anyone who is serious about owning one needs to know how to care for them, what to look for and how to deal with common conditions.&lt;br /&gt;
