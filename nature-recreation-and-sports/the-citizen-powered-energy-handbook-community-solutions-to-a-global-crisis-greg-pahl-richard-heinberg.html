  <title>The Citizen-Powered Energy Handbook: Community Solutions to a Global Crisis - Greg Pahl, Richard Heinberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, Al Gore&#39;s summer blockbuster &lt;em&gt;An Inconvenient Truth&lt;/em&gt;, and crude oil prices soaring to all-time highs, more people than ever know the truth about our oil addiction. Global warming is here. M. King Hubbert&#39;s oil peak is fast approaching (or may already have arrived). The secret&#39;s out: fossil fuel reserves are dwindling and popular interest has created the need for accessible, realistic solutions.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Citizen-Powered Energy Handbook&lt;/em&gt;, a clear-eyed view of the critical situation we face, offers ways out. Greg Pahl examines energy technologies currently available and homes in on renewable energy strategies that can be adopted by individuals and communities. Such cooperative initiatives have been common in Europe for years and are beginning to gain a foothold in the US. Each chapter focuses on a different renewable energy category--solar, wind, water, biomass, liquid biofuels, and geothermal--then reviews their advantages and disadvantages and desccribes numerous examples of successful, proven local initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Citizen-Powered Energy Handbook&lt;/em&gt; is an eloquent appeal for community and regional action to initiate an array of solutions to energy needs until now controlled by large, distant utilities and consortiums. It is time to take back control of the energy and environmental challenges ahead; this book will help people do just that. It is a handbook for anyone ready to take the first steps towards a more sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
