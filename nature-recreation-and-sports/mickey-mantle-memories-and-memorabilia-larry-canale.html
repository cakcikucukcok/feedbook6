  <title>Mickey Mantle - Memories and Memorabilia - Larry Canale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;When it comes to sports memorabilia, Mantle is king. No other sports athlete has been covered more or is more popular than Mantle, bar none. No one comes close.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#151;T.S. O&#39;Connell, editor of &lt;i&gt;Sports Collector&#39;s Digest&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mickey Mantle is one of the most beloved sports figures of all times. Playing brilliantly for the New York Yankees, Mantle won three American League Most Valuable Player Awards and was named to 16 All Star games. He played on 12 pennant winners and seven World Series Championship clubs with the Yankees. He still holds records for most World Series home runs, RBIs, runs, walks, extra-base hits, and total bases, all topped off by his induction in the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1974.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifteen years after his death, his memorabilia is still the most sought after of any sports figures past or present. &lt;i&gt;Mickey Mantle: Memories and Memorabilia&lt;/i&gt; highlights the life, memories, and memorabilia of one of American sports&#39; all time greatest heroes. With over 600 images of fantastic photography and artwork, no book on the market captures the history, nostalgia, memories, and memorabilia of the man they call &quot;The Mick.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
