  <title>The Longest Shot - Neil Sagebiel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The inspirational story of the unknown golfer from Iowa who beat his idol in the 1955 U.S. Open&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the overlooked Jack Fleck still playing the course, NBC-TV proclaimed that the legendary Ben Hogan had won his record fifth U.S. Open and signed off from San Francisco. Undaunted, the forgotten Iowan rallied to overcome a nine-shot deficit over the last three rounds--still a U.S. Open record--and made a pressure-packed putt to tie Hogan on the final hole of regulation play. The two men then squared off in a tense, 18-hole playoff from which Fleck emerged victorious in one of the most startling upsets in sports history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On par with the classic golf narratives of Mark Frost and John Feinstein, &lt;i&gt;The Longest Shot&lt;/i&gt; will surprise and delight fans as they trace the improbable journey of an unheralded  former caddie who played his way into the record books by out-dueling the sport&#39;s greatest champion of his time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
