  <title>Weathering for Railway Modellers - George Dent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Weathering is not just about making something look dirty.  Rather, it should be seen as an artistic endeavour, with the aim of making a model appear as lifelike as possible.  It also helps to blend a range of separate structures into a cohesive scene.  Careful weathering brings out the best in even the most mundane model, drawing attention to moulded relief and enhancing surface textures.  In this latest volume, expert modeller George Dent shares his theories and practices on the art of weathering buildings, motor vehicles, ships and all manner of scenic features.  Topics include: A guide to paints, washes, dry powders and other weathering media. Simple techniques for maximizing realism on all types of buildings and structures. Effective methods for weathering road vehicles, machinery and ships: innovative techniques for reproducing peeling paint, corrosion and bare timber effects: using an airbrush effectively as part of the weathering process. Plus simple approaches to making authentic muddy tracks, road surfaces, platforms, railway track and infrastructure. Suitable for railway modellers of all abilities, scales and eras.  Superbly illustrated in step-by-step format with 438 colour photographs. George Dent is an expert railway modeller and is Deputy Editor at Model Rail magazine. A follow up to the highly successful Weathering for Railway Modellers Volume 1: Locomotives and Rolling Stock." />
