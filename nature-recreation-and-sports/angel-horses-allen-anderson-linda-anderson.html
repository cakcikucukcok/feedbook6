  <title>Angel Horses - Allen Anderson, Linda Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This inspiring collection of stories tells of the hope and healing that come from contact between horses and people. Whether giving disabled riders a sense of freedom and mobility, healing wounds of childhood abuse, assisting with work, or simply riding trails with their human companions, horses bond with people in ways that change us for the better.
The stories, contributed by people from all over the country and from all walks of life, introduce: Cholla, the horse who paints pictures; a veterinarian who was reminded of the importance of compassion by a dying horse and a Native American chief; Star, a horse who saved a teenage girl from suicide; the late-blooming rider who embarrassed a horse and learned an important lesson about respecting the feelings of others — even if they have four legs; and many others. Every horse lover knows that horses, whether running through fields or performing intricate dressage drills, carry not only their riders but also messages of unconditional love and hope." />
