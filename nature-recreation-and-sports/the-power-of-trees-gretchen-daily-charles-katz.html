  <title>The Power of Trees - Gretchen Daily, Charles Katz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Intimate in size yet quietly breathtaking in scope, this graceful gift book will forever change how you think, and how you feel, about trees. In poetically sparse scientific observations, renowned conservation biologist Gretchen Daily narrates the evolution, impact, and natural wonder of trees. Alongside photographs by Chuck Katz, the text and images form a quiet and moving meditation on &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;The Power of Trees&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Twenty-six duotone black and white photographs illustrate the development of trees: how trunks were formed, what tree rings tell us about human societies, and how trees define the future of humanity. Pictures of trees threading through the landscape - dotting mountainsides, braiding along the sides of glassine rivers - bear witness to the lyrical force and clarity of Daily&#39;s observations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Recreating the authors&amp;#8217; hike together through the landscape of the Skagit River in Washington State, the balletic movement between Daily&amp;#8217;s commentary and Katz&amp;#8217;s vision reaches out to readers, inviting them to enjoy the landscape through a scientific understanding of trees. At once emotional and intellectual, &lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;The Power of Trees&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; is the first collection of nature photographs that invites the reader to not only delight in the gorgeous play between light and shadow, but also the fascinating natural mechanisms that create such striking natural beauty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An ecologist by training, Gretchen Daily is an internationally acclaimed conservancy advocate and scholar. Her role as a National Trustee for The Nature Conservancy will feature prominently in the national marketing campaign to bridge the gap between scientific educators and the general nature reader.&lt;/div&gt;" />
