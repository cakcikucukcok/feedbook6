She does this by focussing on ideas and themes as starting points, looking at the creative processes involved and more unusual techniques. Laura Reiter also covers how to use materials creatively - watercolour, acrylics, mixed media and collage - and how to experiment with colour and composition. There is also details on texture, simple printing, mark making, colour and its meaning, and sources of inspiration. Several projects are included, and, in addition to Laura&#39;s vibrant, colourful paintings, the work of several other contemporary abstract artists is featured.
