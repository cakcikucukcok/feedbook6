  <title>A Disa Companion - Eric Harley, Sid Cywes, Peter Linder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Disas are a genus of African orchids which are not well known even to orchid enthusiasts in Africa. However, not only are many of the species colourful and/or spectacular but they have given great scope to breeders wishing to hybridise and market ever more colourful varieties. They have specific cultural requirements, but, like most things -&#39;they are easy when you know how&#39;. This book has a variety of aims: it provides an introduction to the fascination and diversity of Disa species; it provides information on how to grow them in the garden or greenhouse, helped by a description of weather and other aspects of their how they grow in the wild; and a section on genetics assists in understanding the basics of colour variation in species and hybrids. Finally, a section on hybridisation demonstrates the remarkable diversity of form, colour and patterns that can be achieved by within- and between-species crosses, with numerous illustrations to back up the claim that Disas are one of the most fascinating and visually appealing of orchids to study, admire, and, with a minimum of skill, grow." />
