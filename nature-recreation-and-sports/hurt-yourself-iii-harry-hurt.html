  <title>Hurt Yourself - Iii Harry Hurt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Harry Hurt III is a journalist and professional dilettante who puts it all on the line in the search for freedom and joy in the most unlikely of places. And the likely ones, too. &lt;br&gt;Whether he&#39;s flying a vintage Mustang, risking his neck at polo, or risking his dignity dancing with the New York City Ballet, Hurt gives the readers of his &quot;Executive Pursuits&quot; columns in &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; a Plimpton-esque glimpse of the adventures hidden just around the corner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hurt writes about hedonism, but the columns collected for the first time here in &lt;i&gt;Hurt Yourself&lt;/i&gt; are really about finding fulfillment as a man in the second half of his life. He writes about marriage, as he gets into, and out of, trouble with wife; fatherhood, as he struggles to connect with his son; and manhood, as he battles the demons of vanity, insecurity, and fear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through it all, Hurt tackles each premise--from playing quarterback for the New York Jets to finding a swim suit a middle-aged man can actually wear--with self-deprecating humor and an unfailingly honest journalist&#39;s eye.&lt;/p&gt;" />
