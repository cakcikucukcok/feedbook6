  <title>My Tiny Garden - Lucy Scott, Jon Cardwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Think you don’t have enough room to green up your act? Not everyone has access to outside space or what we traditionally think of as a garden, but we all have window ledges, doorways, stairways and unloved spots. My Tiny Garden is bursting with exciting ideas and savvy solutions to help you transform any neglected nook into a plant paradise. With mini meadows, blooming balconies and plant-packed pavements, we’ve unearthed over 25 amazing unconventional green spaces. Meet the friends who developed a living wall inside their LA office, the London firefighter who rescued a neglected roof terrace, and the Berlin-based photographer who found a picture-perfect community garden at an abandoned airport. You’ll pick up all the best tips and tricks as each gardener shares their small-scale expertise, from pots on wheels to vertical planters. Packed with practical advice and design ideas, the latest title in Pavilion&#39;s exciting gardening series also provides pointers on key aspects of cultivation - from planting suggestions through to after-planting maintenance and the lowdown on which plants will prosper in which place. Plus, practical projects including an aquatic terrarium, an alpine wall planter and a desktop garden will help you make the most of every inch. Whether you’re looking to create a tropical oasis, a flower-filled patch, or a wildlife wonderland, get inspired, let your imagination grow and enjoy your tiny garden." />
