  <title>Noah into the African Unknown - Douglas Floen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="NOAHS NEW ADVENTURES
Not content to stay at home on Wild Wold Farm and empowered with special abilities, Noahs imaginative powers take him into wildest Africa where he meets and gets to know a wide variety of animals; cheetahs, giraffes, hippos, rhinos and monkeys along with many others.
Because of his mission from Mother Nature or Gaia, to bring help to the persecuted wildlife, Noah is able to move without harm among these beasts, many of whom would otherwise devour or destroy him.
Gaia has asked Noah to observe and bring help if he can. Noah, at first is very unsure and hesitant in this violent and bloody environment where life is constantly in danger. After making friends with the cheetah, Raina, and saving her two cubs from poachers he learns to gain confidence in his abilities.
Poachers and hunters have brought havoc to the wildlife of Africa. Baby animals are taken from their parents to be sold to collectors and never to be seen again. Elephants and rhinos are shot dead or trapped for their tusks and horns. Wild cats such as leopards and cheetahs are murdered for their beautiful skins to be made into fur coats for people living far away.
After many hair-raising adventures, Noah does bring help  surprising help in the form of the dreaded humans who create a safe haven for all of the animals who can now live in peace and pursue their lives in safety.
Through the eyes of an insignificant mouse, this book vividly illustrates the struggles that endangered animals have for survival." />
