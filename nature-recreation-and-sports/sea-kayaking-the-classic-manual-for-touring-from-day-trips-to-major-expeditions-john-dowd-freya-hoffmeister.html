  <title>Sea Kayaking: The Classic Manual for Touring, from Day Trips to Major Expeditions - John Dowd, Freya Hoffmeister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Still regarded as &amp;#147;the bible&amp;#8221; for both new and experienced kayakers after more than thirty years in print, Sea Kayaking covers the basics of equipment and technique, including types of paddles and strokes, as well as such essential skills as how to read the weather and the water, how to navigate with and without GPS and how to travel with a group. Drawing on his many years of experience paddling in all climates, John Dowd presents practical advice on dealing with potential hazards (from surf to sea ice to sharks), carrying out rescues and planning for long-distance expeditions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;New for this edition are hints about digital technologies for planning and navigating while kayak touring as well as lots of tips for outfitting boats, adapting equipment and finessing fishing technique while kayak angling&amp;#151;whether casting and jigging for fun on a day trip or trolling for dinner on a longer expedition. Also fully updated are the sections on managing risk and the inspiring stories of adventure, including Freya Hoffmeister&amp;#8217;s record-breaking circumnavigation of Australia and Japanese paddlers&amp;#8217; increasingly challenging trips around the islands and beyond.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As a sport, sea kayaking continues to evolve. Once the sport of a very few long-distance paddlers embarking on international expeditions, then the recreational pursuit of many weekend tourers, sea kayaking is now popular with many day trippers as well. As more and more paddlers take to the water&amp;#151;for the day, the weekend or many months, this classic guide continues to be required reading for those seeking adventure on the open ocean.&lt;/div&gt;" />
