  <title>101 Longeing and Long Lining Exercises: English &amp; Western - Cherry Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you are like most people, you know what you want your horse to do and how you want him to behave. You want your training experiences to be safe and enjoyable for both you and your horse. But maybe you aren&#39;t sure what to do and when. In 101 Longeing and Long Lining Exercises you&#39;ll find complete ground training lesson plans from square 1 to square 101. Cherry Hill starts with basic in-hand and free longeing lessons, then takes you through the addition of a longe line, cavesson, bridle, surcingle, side reins, saddle, and long lines. You&#39;ll learn a wide variety of ground training exercises suitable for both English and Western horses. In-hand section:&lt;br&gt;* Fancy footwork&lt;br&gt;* Whip works&lt;br&gt;* Pitching a wave&lt;br&gt;* Turn on the forehand&lt;br&gt;* Sidepass&lt;br&gt;* Longeing section:&lt;br&gt;* Stop, look, and listen&lt;br&gt;* Outside turns&lt;br&gt;* Inside turns&lt;br&gt;* Whip talk Spirals&lt;br&gt;* Wagon wheels&lt;br&gt;* Bending tune-up&lt;br&gt;* Contact and collection&lt;br&gt;* Long lining section:&lt;br&gt;* Long line lingo&lt;br&gt;* Yin y ang&lt;br&gt;* Figure-8&lt;br&gt;* Serpentines&lt;br&gt;* Backing&lt;br&gt;* Cavalletti work&lt;br&gt;* Trail obstacles&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each of the exercises is laid out with a diagram, step-by-step instructions, and an explanation of its benefits.
