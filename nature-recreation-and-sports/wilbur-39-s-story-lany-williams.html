  <title>Wilbur&#39;s Story - Lany Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wilbur is just ten weeks old when his new owner brings him home from the local animal shelter. Life is different in the suburbs for this little orange tiger-striped kitten. With his narrow chin, flat head, and pointy ears, he looks and feels a bit devilish. And he doesn&#39;t appreciate being named after a pig.&lt;p&gt;
Told from the perspective of this mischievous feline, &lt;i&gt;Wilbur&#39;s Story&lt;/i&gt; follows the tales and adventures of Wilbur as he settles into life with author Lany Williams. From getting hit by a truck and fighting with other cats, Wilbur suffers through many medical emergencies. Life with this cat is never dull as he leaves gifts of dead and not-so-dead mice and meets up with other local wildlife in his own backyard.&lt;p&gt; 
Follow Wilbur&#39;s amusing anecdotes as he meets his first coyote, experiences his first flood, and moves into a new home. Although a bit naughty at times, Wilbur earns the love and affection and becomes a cherished pet and friend for life." />
