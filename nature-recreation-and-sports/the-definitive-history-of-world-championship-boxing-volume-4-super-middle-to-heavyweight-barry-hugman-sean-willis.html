  <title>The Definitive History of World Championship Boxing: Volume 4: Super Middle to Heavyweight - Barry Hugman, Sean Willis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This epic book is the result of more than 30 years of research by world renowned boxing historian Barry J. Hugman, who has scoured libraries, newspapers and relevant institutions across several countries to pull together the most complete history of world championship boxing. Invaluable assistance on early British material has been provided by Harold Alderman MBE. From the 1870s to October 2016 all newly discovered and known world championship bouts, from super middle to heavyweight, have been chronologically listed, together with the result and brief fight summary and, where known, the venues, scorecards and referees are provided too. It&#39;s a story of amazing fights, questionable decisions, riots, police intervention, scandals, and bravery, featuring countless legends of the ring. This book forms one part of a unique 4-volume series which together, combining in excess of an incredible one-and-a-quarter million words, presents the most comprehensive history of world championship boxing ever published! And reading on your Kindle or tablet is a convenient way to read this 493 page reference book for a fraction of the cost and weight of the printed edition." />
