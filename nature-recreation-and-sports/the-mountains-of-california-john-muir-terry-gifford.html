  <title>The Mountains of California - John Muir, Terry Gifford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘How glorious a greeting the sun gives the mountains! To behold this alone is worth the pains of any excursion a thousand times over.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;John Muir&lt;/b&gt; is known internationally for his dedication to protecting the environment and for founding &lt;b&gt;The Sierra Club&lt;/b&gt; in 1892. His first book, as Muir authority &lt;b&gt;Terry Gifford&lt;/b&gt; writes in the foreword, ‘became the bible of the fledgling Sierra Club, which is now a major national environmental activists’ organisation with branches in every corner of America’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Mountains of California&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; not only details Muir’s visits to the magnificent mountains along the &lt;b&gt;Sierra Nevada Range&lt;/b&gt;, which he affectionately calls ‘The Range of Light’, but also the stunning &lt;b&gt;glaciers&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;forests&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;landscapes&lt;/b&gt; that he encounters: &lt;i&gt;‘Climbing higher, I saw for the first time the gradual dwarfing of the pines in compliance with climate … patches of the dwarf vaccinium with its round flowers sprinkled in the grass like purple hail; while in every direction the landscape stretched sublimely away in fresh wildness: a manuscript written by the hand of nature alone.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the book, Muir’s philosophy of nature’s ability to soothe and amaze is evident. He heart-warmingly discusses at length how his encounters with animals, such as the Douglas squirrel, cheered him so. This is a truly beautiful read; Muir’s writing, embedded with emotion, wit, and at times, humour, will never fail to speak to his reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enthusiasm contained within these pages is infectious, and as well as making a powerful read, Muir will inspire you, too, to ‘come and see’ the innumerable delights that nature can offer:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;‘The best words only hint at [California’s] charms. Come to the mountains and see.’&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
