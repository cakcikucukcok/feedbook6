      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sutton&#39;s Complicit is a powerful play that explores the world&#39;s current political climate and the consequences that arise when civil liberties become a privilege rather than a universal right.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s a hard road; there&#39;s an easy road - which one would you take? Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Ben Kritzer finds himself faced with this very dilemma, as he is stands in front of a Supreme Court Grand Jury. Will Kritzer defend his belief in the freedom of the press, or will he protect his family from the threats facing them?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Refusing to hold any punches, Complicit is a political thriller bound to have you questioning your belief in the state and personal security. Gritty, provocative and poignant, Complicit is a thought-provoking and timely play with deep rooted significance within our society. A production directed by Kevin Spacey opens at the Old Vic Theatre, London in February 2009.&lt;/p&gt;" />
