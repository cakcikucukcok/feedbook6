  <title>The Last Stand - Bill Bowling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My family and the generations before us are deer hunters. In recent years the popularity of huntng the whitetail deer has greatly increased and with it commercialization. Everything seems to be focused on killing, scoring, and the record book - not hunting. For the wealthy, one can actually be guaranteed to &quot;harvest&quot; a record book deer for upwards of $20,000. What happened to the passion for hunting and family heritage? I have that passion. It was passed on to me by my grandfather and I, in turn, passed it on to my two sons. The &quot;Last Stand&quot; is not a how-to book but I felt it was time for me to express what hunting means to us and why it&#39;s important to hunt ethically. Remember one thing, it&#39;s not important how many deer you kill or how many fish you catch but what you experience along the way." />
