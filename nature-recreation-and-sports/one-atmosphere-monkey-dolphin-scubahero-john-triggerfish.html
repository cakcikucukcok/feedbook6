  <title>One Atmosphere: Monkey Dolphin Scubahero - John Triggerfish</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name&#39;s John Triggerfish and I&#39;m a scuba diving legend. Jacques Cousteau has nothing on me. He might have been the pioneer of underwater exploration but I&#39;m the sub aqua king; and what I don&#39;t know about diving and adventure isn&#39;t worth knowing. I&#39;ve come a long way in a big way. Especially in a few Thai bar girls; but that was yesteryear and this is now. I&#39;m currently at the top of my game with hundreds of diving hours under my weight belt and this time it&#39;s as close to a true tale as you can get, nearly. There&#39;s a monkey involved in this story. Everybody loves a cheeky monkey. There&#39;s sharks too. Everybody loathes sharks because sharks are sharp toothed evil motherfuckers that cause unnecessary chunky chum filled limb losing watery death. There&#39;s a dolphin. There&#39;s a beautiful dolphin straight out of a fairytale, because every good book has to have a dolphin in it. This is a story about returning from Mexico in one piece and making friends. Yeah. Real friends." />
