  <title>Chamonix - Mont Blanc and the Aiguilles Rouges - a Guide for Skiers - Anselme Baud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Discover the skiing downhills of the Chamonix Mountain in this very detailed and documented book, written by one of the most talented skiers of his generation.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Located at the very heart of the highest mountains of Europe, the majestic Chamonix massif stands as a reference among the most sacred skiing places in the world. When winter comes, this snow-addict heaven offers a unique range of dream slopes, from the easiest to the most breathtakingly high ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anselme Baud is an extreme skiing leading head and one of the best experts of this mountain. From classic skiing hikes to mountaineering competitions, this guide book presents a precise description of all the biggest slopes this mythic area could offer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this volume you can find all the information about Chamonix.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Thanks to his charming accounts and instructive advice, Anselme Baud shares with us his precious and wide experience as a high mountain guide and an exceptional skier.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHOR&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Born in Morzine in 1948, Anselme Baud left his mark on the Alps skiing steep slopes history. As a high mountain guide in 1973, he was one the first to ski on extreme downhills in the Alps, the Andes, in Antarctica or in the Himalayas. As an ENSA professor, he supervised during several years the mountain guides trainings in Bolivia and Nepal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;EXCERPT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We now come to the Chamonix Aiguilles and the final section of the Mont Blanc Massif. You can’t miss the Chamonix ‘Needles’ as you arrive in this, the capital of mountaineering. Above and behind them, forming the heart of the Massif, sit Mont Blanc and its surrounding peaks (the Tacul, Maudit and Goûter), which have made the valley famous.&lt;br&gt;There are two different approaches to skiing in this area:&lt;br&gt;– classic ski-touring, with its 1 to 2-day climbs and long descents that require mountaineering skills and experience as this is a high mountain environment crossing glaciated terrain;&lt;br&gt;– the ‘new wave’ of freeriders. Using the cable-cars means you can shorten or completely avoid long climbs up to some of the routes in this area, and the approach to the valley’s ‘mythic’ descents, such as the north face of the Aiguille du Midi, can be relatively quick and easy. In fact, from the start of winter a veritable festival of freerider descents is played out before our eyes. Just after a large fall of snow, the slopes on the Glacier Rond, the Cosmiques Couloir and many other routes become almost ‘snow parks’, which would have been inconceivable 30 years ago…" />
