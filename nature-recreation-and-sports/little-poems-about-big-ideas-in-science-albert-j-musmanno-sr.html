  <title>Little Poems About Big Ideas in Science - Albert J. Musmanno Sr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The magic of Rhyme has made learning easier and more enjoyable for my students and science workshop participants over my 41 years of writing and using my Science poems and songs. Ill share that magic with you through the pages of my book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Musmanno invites you to enjoy learning the important science education involved in the NSTAs And New Jersey Science Core Curriculum content Standards. The poems in the book will be easy and enjoyable to learn because they rhyme. For example, you will learn about an insect from the  grasshopper poem. The chorus to the poem goesI am an insect, Ive got six legs you see. And three parts to my bodyI am an insect. The magic of rhyme will make learning easier most of the time. Many years ago, when I first started teaching, I was told that the vice principal would be coming in to evaluate my lesson on the upcoming Monday. I was worried and wanted to do my best. We were studying the cell and the vocabulary included the wordsendoplasmic reticulum, mitochondrion, protoplasm, etc.. A lot of my students had trouble reading so I had to develop a lesson that would enable them to be able to pronounce, read and understand the vocabulary and the lesson about the cell. I was a lead singer in a band in my younger years and realized that  the rhymes to the lyrics of the songs made it easy for me to remember and understand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I wrote my first science poem and science songThe Cell. I drew the parts of the cell on the board, labeled them and explained what the parts did. The students copied the drawing and the information. Then as a review of the lesson, we read the cell poem. The kids were able to pronounce the words and understand them through the magic of rhyme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The kids loved it and my principal said it was a great lesson and great poem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the poems in my book to help you or someone else near you understand the concepts of Science. I even invited my students to write Science poems about the science we were studying. They even wrote Science Songs. I taught for 41 years using my poems and songs about science to stir up the magic of rhyme in my classroom and science workshops to make the learning easier and more enjoyable. I was even sent to Puerto Rico and South Korea to teach Science teachers and school principals hands on Science lessons and share my poems and songs with them. Theyre probably using my poems and songs right now. Now Ive included many of them in my book. Enjoy the magic of rhyme to make your learning easier and more enjoyable most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
