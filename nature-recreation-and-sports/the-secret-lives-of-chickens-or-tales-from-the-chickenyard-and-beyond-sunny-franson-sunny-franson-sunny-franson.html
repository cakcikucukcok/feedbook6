  <title>The Secret Lives of Chickens: or Tales from the Chickenyard and Beyond - Sunny Franson, Sunny Franson, Sunny Franson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Secret Lives of Chickens pulls us into a time and place that seem simpler but actually are not, because of the feathered inhabitants within.        At some point in time, each and every life is deeply touched by something or someone special. It doesn&#39;t matter who or what it is, because the soul recognizes and responds to what is honest and true, to a bright sunflower, to endless, soothing ocean waves, and to the soft cooing of contented chickens.       They have their own culture that is more complex than we assume. They are stalwart little feathered beings that live with equanimity in the world around them, following the time-honored rules of the flock, day in and day out, in a generally pleasant and peaceful frame of mind.  These are tales that happened over many years&#39; time, but with chickens, it seems there is always more to learn." />
