  <title>The Hockey Method - Bob De La Salle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Expectations are too high for beginners in hockey. Beginners are simply not ready for team play and systems. What is missing is a transition phase from the first time a player puts on a pair of skates to that first hockey game. 
The Hockey Method is a methodology to fill in this missing link or gap in hockey development. It identifies skill levels that can be grading to track player proficiency. The Hockey Method consists of two parts; Book 1  Beginner Skating and Book 2  Beginner Puck Control.  These two parts present 31 skill concepts that are so simple and easy to learn that you dont need to be a coach to teach them. What is really needed, for first timers, is one-on-one direction and instruction. Coaches or parents can do it but parents are a better choice to instruct beginners because they have the time and vested interest to dedicate the 1 on 1 instruction needed by beginners at this early age.
The basic idea is to build confidence by learning to walk before you run, run before you glide, and to be able to turn the toes in and out before you are able to use edges." />
