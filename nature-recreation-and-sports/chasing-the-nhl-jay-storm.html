  <title>Chasing the NHL - Jay Storm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An Inspirational True Story!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chasing the NHL is the story of a fresh-faced, overlooked, NHL-caliber hockey player named Trent Daavettila and insurance agent Jay Storm. Jay and Trent meet while playing men&amp;rsquo;s league hockey together in small-town Michigan. Jay immediately recognizes that Trent&amp;rsquo;s talents are above and beyond everyone else on the ice and sets off on a quest to get Trent a shot at the NHL, in an attempt to land a pro hockey contract.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a story of enthusiasm, optimism, and persistence that transcends professional sports, and is relatable to anyone who has ever thought to chase their dreams and make the most of their talents. Based on the real-life story of a small-town hockey hero, Chasing the NHL offers a nitty-gritty, up-close-and-personal account of the obstacles this extreme athletic talent overcame, as well as the accolades he received. Trent was overlooked until the age most other players at his level had established careers. Along with the late-blooming development of Trent&amp;rsquo;s hockey talent come all the trials and tribulations of adulthood, as well as the joys, such as marriage and children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Follow the story of Trent Daavettila and Jay Storm as the two of them work tirelessly with minor league hockey teams across North America to achieve their dream of reaching the NHL.&lt;/p&gt;" />
