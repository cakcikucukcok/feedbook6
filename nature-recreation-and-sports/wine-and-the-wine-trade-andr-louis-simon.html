  <title>Wine and the Wine Trade - André Louis Simon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“ …Whether we drink wine or not, we have everything to gain and nothing to lose by knowing a few elementary truths about it.
Where does the Vine grow and where are different wines made ? What kind of a Trade is the English Wine Trade ? What about those wines which we hear and read about so often : Port, Champagne, Claret, Burgundy, Sherry, Hock and Moselle ?
These are the questions which I have attempted to answer in the present book.  In the present work, I have endeavoured to compass under the smallest possible volume the greatest number of elementary truths about Wine and the English Wine Trade, in order that the general public in England might acquire, should they desire to do so, a little more knowledge than they appear to possess about one of the greatest of all God&#39;s gifts to man : WINE.” (1921 – André Louis Simon)" />
