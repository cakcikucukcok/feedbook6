  <title>In Pursuit of Wild Edibles: A Forager&#39;s Tour - Jeffrey Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we care about the source of our food as much as the preparation, so     it is no surprise that foodies have discovered wild edibles. From the most upscale restaurants     in New York to humble farm stays in Europe, chefs and restaurant-goers alike are seeking     pleasure in food found in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;In Pursuit of     Wild Edibles: A Forager&#39;s Tour&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of one man passionate about     finding wild edibles and creating recipes to highlight their unique flavors. An American     expatriate, poet, and gourmet living in France, Jeffrey Greene has scoured the fields, rivers,     and beaches of Europe and his native New England in search of foods ranging from puffballs and     periwinkles to stone pine nuts and gooseneck barnacles. For many, foraging is the latest trend     in foodie culture, but for Greene this journey stretches back to his childhood, when his parents     fled New York City to a shack-like house in rural Connecticut. Convinced they could live off the     land, the family raised goats, planted gardens, gathered seafood at the nearby coast, and     foraged for food from the woods. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by these     childhood experiences, Greene and his wife, Mary, bought and restored an old priory in rural     Burgundy. Surrounded by forests, they learned to identify mushrooms and greens, and devoted     themselves to inventing recipes for them. Thus began a pursuit that took Greene to the Polish     Carpathians, the Appennines overlooking the Ligurian coast, the shores of Normandy and Brittany,     and to Plymouth, Massachusetts, where the Pilgrims eked out their first winter in near     starvation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greene&#39;s captivating book offers     experienced foragers and novices alike an extensive sampling of his own recipes and a chance to     come along with him on his international adventures. From razor clams and wild sea urchins, to     young nettles and dandelion greens, to wild strawberries and cherries, Greene showcases the     beauty of what one can cook up in a truly wild recipe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
