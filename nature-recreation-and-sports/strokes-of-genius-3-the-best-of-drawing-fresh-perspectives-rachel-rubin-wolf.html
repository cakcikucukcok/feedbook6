In addition to traditional pencil, charcoal and ink, you&amp;#8217;ll find a number of scratchboard, colored pencil and mixed-media works. Subject matter ranges from timeworn city architecture to portraits of beloved dogs, including such perennial favorites as landscapes, harbor scenes, flowers, still life, the human figure and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#183; 140 world-class drawings, from simple, direct sketches to meticulously layered works of art selected from thousands of submissions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#183; Exciting mix of styles, mediums and techniques, presented in subject-specific chapters: Town &amp;amp; County, Portraits, Pets, Still Life, The Human Figure and Wildlife&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#183; Artists&amp;#8217; commentary on the concepts and techniques behind each piece&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further explore the &amp;#8220;Fresh Perspectives&amp;#8221; theme, each featured artist was asked to finish the phrase, &amp;#8220;Drawing is&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221; Their responses, scattered throughout, add yet another dimension to this book:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Drawing is a moment of poetry.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Drawing is to art what physics is to science.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Drawing is art stripped to its bare bones.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, it is the art itself that will cause you to keep this volume handy on the coffee table or bookshelf for when you want to curl up, look at the world through these artists&amp;#8217; eyes, and come away with a more vivid sense of what drawing is&amp;#8212;or can be&amp;#8212;to you.
