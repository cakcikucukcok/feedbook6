  <title>Improving speed play for fast break situations (TU 4) - Jörg Madinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The objective of this training unit is to improve free play in fast break situations. Following warm-up and a short game, the players play long passes during the ball familiarization phase which will be further developed in the goalkeeper warm-up shooting exercise. This is followed by a series of shots requiring precise passes. Afterwards, the players practice free play in outnumbered, open situations during fast breaks. A closing game with gradually increasing complexity completes this training unit.
The training unit consists of the following key exercises:
- Warm-up/Stretching (individual exercise: 10 minutes/total time: 10 minutes)
- Short game (10/20)
- Ball familiarization (10/30)
- Goalkeeper warm-up shooting (10/40)
- Offense/Series of shots (10/50)
- Offense/Small groups (15/65)
- Offense/Small groups (10/75)
- Closing game (15/90)
Total training time: 90 minutes
Difficulty: Medium level (youth teams under 15 years of age and adult teams)" />
