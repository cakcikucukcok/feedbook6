  <title>The Samurai Mind: Lessons from Japan&#39;s Master Warriors (Classic texts on cultivating mental discipline and achieving victory) - Christopher Hellman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Samurai Mind&lt;/I&gt; is a collection of five seminal Japanese texts that convey the essence of traditional samurai philosophy and ethic from very different, but complementary points of view.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These texts range from the ferocious to the esoteric&amp;#8212;with their common thread being the importance of mastering one&#39;s own mind as the key to overcoming opponents. Written from the mid-18th to early 19th century, the authors were acknowledged master samurai warriors keen to address a broader audience beyond their circle of students and acolytes. Their aim was to explain their craft to the outside world, and they do so with great insight.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;The five classic Japanese texts are:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Mysterious Skills of the Old Cat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sword Theory&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Treatise on the Sword&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Joseishi&#39;s Discussions on the Sword&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ignorance in Swordsmanship&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; Four of the five texts presented here are translated into English for the first time making &lt;I&gt;The Samurai Mind&lt;/I&gt; an important addition to the literature on Japanese martial arts and a valuable resource for all martial artists. The martial arts philosophy book is an informative look at the samurai of Japan with particular emphasis on the samurai&#39;s relationship with his sword&amp;#8212;the most fabled weapon in history&amp;#8212;and on his need to cultivate mental discipline to achieve his&lt;/div&gt;" />
