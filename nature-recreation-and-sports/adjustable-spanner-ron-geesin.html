  <title>Adjustable Spanner - Ron Geesin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Adjustable Spanner is the product of thirty years&#39; collecting and original research, fired by Ron Geesin&#39;s acquisition of the SLIK adjustable spanner that hung in his father&#39;s garage. At the core of this book is a concise history of this much-maligned tool. Serious and comical observations parallel its chequered life, from its bent beginnings in the blacksmith&#39;s shop to over-designed and lovingly engineered treasures from the small Birmingham machinist. Around this core are discussions and findings about components and construction on the practical side, and patents, registered designs and trade marks on the design protection side. Emerging from history, we take a closer look at uses and especially abuses, immerse ourselves in an analysis of types and styles, and dive deeply into the histories of the inventors and makers. You will be amazed at the engineering diversity required to produce these most fanciful but essential supports to the Industrial Revolution. This entertaining account is the result of the author&#39;s findings, stemming from his collecting over 3,000 examples and will be of particular interest to engineers, those concerned with industrial history and collectors of hand tools. Superbly illustrated with around 300 colour photographs." />
