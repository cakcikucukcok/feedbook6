  <title>Glorious Battle Cry - William E. Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Web Site Book Description
	The entertainment and sports transformation of Atlanta Georgia began with the arrival of the Atlanta Braves baseball team in 1964 and didnt slow down until the 1996 Olympic Games. Every type of sporting event either passed through or called Atlanta home - except thoroughbred horse racing. 
       Long known for its attraction to gamblers and underworld figures horseracing has always lived under a cloak of suspicion. Here is a story about a man with a tremendous stroke of luck who set out to remove that cloak and bring horse racing into the limelight. Not as a game of chance, where people squander away their money and their futures trying to hit the big payout, but as a sport of competition between the fastest and most enduring athletes on earth.
	Come on in and meet the players of this complex game of strategy and discover that they are typical Americans with the heart and desire to chase after their dreams. 
        Go back and follow the history of Atlantas transformation from an ordinary southern town into a thriving metropolitan city.  Realize that the cloak of suspicion placed on horse racing could also apply to any professional sport when people stray from the path of honesty and morality.
	Inside you will find the formula and all of the ingredients to change the face of horse racing as you look into the hearts and souls of the people who are there for the love of the game. 
	In this age of ultra technology there is a great opportunity for a daring entrepreneur to create a great enterprise and leave his or her mark in history. Atlanta Georgia is home to an outgoing population that thrives on fun, adventure, and excitement. It is also the last best chance for horse racing to start over with a new set of rules casting the race horse as a competitive athlete instead of a number in an exotic lottery. 
	Glorious Battle Cry is a story about a man who lucks upon the oppurtunity to start his own racing  program with his own rules. Along with racing he offers everyone a look at some things and places that are beyond our horizon. He re-introduces horse racing to a new fan on a smaller and simpler scale. His goal is to restore credibility and preserve the rich rewards befitting a champion. 
       In the heart of the thoroughbred there is a wealth of history about horse racing that needs to be regarded and preserved. There are comedies and tragedies, stories about rags to riches, and riches to rags. There are stories about love and deceit, heroes and villans. There are stories about great races that have been told and written that can now come alive.
       Follow this story of an ordinary fellow with extraordinary dreams as he takes a bold, yet calculated, risk to chase an elusive dream, and along the way encounters lifes greatest tragedies which makes everything seem insignificant." />
