  <title>Magenta Style Paper Enchantments - Nathalie Metivier, Leslie Conron Carola</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Just what is it about Magenta projects? What makes them so distinctive? There is certainly color galore, texture that you can &quot;feel,&quot; and embellishments aplenty. Whatever the style, Magenta projects are built around simple, classic compositions. A card may be straightforward and symmetrical, the design centered on the page, or that same symmetric design may be shifted off-center to create an intriguing pattern. But there is always an unmistakable focal point that, with the addition of rich color and stunning embellishments, results in a grand surprise that delights the senses. This is the essence of Magenta, and the reason why Magenta materials and techniques are favored by paper crafters all over the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Magenta Style Paper Enchantments&lt;/i&gt; presents more than 70 projects that will inspire you to play with color, texture, and embellishments. 20 main projects offering various techniques are accompanied by a materials list and photographic step-by-step instructions, and the others appear in gallery sections in each of the 4 chapters.&lt;br&gt;Nathalie Metivier and Leslie Carola show you techniques like rubber stamping and coloring with a variety of media; embossing and debossing with ink; creating texture with Peel Off&#39;s stickers; making three-dimensional constructions; and decorating holiday ornaments and other tabletop items. Try the projects as they are. Then change the palette, shift the focal point, play with the details, find the art of the craft--Magenta Style.&lt;/p&gt;" />
