  <title>The Sky Devil - L. Ron Hubbard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Vic Kennedy is quick-witted and sharp-tongued with Nicholas Cage&amp;rsquo;s maverick sense of adventure, Vic&amp;rsquo;s flown out of trouble by the skin of his teeth . . . and straight into the jaws of disaster. Racing away from a date with an executioner, he lands in a Saharan oasis, where things are looking up. A gorgeous princess mistakes Vic for a genie, and if he gets his wish, the Sky Devil will have his day.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In  1933, when L. Ron Hubbard began his professional writing career, he  entered a crowded and competitive field. But he very quickly separated  from the pack, making a name for himself as a writer who was both good  and fast. So good and fast, in fact, that in 1935 the three stories  included in this volume were all published in the same issue of an  all-fiction magazine. Fully a quarter of the issue had been written by  Hubbard&amp;mdash;though readers didn&amp;rsquo;t know it, two of the stories appearing  under two different pseudonyms. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also includes the  adventures Buckley Plays a Hunch, in which an adventurer seeks to solve  the mystery of three castaways who refuse to be rescued, and Medals for  Mahoney, the story of man who journeys into the heart of darkness to  thwart a murderous conspiracy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
