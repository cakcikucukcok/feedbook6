  <title>Nimitz Class - Patrick Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s as big as the Empire State Building, a massive floating fortress at the throbbing heart of a U.S. Navy Carrier Battle Group. Its supersonic aircraft can level entire cities at a stroke. Its surveillance gear can track every target within thousands of square miles--in the air, on the surface, and under the sea. Its crew of six thousand works night and day to keep this awesome military machine at peak performance. It&#39;s a Nimitz-Class nuclear carrier, the most powerful weapons system on the planet. Nothing can touch it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So when the first stunned messages say only that the &lt;em&gt;Thomas Jefferson&lt;/em&gt; has disappeared, the Navy reacts with disbelief. But as her battered escorts report in, the truth becomes inescapable: a Nimitz-Class carrier has been claimed by nuclear catastrophe--the mightiest military unit on earth, vaporized without warning by an accidental detonation of unimaginable power. No other explanation is possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Navy maverick Bill Baldridge begins to investigate the disaster that claimed his idolized brother&#39;s life, another chilling alternative begins to emerge from the high-tech web of fleeting sonar contacts and elusive radar blips. It points to a rogue submarine commanded by a world-class undersea warrior with the steely nerve and cunning of a master spy. Suddenly it&#39;s up to Bill Baldridge to track down this shadowy nuclear terrorist, who has already turned America&#39;s ultimate weapon into the biggest sitting duck in history--and who still has another nuclear-tipped torpedo in his tubes. He&#39;s already proved he has the icy ruthlessness to incinerate six thousand sailors without a qualm. What will he do for an encore?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In these pages the modern military springs to life, form the Pentagon&#39;s tense conferences to the screaming flight deck of a giant carrier to the silent conning tower of an attack sub on full alert. But as Bill Baldridge races against time to pursue the nation&#39;s most deadly enemy, we are forced to ask ourselves serious real-life questions: Have defense budget cuts jeopardized our national security? Are we prepared to defend ourselves against naval terrorist? How safe are we? &lt;em&gt;Nimitz Class&lt;/em&gt; is a world-class techno-thriller with a plot as riveting as &lt;em&gt;Hunt for Red October&lt;/em&gt;--and an explosive twist out of tomorrow&#39;s headlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today it&#39;s a novel. Tomorrow it might be the news.&lt;/p&gt;" />
