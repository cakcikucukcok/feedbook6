&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hyaw Raw Yaw!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bernie McKay jumped and looked around in the dim room.&amp;nbsp; Someone was coming at him from the kitchen!&amp;nbsp; He had stumbled away from the stair, so he ran and ducked behind the couches around the coffee table, heart beating quickly.&amp;nbsp; It came into the light from the window.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No!&amp;nbsp; You&amp;#39;re dead!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Uncle Albert&amp;#39;s face gleamed waxily, pulled back and fixed into a scowl, teeth gleaming.&amp;nbsp; His eyes were swelling, popping out, despite the embalming.&amp;nbsp; He cawed and croaked, no longer able to speak intelligibly &amp;mdash; but hatred still animated him enough to send him shambling around the coffee table and its couches.&amp;nbsp; His best suit was incongruously festive, the diamond winking from his tie, shirt sleeves open where he&amp;#39;d lost his studs, black shoes scuffed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Harr Yaw!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Back &amp;mdash; get back&amp;mdash;&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Bernie danced sideways, spun a chair into the thing&amp;#39;s way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It patiently fumbled the fallen chair aside, never taking its gaze off him.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;Raw Raw Rawrr.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; It came on, not fast, not slow, more than ever like some wind-up machine, clumsy, powerful, unsophisticated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bernie was frightened, but despite that he had a sudden flood of unreality.&amp;nbsp; It was too absurd a picture, himself confronting this tenacious dead thing from which all rationality had departed.&amp;nbsp; What would the neighbors think?&amp;nbsp; A flash of anger shook him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You stupid asshole!&amp;quot; he barked.&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;You can&amp;#39;t come in here like this&amp;mdash;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ignoring him, it got close enough to lunge.&amp;nbsp; Sweating, Bernie danced around again, brief anger gone and choky fear back.&amp;nbsp; It wouldn&amp;#39;t ever stop coming&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp; He gripped the smaller of the couches.&amp;nbsp; When it turned and started for him again, he aimed the couch like a pool cue and thrust with panicky strength.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was too slow to dodge and was bowled over backward.&amp;nbsp; Shrieking You old bastard, Bernie was running for it even as it fell.&amp;nbsp; He grabbed a chair and made a full overhand sweep with it, staggering as its legs bounced off the ceiling.&amp;nbsp; It came down with diminished force on Uncle Albert&amp;#39;s unprotected head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wood or bone crunched, and Bernie raised the chair again, panting, glaring.&amp;nbsp; This time he swept it around in a lower arc, but the corpse let itself fall backward to raise its arms.&amp;nbsp; The chair crashed into them and did little harm.&amp;nbsp; Before he could pull it back, Uncle Albert, cawing, had seized it.&amp;nbsp; For a moment there was a nightmarish tug of war over the chair, then Bernie released it, falling back to the fireplace.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The corpse struggled slowly to its feet; Bernie wasted time fumbling for the poker because he couldn&amp;#39;t bear to look away from it.&amp;nbsp; When he finally had it, the corpse was upright and swinging the chair back over its head, stumbling toward him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Quickly Bernie ran at it, taking advantage of its slow clumsiness, to shove it.&amp;nbsp; But that brought him face to face with it, and into its evil putrid chemical odor.&amp;nbsp; He almost panicked, eyeball to eyeball with Death." />
