      <meta name="description" content="Called a baby, stupid, and weirdo, Burris Samson Debowski never fit in with any of the crowds of children in his neighborhood or school, and since he could remember he always wished his world would change. He got what he wished forWith others already thinking he was strange who would have ever thought he was a legend. 
A world in need of a hero, somehow linked to Burris Samson&#39;s current presence, had been calling to him for years. The visions. The voices only to be ignored by him in fear of going insane.  Not until the day of the field trip flight, did the world in need, finally get the chance and pulled Burris into its realm as death had his name next on its list.  Now, with the aid of a full-fledged magician and comical gnome, he shall overcome the many more obstacles, that stand in the way of destiny.  Though captured, Burris&#39;s adventures do not end there as a rescue attempt is in the works by two of the most unlikeliest people.
