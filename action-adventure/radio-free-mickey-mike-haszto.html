  <title>Radio Free Mickey - Mike Haszto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Enterthe everyday life of Mickey Miller, whoco-owns radio station WVVV, V-103, licensed to North Ridgeville, Ohio. He&#39;s married to asuccessful executive and Southern Belle, Leigh, and they have nine children. He&#39;s a very happy and well adjusted person who balances his career with his personal and family life...at least up until now.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Follow the rollercoaster ride that Mickey suddenly finds himself on when things around him begin to change. Station rumors. Media circus. Pressure and tension set in. He makes a few quirky decisions and then the seatbelt loosens on his life over the next six days.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Family issues add to the chaos already created...are the media rumors true that his station is being sold to corporate suits, who have been his stated enemy for years? After all, his love of radio is all about personal ownership and control, that radio is really for the listeners. Those corporate suits have been dominating radio for years since the deregulation laws took shape almost two decades ago.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Follow the path that Mickey takes in uncovering these rumors, and what needs to be done to meet the perceived challenges head-on.&lt;/P&gt;
