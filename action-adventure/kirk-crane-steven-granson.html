  <title>Kirk Crane - Steven Granson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They say time heals all wounds ... theyre wrong. The emptiness is still there as are the guilts. The passing of time has not lessened either.&lt;p&gt;
My name is Kirk ... Kirk Crane. Im big. Six-two the last time I was measured; maybe more now. To look at me youd think I was skinny. Youd be mistaken. Im two hundred and sixteen pounds of bedrock muscle. I can kill with guns or my hands and I have.&lt;p&gt;
What Im trying to say is Im not the type of person you would want to have a confrontation with. My friends, what few there were, found this comforting. My enemies, and there were many, did not feel the same.&lt;p&gt;
The hard thing is not knowing what you want to do ... the going back and forth with indecision. This was not my problem ... I had made my decision ... I knew what I was going to do." />
