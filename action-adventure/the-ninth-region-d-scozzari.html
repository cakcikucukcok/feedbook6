  <title>The Ninth Region - D. Scozzari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is a great time for celebration now that the Ice Lady, Polar Spirit, and Fire Prince have disappeared. Mom and Dad Sco, bear twins Gloria and Nathan, their brother, Nettle, and their newest family member, Vincent the overgrown frog, are journeying to the capital so King Otto can honor them for freeing the Ice Ladys captives. Once they arrive, Nettle is given the opportunity to earn knighthood by performing a task for King Otto: to bring him an old goats magical horn that, with its powers, will make the kingdom stronger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Vincent, Nettle travels outside the Ninth Region to a different reality. But what Nettle does not know is that the forces of the Fire Prince and the Polar Spirit are preparing wicked plans for Nettle, Vincent, and their new friends. Can Nettle overcome great obstacles in order to get the magical horn back to his King? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this suspenseful adventure, a young bear and a frog embark on a journey full of unknown paths, dangers, and risks as they attempt to take on evil forces in order to fulfill an important mission for a king. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This story is a great example of perseverance and keeping faith during challenging times   S. Veazey, teacher&lt;/p&gt;" />
