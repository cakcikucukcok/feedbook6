  <title>Rolling Thunder Stock Car Racing: Young Guns - Kent Wright, Don Keith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The pedal meets the metal in &lt;i&gt;Rolling Thunder Stock Car Racing--&lt;/i&gt;the thrilling series from Kent Wright and Don Keith that traces the history of stock car racing from the dusty dirt tracks of East Tennessee to the multi-million-dollar, high-tech venues of today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tracks are faster. The cars, too. But the hunger for speed--and the hunt for the checkered flag--hasn&#39;t changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jodell Bob Lee has long since retired from driving, but the love of the sport is still like a fire in his belly. When he spots a talented young driver he can&#39;t help remembering his own glory days. It&#39;s as if he is thirty years younger and racing the dirt tracks of Tennessee all over again. Jodell has an idea: his old friend and former &quot;wrench,&quot; Billy Winton, has put together a racing team, but so far wins have been hard to come by. Billy is looking for a driver who can do more than just chase the checkered flag. He needs a young gun who can tame the superspeedways and take the flag. A new partnership is born. But the Kid has a few obstacles in the way, namely Dale Earnhart, Jr., Adam Petty, Casey Atwood, and the other young guns who are clearly stock car racing&#39;s next wave of stars. It&#39;s a new generation of drivers, but the prize in &lt;i&gt;Young Guns&lt;/i&gt; is the same: the checkered flag!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
