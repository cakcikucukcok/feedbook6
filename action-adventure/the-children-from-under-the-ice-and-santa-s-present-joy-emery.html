  <title>The Children from Under the Ice and Santa’S Present - Joy Emery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Viridis 6000 dived from the sky and cut deep down through the icy waters at the North Pole and remained sub-merged in the Arctic Ocean covered with ice.  The visitors were no strangers to earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visitors had a mission to complete during their visit to Earth.  Many years ago they had relocated animals to Earth because their own world called Viridis was dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the journey to Earth, an unknown virus had struck down most of the older members of the crew.  However, the expedition had to continue on with the younger members including the children.  They, with their unique animal communication skills, would help complete the mis-sion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst monitoring the animals, they find them under attack from the Yapikus who had played a part in the eradication of many of the ani-mals on Viridis.  It soon became apparent to Captain Genesis and his crew, the troubles that lay ahead for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Testifying to the bonds between children and animals, this novel also highlights the real threat of animal extinction.  The Children take us through extraordinary and breathtaking adventures as they pursue their mission to protect the animals whilst remaining undetected by the media and governments of Earth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
