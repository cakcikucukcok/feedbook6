  <title>The Moon Shines For All - B.R. Keegstra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Her known world was shattered by a Soviet bullet. Only six years old, Terez was already learning about life&#39;s mean streaks. But being an orphan didn&#39;t stop her. At seventeen she was one of the youngest women in a 1960&#39;s Chicago medical school, where love, racism and loss were thrust upon her, creating a distaste for life in her adopted country. Fleeing to a clinic in rural Afghanistan, she embraces romance once more, only to have it stolen from her a second time, along with her son. Grief and guilt envelop her in a dark shroud and to emerge from this she must fight her own demons as well as the twin devils of war and terrorism. Teri&#39;s journey will resonate with anyone who has had to find resilience and fortitude to overcome obstacles in life and with anyone who is opposed to war and terrorism." />
