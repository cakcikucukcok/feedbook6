  <title>Road Trip Blues - Johann C.M. Laesecke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;August 1926 - September 1927&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;What Could Possibly Go Wrong?&amp;rdquo; Laure and Dan are posilutely sure the good times will roll as they plan and build their future together. Laure receives glowing reviews for her performance in &lt;em&gt;The Great Gatsby&lt;/em&gt; movie and the studio offers her roles in two movies with her Hollywood &amp;lsquo;sister&amp;rsquo; Louise Brooks. More good news arrives when Famous Players-Lasky Studio green-lights film production of their &lt;em&gt;Road Trip Blues&lt;/em&gt; movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of good times, storm clouds roll in. Laure is framed for murder and &lt;em&gt;Road Trip Blues&lt;/em&gt; movie production is disrupted. The sabotage escalates until a stuntman is killed and the studio halts production. Laure and Dan defend themselves from a series of attacks designed to ruin them personally but that&amp;rsquo;s just the first stage. The violence intensifies as the unknown villains turn to kidnapping and murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laure and Dan&amp;rsquo;s friends from &lt;em&gt;The Roaring Road&lt;/em&gt; return in &lt;em&gt;Road Trip Blues&lt;/em&gt; to use their talents of deception and trickery to identify and defeat the enemy. Giuseppe, a young man with mysterious connections to Capone&amp;rsquo;s Chicago South Side Outfit offers his help but Laure becomes suspicious when she discovers there is a rat in her crew sending information to their foe. Laure races across the country in their private train to track down the enemy and rescue Dan, who is hunted by a New Jersey mobster and three sadistic railroad cinderdicks. He escapes and learns to ride the rails with Moe and Joe, two fun loving hobos and over-the-hill stage actors who believe vaudeville will make a comeback. If it does, after a stunning and violent fight to the finish will Laure and Dan be there to see it?&lt;/p&gt;" />
