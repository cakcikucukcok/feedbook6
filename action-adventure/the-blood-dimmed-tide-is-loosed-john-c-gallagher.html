  <title>The Blood-Dimmed Tide Is Loosed - John C. Gallagher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Hugh and Phyllis Hannigan hear the horrific news that their daughter and son-in-law have been brutally murdered while on their honeymoon, they reach out to someone they know they can trust: one of their own. Mick Hannigan, their nephew and the director of security for a mining companyas well as a veteran and an occasional poor mans Bob Hopeagrees to travels to the tiny South American country of Talcayan to investigate the murders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There, he meets the typical mixture of the good and bad in a seemingly lawless place, where the usual restraints on the worst human impulses have broken down. Mick contributes his considerable combat skills to the struggle of some law-abiding citizens who are fighting the attempt by criminals to take control of the country. But even in victory, there is a price to pay; their small victories merely uncover new layers of intrigue and cruelty. Mick discovers that there is also a battle going on within himself. He struggles to escape the one entanglement he didnt expect to encounter in this foreign land: someone who actually likes him. Thats a quality he has always admired in an attractive female. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides, where else is he likely to find a woman who will come to the rescue of her friends with a
Leopard I tank and a ragtag army? &lt;/p&gt;" />
