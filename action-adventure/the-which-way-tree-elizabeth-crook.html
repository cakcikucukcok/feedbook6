  <title>The Which Way Tree - Elizabeth Crook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The poignant odyssey of a tenacious young girl who braves the dangers of the Texas frontier to avenge her mother&#39;s death.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Early one morning in the remote hill country of Texas, a panther savagely attacks a family of homesteaders, mauling a young girl named Samantha and killing her mother, whose final act is to save her daughter&#39;s life. Samantha and her half brother, Benjamin, survive, but she is left traumatized, her face horribly scarred. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Narrated in Benjamin&#39;s beguilingly plainspoken voice, &lt;i&gt;The Which Way Tree&lt;/i&gt; is the story of Samantha&#39;s unshakeable resolve to stalk and kill the infamous panther, rumored across the Rio Grande to be a demon, and avenge her mother&#39;s death. In their quest she and Benjamin, now orphaned, enlist a charismatic Tejano outlaw and a haunted, compassionate preacher with an aging but relentless tracking dog. As the members of this unlikely posse hunt the panther, they are in turn pursued by a hapless but sadistic Confederate soldier with troubled family ties to the preacher and a score to settle. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; In the tradition of the great pursuit narratives, &lt;i&gt;The Which Way Tree&lt;/i&gt; is a breathtaking saga of one steadfast girl&#39;s revenge against an implacable and unknowable beast. Yet with the comedic undertones of Benjamin&#39;s storytelling, it is also a timeless tale full of warmth and humor, and a testament to the enduring love that carries a sister and brother through a perilous adventure with all the dimensions of a legend. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;A ripping adventure [with] a show-stopping finale.&quot;-&lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;The stuff of legends.&quot;-Attica Locke &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Powerful, sly, and often charming.&quot;-Daniel Woodrell" />
