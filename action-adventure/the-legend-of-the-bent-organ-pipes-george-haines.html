  <title>The Legend of the Bent Organ Pipes - George Haines</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Deep inside the Organ Mountains located in New Mexico, a treasure of gold and silver has remained hidden for hundreds of years. A Spanish soldier divulged the location of this cache as he died in the arms of the local padre, who scribbled the information on a scrap of paper. 
This fragment of yellowed paper remained obscured, lodged between pages of a prayer book at a monastery over many decades. The elusive informationthe subject of enduring folklore, rumors, and gossipgradually became known as the Legend of the Bent Organ Pipes, a formation of vertical columns of granite in the Organ Mountains. 
Then, in the 1940s, this obscure paper is discovered by a German priest who is serving at the monastery. He requests that the information be inscribed on a pewter medallion and cut into five pieces to ensure secrecy. 
Alas, a former German Panzer Tank commander, Colonel Helmut Schmidt, alias Red Fox, and the nemesis of detectives Sam Hames and Howie Newbald, learns about the legend. Determined to be the first to find the treasure, he entices two of his former soldiers to assist him. He thinks the five separate pieces of the medallion may now be located in Indiana, but where exactly? 
Sheriff Neverfine, chief law officer in Gurant County, Indiana, becomes involved. He directs detectives, Sam and Howie, to investigate the legend and nab the crafty Red Fox. 
Who will be the first to locate the five pieces of the medallion, follow the directions, and find the treasure? You will have to read every chapter to find out." />
