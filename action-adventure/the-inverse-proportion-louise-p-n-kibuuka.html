  <title>The Inverse Proportion - Louise P.N. Kibuuka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Good Samaritan Centre was located secluded in a green village. The clients housed in there seemed to live there against their will. Little did they know, they were there for their own safety and well-being! They kept trying and turning the door locks to escape without success!
Outside the glass doors lay an open, beautiful garden designed and planted to offer solace, pleasure, and emotional therapy for the clients.
Far away from the guarded doors, they scramble for research and to cure the precious lives from the devastating disease that took the priority on each countrys development agenda.
In some countries, it was feared that senior citizens were at the edge of extinction. In other countries, it was a natural condition for the aged.
Meanwhile, every sixty-seven seconds, a new case appeared. One of her church friends had just been diagnosed and admitted to hospital for the same disease!
Justina felt she had a responsibility to contribute and help fight the menace!
The responsibility every carer dreads!" />
