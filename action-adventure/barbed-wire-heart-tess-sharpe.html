      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;This powerful debut thriller from &quot;a major new talent&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Kirkus&lt;/i&gt;) set in a poor, rural community where loyalty is everything, &quot;packs an emotional punch&quot; (Lisa Gardner) as the daughter of a meth kingpin is forced to choose between family, or freedom.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Never cut the drugs--leave them pure. &lt;br&gt;  Guns are meant to be shot--keep them loaded. &lt;br&gt;  Family is everything--betray them and die. &lt;br&gt;  Harley McKenna is the only child of North County&#39;s biggest criminal. Duke McKenna&#39;s run more guns, cooked more meth, and killed more men than anyone around. Harley&#39;s been working for him since she was sixteen, dreading the day he&#39;d deem her ready to rule the rural drug empire he&#39;s built. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Her time&#39;s run out. The Springfields, her family&#39;s biggest rivals, are moving in. And they&#39;re coming for Duke&#39;s only weak spot: his daughter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Duke&#39;s raised her to be deadly -- he never counted on her being disloyal. But if Harley wants to survive and protect the people she loves, she&#39;s got to take out both Duke&#39;s operation and the Springfields. Blowing up meth labs is dangerous business, and getting caught will be the end of her, but Harley has one advantage: She is her father&#39;s daughter. And McKennas always win." />
