  <title>The 13Th Apostle - Dan Danov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A prominent Swiss banker in Palm Beach finds his wife murdered and suspects a secret military operation. His determination to find out who is behind the killing throws the Swiss diplomatic and military establishment into panic. He has the knowledge to expose the biggest secret of all how the gold and artifacts stolen from Jews and deposited in secret bank accounts during WWII became the foundation for a worldwide investment scheme that became the pillar of the Swiss economic miracle. &lt;p&gt;
Max Hooker becomes involved in the case when the murder takes place at his door step. He stumbles on to a covert military operation and a mysterious &quot;13th Apostle&quot;. Max has to gain the confidence of a surviving Nazi organization as his search takes him to Germany, Paraguay and finally to Switzerland. His possession of secret bank records and the coinciding US Government negotiation with the Swiss banks on behalf of the surviving Holocaust victims allows him to recover some of the stolen loot. Max finds out who the real &quot;13th Apostle&quot; is and closes the circle of a dark human tragedy that originated in the last days of WWII and came to a close when the secret is revealed." />
