  <title>Known To The Police - Thomas Holmes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;The kind reception accorded to a previous book encourages me to believe that another volume dealing with my experiences in the great under-world of London may not prove unacceptable. For twenty-five years I have practically lived in this under-world, and the knowledge that I have obtained has been gathered from sad, and often wearying, experience. Yet I have seen so much to encourage and inspire me, that now, in my latter days, I am more hopeful of humanity&amp;#39;s ultimate good than ever. Hopeful&amp;mdash;nay, I am certain, for I have felt the pulse of humanity, and I know that it throbs with true sympathy. I have listened to its heart-beats, and I know that they tell in no uncertain manner that the heart of humanity is sound and true. Most gladly do I take this opportunity of proclaiming&amp;mdash;and I would that I could proclaim it with a far-reaching voice&amp;mdash;that, in spite of all appearances to the contrary, in spite of apparent carelessness, indifference, and selfishness, the rich are not unmindful of the poor; they do not hate the poor, for I know&amp;mdash;and no one knows it better&amp;mdash;that with many of the rich the present condition of the very poor is a matter of deep and almost heartbreaking concern. ...&amp;quot;" />
