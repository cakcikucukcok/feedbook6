  <title>Privacy Interrupted - Paulie J. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A young boy loses his twin brother at the age of ten, and two years later, he loses his mother to cancer. He overcomes a multitude of mental disorders that developed from having a photographic memory, and used his beliefs to be his guide in his life. He had problems talking to people so he withdrew to a life of seclusion.
  A judge intervened, and through the Judge, he met a Senator that recognized his capabilities, and a rocky relationship followed for the rest of their lives.
  Damage came to him when he saved a girl from death. He didnt have skills in being able to talk to people, and he had to fight a battle that he knew nothing about, it was a battle of love. The problem he had was the girl that he saved was the Senators daughter that he knew, but she didnt know him. His life was kept secret from her for a purpose.
  To complicate matters, he lived his life of seclusion in the mountains and worked his thoughts out by working on other projects that he had.
  The girl he saved was a prisoner of the weather, he couldnt help her back to safety, and he knew that him being around her would only cause her discomfort.
  She was injured and she required attention, which meant that he had to remain nearby. She didnt have anyone but the man that saved her life, so she was at his mercy, and he was at hers.
  Neither one of them expected what was to unfold." />
