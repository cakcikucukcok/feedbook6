  <title>Zandi&#39;s Treasure: the Pact - Nick T. Byrd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Zandi and her father, Ronald, have made a big move from their beloved Arlandale, Utah, to Page, Arizona, to start a new life.  A beautiful town on the banks of the Colorado River, Page promises to be a great adventure for both Zandi and Ronald. As they settle into their new house, they receive shocking news about someone from their past. Suddenly, the quiet life that they have been anticipating gets turned upside down, and they fear for Zandis safety.
At the same time, Zandi begins teaching music at Page High School. She knows from the first day that she has made the right decision; she loves the school and her students. Then, during their walk after school, Zandi and her father literally run into a jogger who is also the math teacher at Page High School.  He is the friend that she was hoping to find in Page, but will they come to mean more to each other?  Despite the change in location, she is still as determined as ever to find Montezumas gold.  Will she finally succeed in her quest?  
Join Zandi and her friends in final book in the &lt;i&gt;Zandis Treasure&lt;/i&gt; series, &lt;i&gt;The Pact&lt;/i&gt;!" />
