  <title>The Letter and the Hit List - Anushka Arvind</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sonia is twenty years old and alone in the world. Her parents died in a mysterious bombing accident, and shes been living with her aunt and uncle ever since. When things suddenly go awry, the truth comes out: Sonias parents death was no accident. They were set up, and they left a very important list for their little girl.
Sonias aunt and uncle flee with their family, because Sonia is now set on a dangerous mission. Her parents left her a list of people she has to kill in order to avenge them and stay alive. She is prepared for this undertaking, but she is shocked to discover her high school crush is part of the plan, as well. She must train him to become a killer, too.
Slowly, Sonia forms a talented team. She travels all over India in search of villains on her parents hit list. Relationships form between team members, as do suspicions. After all, can killers really trust each other? There are ten targets and one team. Will they catch and kill the traitors, or will something go horribly awry, just like the murder of Sonias parents?" />
