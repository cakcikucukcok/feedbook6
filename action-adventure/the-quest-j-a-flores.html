  <title>The Quest - J.A. Flores</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During the Kuberican Dark War Sir Kain Viccon, 113th Grand General of the Kingdom of Arcainia faced down the horrid monster known as Noknor. With the defeat of the vile warlock, Kain rescued his beautiful Chinese cousin Hua Li from the clutches of evil, avenged the murder of his parents and a thousand other wronged souls, and saved the very world from the Scourge of Darkness. Through hardships and bravery peace was finally restored to the Old World. But it could not last.
Two years have now passed and trouble is once again brewing, this time on two fronts. In the Old World, the newly crowned queen of the Kingdom of Shazadia has launched a savage sneak attack on a weaker kingdom, enraging the other four kingdoms of the Old World including the powerful lionness that is Arcainia. While Kain has his hands full trying to stop a seemingly inevitable war from breaking out, Li is called before the mystical Chinese Council of Dragons to investigate an unnatural disturbance in the Chinese Witch Mountains, the site of their epic battle with a terrible and ancient evil.
Old friends will reunite, new friendships made, and disturbing prophecies shall be revealed in the exciting continuation of this true faerytale filled with romance, sword-swinging adventure, and martial arts action!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
