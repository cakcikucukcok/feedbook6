  <title>Jim - Ronald Lee Weagley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Weagley tells tales of times past. Academic degrees, business experiences, a military career, a devoted wife, and four wonderful children mix with his imagination to produce saga segues rooted in truth and faith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of Dr. Weagleys stories are published and available: SEASCAPE, TRIBE ARPEGGIOS, WALLACE, and JED, each uniquely portraying justice and hope for the foolish, oppressed, and downtrodden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JIM is a continuation of Dr. Weagleys efforts to appreciate those who unnecessarily suffer hardships in life, as if voice for the silenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim, an innocent 20th century protagonist, bounced against fates door, repeatedly. A loving family accidentally abandoned him while an infant barely capable of walking without a stagger. Rogue Apache rescued him from his plight in the 1890 Nebraska tall grass. His rescuers ushered a long march toward perdition salved by Grace administered by the Great Spirit. Jim avoided death, converted precarious situations into opportunities, and stood ultimately before a merciful God in order to receive a deserved blessing for a job well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time and circumstance met patience and faith in Jims life, allowing Dr. Weagley to release his latent desire to tell character stories of the strong, gallant, diligent, and the fabled survivors who thrived in the face of distinct adversities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good and evil still reside side-by-side and only the dreamer can speculate with wonders that capture truth in the shadow shade of a Saving Grace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
