  <title>Sisters Without Mercy Ii: the Sheikh - Clarence J. Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After thirty years, Brigadier General Carolyn McKenzie Marshall is retiring and leaving the US Army behind. Shes proud of her accomplishments, especially the formation and training of the first womens jump program in the army. Though looking forward to a new life in Hawaii, shes sad to leave her sisters behind, including her replacement, Col. Dora Aimsley. The two have been through a lot together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But just three days into retirement, one of Carries past exploits comes back to haunt her and her fellow sisters. Ten years ago, the Sheikh managed to escape destruction when Dora blew up the building in which he and his cohorts were hiding. Now, the Sheikh has returned to exact revenge on Dora and the team who caused him to lose money and face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sheikh means business. Even so, Dora foils his hijacking attempt on the Popes airplane, and the Sheikh retaliates by kidnapping Doras twin daughters and Carrie. Doras training kicks in and with the help of her fellow sisters tries to save her friend, her family, and herself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
