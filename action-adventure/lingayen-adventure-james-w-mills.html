  <title>Lingayen Adventure - James W. Mills</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Late 1941 Philippine Islands
Just before Manila fell to the Japanese, a large bank sent out a crew to bury its gold reserves in the wilds of Lingayen.
On the return trip the bank employees were strafed by a single Jap plane. Everyone was killed and with their demise, the gold location was lost.
Almost four years later, an American forward observer found a cave that had been opened by an errant artillery shell. Upon entering the cave, he found the gold buried in 1941 .He first considered turning in this treasure, then decided to try and keep it for himself. He first drew a detailed map of the area, then called for one more strike to seal the entrance.
This map eventually came into the hands of a millionaire industrialist, Carlyle Thomas, who outfitted a ship to visit the Philippine Islands and bring back the gold. To captain this expedition, he chose Jerry Wilson. ,a young hell for leather ex-Navy skipper.
Jerrys exploits as he fights a Pacific typhoon, a treacherous band of Huks, not to mention all of the beautiful women in his life (particularly Nikki) make for exciting reading." />
