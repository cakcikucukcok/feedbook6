  <title>The Sterling Connection - Liam Adair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a boy, Paul Blair, from New York is granted a scholarship to an exclusive boarding school in England, he has no inkling of the future contribution he will make to humanity.
He is befriended by another boarder, a Knight of the Realm. Even though they are from two different ends of the social spectrum, their friendship takes them into adulthood.
Blair became a member of the US Special Forces and worked with the UN. His friend Sir Charles Spencer had taken to a life of crime. He used his construction company and position in society as a front to build a criminal empire and multibillion dollar fortune.
The struggle between these two will take them from England to Africa, the Middle East, and the USA. Spencer decided the quickest way to make money was to plunder third-world countries of their mineral wealth. It is Blair who brings him to stand before the International Court of Justice in the Hague to answer for those crimes.
The outcome will be tragic for one of them." />
