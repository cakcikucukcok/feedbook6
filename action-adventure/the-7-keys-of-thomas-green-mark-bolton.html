  <title>The 7 Keys of Thomas Green - Mark Bolton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When his friend Albert died leaving him a very special key, Thomas Green realized his life was to change from the mundane trudge of a poor existence, to a complete plethora of adventures.  What would it be like to have the ability to travel from one world to another? To just disappear without a trace, to live adventures beyond your imagination. Thomas Green an ordinary man can do all this and more with the help of a key he obtained purely by chance.  There is a catch however, There are seven keys and if Thomas fails to find the remaining six held in amazing worlds parallel to this one. Thomas will come to the same fate that befell his dear friend Albert.
Can he find the keys in time? Embroiled in the mystery of his own mortality he has to understand what it is to be mortal. The cultures, beliefs and dangers of the creatures he meets during his travels introduce him to more and more adventure. A journey beyond all that is real. 
The key of Enof lies through a portal that only the key Thomas holds can open. He must retrieve the key of Enof. But so many perils lay in his path. The help from a small grabbit gnome named Stalta begins to make his journey easier. But when a selfish twist of fate rears its ugly head things become so much more difficult. However a prophecy brings help from a warrior breed that have tried to fight an evil ruling their land for an age. The Seeker is their Prophecy and to them Thomas is the Seeker." />
