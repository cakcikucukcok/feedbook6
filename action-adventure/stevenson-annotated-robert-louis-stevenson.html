  <title>Stevenson (Annotated) - Robert Louis Stevenson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Robert Louis Stevenson (13 November 1850 &amp;ndash; 3 December 1894) was a literary celebrity in his lifetime and remains one of the most translated authors in the world (Currently ranked #26). He was a novelist, poet and a prolific travel writer in an age when moving across nations was arduous and fraught with peril. Stevenson lived his short life to the full. Of the cocaine-fueled writing binge that produced Strange Case of Jekyll and Hyde, his wife Fanny said: &amp;#39;That an invalid in my husband&amp;#39;s condition of health should have been able to perform the manual labor alone of putting 60,000 words on paper in six days, seems almost incredible.&amp;#39;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No Robert Louis Stevenson collection would be complete without Treasure Island, another genre kick-starter which, partly thanks to Disney, remains alive in the public&amp;rsquo;s imagination; and Kidnapped, Stevenson&amp;rsquo;s famous &amp;ldquo;boy&amp;rsquo;s&amp;rdquo; novel. There is also The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Two Roses, a lesser known historical romance adventure set during England&amp;rsquo;s Wars of the Roses, and An Inland Voyage, a pioneering work of travel literature by Stevenson about a canoeing trip through France and Belgium in 1876.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This collection includes an image gallery with portraits of Stevenson, photographs from his last years in Samoa, copies of first edition book covers and reproductions of many original Victorian illustrations.&lt;br /&gt;
