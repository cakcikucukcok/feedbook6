  <title>A Brother Knows - Fernando S. Aranda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In A Brother Knows, a young boy named Alejandro mysteriously vanished without a trace from a small town in Mexico. He had been taken by a Mexican drug lord for punishment of the boys father having stolen funds from him. Alejandro is taken to the United States and brainwashed to believe he is Alex and has a new family and leads a new life. His older brother Eduardo knew that his Alejandro was alive somewhere and would not give up until he would find him.
Years passed and Alejandro was nowhere to be found until one day they crossed paths in the United Stated and started a friendship. Eduardo was certain Alex was his younger brother who had vanished. However, Alex had forgotten all about his prior life and did not recall having a brother. Eduardo knew in his heart this was his brother and would do everything in his power to find out for certain and get him back to his mother who was waiting for him back in Mexico. 
Eduardos determination to find out if Alex is his long lost brother pushes him to seek help from an old friend and possibly put everyone he loves in danger, including his found brother. His plan to get his brother back involves getting even with the people who brainwashed his brother and the Mexican drug lord who started it all. Things dont go as planned and takes a twist when Alex finally realizes hes not who he is and the drug lord finds out about his plot to take revenge. However, it was Eduardos devotion to his brother and getting him back to his mother at any cost that determines their fate." />
