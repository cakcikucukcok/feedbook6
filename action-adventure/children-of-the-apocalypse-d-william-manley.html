  <title>Children of the Apocalypse - D. William Manley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most of us in this world live a survivable, if not comfortable and secure life.  But what if our secure, comfortable civilization were swept away in a moment of unimaginable violence and horror, along with ninety percent of the earth&#39;s population and we found ourselves living in another one of history&#39;s darkest moments? Would we be able to muster the same tenacity, creativity and determination that motivated our ancestors to survive and continue?
  Children of the Apocalypse is a story about an event that hasn&#39;t yet happened, but could at any moment. The threat of Nuclear War has lived in our darkest fears and imaginings since the world first witnessed the cataclysmic destruction and desolation that these weapons can bring.
   This story pits a retired soldier, four neighborhood teenagers and a few new friends against an unimaginable environment. The world has become a place where mobs of radiation victims roam and plunder mindlessly, where the sun brings death rather than life, and the preserved food, left over from before Dooms Day, is running out fast. 
   The little group struggles to survive for a day, for a week and then a month, and will soon be challenged to grow food in a poisoned world without sunlight. 
   Civilization is seriously threatened and the world is about to become the most hostile savage and uncivilized place in all history. 
   With each challenge this little group become stronger, more confident and better prepared for the next. Will they be ready for the environmental upheaval that the earth is about to go through in the Nuclear Winter? Do they dare to believe in the future enough to make plans,fall in love and have families? 
   Will Mankind find a way to continue?" />
