  <title>Lukewarm - Orin Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1951, on the outer lukewarm edges of the Cold War, Stanley Warren becomes a PsyWar operative in the just-organized CIA. He is sent to Greece to organize a Black Radio station, calling for resistance inside communist Bulgaria.  His close friend John Preston directs covert missions in Albania.  Their adventures and failures teach them what can and cannotwin in the U.S./Soviet battle for third-world peoples.  And that freedom and democracy cant be imposed. They must be earned and accepted by the citizens of any country.  
LUKEWARM is an adventure  novel. Set in the 1950s, it pulls the reader into a time when CIAs primitive covert operations wasted resources and often seriously damaged Americas reputation.  The incidents are now history and LUKEWARM has received clearance from CIA. 
*	*	*
Now  retired in Oceanside, CA, Orin Parker had an early first career with the CIA.  Following that he worked as executive of an educational services organization, serving in the Middle East area for over twenty years.  His two earlier novels are centered on the Palestinian problem: BURIAL IN BEIRUT in 1998 and RAJAOUN - WE WILL RETURN in 2000.  Both are available at Barnes &amp; Noble, IUniverse.com, and Amazon.com.
