  <title>The Leprechauns and the Magic Horse - Robert Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Josh, king of Ulster held a feast in Armagh. King Leon, king of Leprechaun land held a feast at the same time. Leon was six and a half inches tall, half an inch taller than the rest of his people. He boasted and said. Have you ever seen a king superior to me? They all said they had not but David hearing such boasting laughed out loud. The king stopped choking with rage. Why do you laugh? he said, because I know of one province in Ireland and if one of them cam alone here tonight he could take from you and your people all your wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David was arrested but said to the king as a result of the hands placed on me here tonight you will be forced to spend one year in Armagh and you will not leave it until you have left the best of your wealth and jewels behind with the Ulster king. Misfortune will befall because I will be kept in the house of Josh the Daring. I will swim in a goblet of wine and be almost drowned. Give me three days and three nights and I will go to Armagh and if I do not bring back proof you can do with me what you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David goes to Armagh and returns with Aodh a dwarf in Ulster but a giant in Leprechaun land. King Leon has to spend a year in Ulster and the leprechauns declare war on Ulster to get him back. They dry up the wells, dry out the cattle so they have no milk and cut the ears off the heads of corn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A magic horse coloured yellow. with purple legs transports Leon, the Leprechaun KIng and his queen Anna. He can travel on land, sea, and and and can arrive before he departs. The horse extends by the number of people on his back.&lt;/p&gt;" />
