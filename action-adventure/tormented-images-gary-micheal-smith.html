  <title>Tormented Images - Gary Micheal Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alex Danford is the most successful artist of the twentieth century. His storybook life ends tragically with the mysterious disappearance of his wife and daughter. After three years of emptiness, existing as a binge-drinking recluse in a villa in St. Thomas, Alex decides to abandon his efforts to complete the paintings for his upcoming Tormented Images gallery exhibition and return to New York City to find the truth. 
&lt;p&gt;Frederick Winston is an aging, egocentric billionaire working on the architectural piece-de-resistance of his illustrious career. Winston Center will be the culmination of a life-long dream, to be constructed in New York City. One thing, however, is standing in Winston&#39;s way: cancer. Winston learns that he has mere months to live. Desperate to stay alive long enough to fulfil his dream, he agrees to purchase a very expensive miracle cure from a very unscrupulous, secret oragnization. 
&lt;p&gt;Both men quickly become caught up in a tangled web of secrets, espionage and danger as they race against time in their personal struggles to uncover the truth behind their life and death situations. The fast moving story is a blend of action, mystery and interwoven plot twists and turns." />
