  <title>Islam&#39;s Fire - Joseph M. Pujals</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A frantic phone call from the president of World Bank jars Carl Lukin and Ann Curlin out of a restful vacation on the Hood Canal in Washington State. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been stolen from the bank, and the bank president wants to hire Lukin Investigations to find the money before the news gets out, causing the bank to collapse. 
As Carl and Ann follow the money, they realize that the theft is connected to a body Carl had discovered in the Hood Canal. The money trail leads to the terrifying realization that it has been stolen to finance an international terrorist organization called Islams Fire. Carls first allegiance is to the bank, but he feels compelled to notify the CIA of the terrorist connection. Before they can be stopped, the terrorists attack the power grid on the West Coast, blacking out more than half the country. 
Working with both the FBI and the CIA, Carl and Ann track the leaders of Islams Fire around the world. Before they can stop them, though, they manage to wreak havoc, causing death and destruction all across the country. Murder, terror, bombings, and personal tragedy all force Carl to face the unthinkable in his urgent quest to stop &lt;i&gt;Islams Fire.&lt;/i&gt;" />
