  <title>The Old West Adventures of Ornery and Slim - Montana Kid Hammer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Trail Never Ends, Montana Kid Hammers third novel in his series, trails Ornery and Slim into another set of high adventures; escapades that grow out of the very frontier that holds them fast. Ornery, a Civil War survivor turned veteran cowhand, and Slim, a young orphan from Philadelphia and a burgeoning cowman in his own right, partner up to ride for the brand handled simply as the O U T (Oh-Ewe-Tee) Spread.
Their third season of cow crafting finds this pair in the company of, or referenced to, such historic old west personages as, Wyatt Earp, Teddy Blue Abbott, Crazy Horse, and Teddy Roosevelt. Ornery, Slim, and the other hands of the outfit experience such calamities as encounters with rustlers, prairie storms, unsavory saloon types, sheep wars, cantankerous US Army personnel, and wonderful womanly wiles that up the ante of their challenges and try both soul and gun hand.
Kids Old West series is intended to rekindle fond recollections of Old West evenings sat around campfires to a passel of never before told bone rattling and hair-raising cowman tales. Offered is a unique opportunity to ride back to those wild and wooly days of Americas western yesteryears." />
