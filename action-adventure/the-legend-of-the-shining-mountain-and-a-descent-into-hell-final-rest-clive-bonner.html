&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;&quot;Legend of the Shining Mountain and A Descent into Hell: Final Rest&quot; are two stories set in the 1960s. In each story, the characters are affected by incidents relating to the Viet Nam War that lead to a once-in-a-lifetime adventure and deep bonds of family and friendship. &lt;br /&gt;In &quot;Legend,&quot; after their father is killed in action, two sisters, in hopes of saving the family ranch from foreclosure find an old faded sheet of paper in their miner Grandfather&#39;s diary. The paper states, &#39;Go into the mountain&#39;s tusk wherein lies a river of golden sand.&#39; In desperate hope to save the ranch the sisters wander into the wilderness in search of fortune. Will the sisters find this legendary gold deposit in time, or is it merely a campfire tale? &lt;br /&gt;In &quot;A Descent into Hell: Final Rest,&quot; Frank Gallagher, a mysterious Vietnam War pilot currently on leave seeks the help of outdoor enthusiast, Ed Bradford to search for a long-forgotten mountain-cave. The cave, known as &#39;The Chimney&#39; to the bygone Native Americans, can only be accessed in early winter. If temperatures rise while they are in the cave, it will mean imminent death for the explorers, and yet Frank is willing to take the risk.&lt;/div&gt;
