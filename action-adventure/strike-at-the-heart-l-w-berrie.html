  <title>Strike at the Heart - L.W. Berrie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="SYNOPSIS FOR - STRIKE AT THE HEART - THE RESCUE MISSION
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Colonel John Harris, U.S. Army Special Forces, goes back in time to retrieve the men he left behind - especially Captain Jerome Roundtree, his Lakota Sioux blood-brother. He must retrieve or replace Nomis handmaids by order of Mutwa, the tribal shaman. But someone or something is preventing them from getting past Mount Kenya. Some blame it on the ghost of Harriss adversary, Mhalglami. Some blame it on the land gone wild. Either way he must get everyone to the extraction point IF he is to see Nomi again in this world.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Usa, born of the rape of her Teri mother by a Masai warrior, longs for a world where her mixed heritage does not matter. Although promised from childhood to NGrundbligimi, their marriage is blocked after the murders of her parents. She longs for a world where she can be free to pursue her dreams. But does such a world exist?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
NGrundbligimi, almost beheaded as a boy, grows to become the Teri War Chief and protector of the Kings cattle. Although forbidden to marry Usa by powerful forces from both within and outside the tribe, he is determined to follow her to a world where they can be free to marry - even if it means his life.

&lt;b&gt;Judges Comments From London Book festival 2007 (Winner of the Genre Based Category):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I found the premise intriguing and the writing crisp. This old-fashion page-turner that sucks you in.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I definitely feel like I want to see the movie. The author has obviously traveled a bit and has a good eye for scene-setting and plot development. Its not easy to do and involved plot like this, but the author carries it out w/ aplomb.&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Judges Comments From Hollywood Book Fair 2006 (Honorable Mention in General Fiction Category):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Film worthy, and definitely worth checking out. A page-turning read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I enjoyed this from start to finish. What a vivid imagination.
