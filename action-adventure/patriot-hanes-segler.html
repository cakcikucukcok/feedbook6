      <meta name="description" content="Never before in history has the population of a country suffered more than during the Mexican Revolution. For over a decade, the poor of that country carried on a struggle against the government, the rich landowners and even the Catholic Church.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Benito, a young man wishing to become a true revolutionary patriot, joins the forces of Pancho Villa, only to find that his duties make him little more than a horse thief! When he is saved from a government death squad by wealthy Mexican-American rancher Alejandro Guerra, he decides to change his occupation, using his skills with livestock to repay his newfound benefactor.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;However, Benito soon learns, along with Guerra, that &lt;i&gt;La Revolucin&lt;/I&gt; is bent on drawing everything and everyone into the bloody conflict. Along the way, both men find the war&#39;s treacherous combatants and ever-shifting alliances will shape life-and death-for years to come.&lt;/P&gt;" />
