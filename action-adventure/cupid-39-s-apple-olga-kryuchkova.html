  <title>Cupid&#39;s Apple - Olga Kryuchkova</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sergei Lvovich Zavyalov, an artillery major, takes a holiday to visit his aunt Aglaya Dmitrievna. At his aunt’s insistence, Zavyalov begins courting their neighbour, Polina Veresova. They have a night of love in a hunting lodge. Polina’s intimate diary falls into the man’s hands. Sergei Lvovich is shocked and immediately leaves the love nest. He leaves the welcome home of his aunt Aglaya Dmitrievna without further explanation and goes to visit a friend. The upset aunt gathers a basket of apples for her nephew’s journey.&lt;br/&gt;
Zavyalov boards a train and finds himself in a carriage with a teenage boy and his English tutor. The major has no idea that this is to become a fateful encounter for him. Meanwhile, in provocation the teenager takes an apple from Zavyalov’s basket without asking. In response, the young troublemaker receives a hefty slap from the major. A scandal erupts.&lt;br/&gt;
At this point, Polina realises that Sergei has run away. She decides to go after him and explain herself no matter what the cost.  Zavyalov gets safely to his army friend Sobolev’s estate. Soon enough, Polina arrives and gets a room at a nearby inn.&lt;br/&gt;
Sobolev and Zavyalov go off hunting. They find a poacher on Sobolev’s grounds. Zavyalov recognises him as the Englishman from the train. Meanwhile, Polina is spying on Zavyalov and gets caught in the rain. She decides to hide in a small barn next to Sobolev’s estate. By the will of destiny, the Englishman happens to be wandering in that direction...&lt;br/&gt;" />
