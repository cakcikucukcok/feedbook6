      <meta name="description" content="The Valdier, Sarafin, and Curizan Lords had children who just cannot stop getting into trouble! There is nothing as cute or funny as magical, shapeshifting kids, and nothing as heartwarming as family.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A little magic can go a long way....&lt;br /&gt;

A campfire tale while on a camp-out with their dads has the dragonlings and their besties enchanted with a mythical kingdom called Glitter, home of the magical and mischievous Great King Leprechaun and the Little People. When the younglings discover their dads have disappeared, they are certain King Leprechaun is responsible. Armed with a magic four-leaf clover, the dragonlings and their besties will do anything to save their fathers, including tricking the King by using their golden symbiots&amp;mdash;because everyone knows a Leprechaun can&amp;rsquo;t resist gold!&lt;br /&gt;

Internationally acclaimed S.E. Smith presents a new action-packed story full of mischief and adventure. Brimming with her signature humor, vivid landscapes, and beloved characters, this book is sure to be another fan favorite!&lt;br /&gt;
