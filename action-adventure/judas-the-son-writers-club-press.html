  <title>Judas, the Son - Writers Club Press</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Judas Thomas was conceived during a brutal rape. His mother, a nun, keeps the child and gives birth to a mulatto boy. To the horror of the parish, she names the boy Judas, after the ill-fated disciple Judas Iscariot. Despised for his name and mulatto race, Judas is raised in a Catholic orphanage. Judas grows up to a powerful prosecuting attorney. He cuts no deals and prosecutes criminals with ruthless vengeance. Judas gains powerful friends including the newly elected Governor. When Judas&#39; plan to strengthen the Governor&#39;s resolve on capital offenses fails, Judas finds himself in jail. Hoping to rebuild his life after prison, Judas discovers new life in his son. When his son is diagnosed with leukemia, Judas makes the ultimate bargain with God: his life for his son&#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;
Despised for his name and mulatto race, Judas is raised in a Catholic orphanage. Judas becomes a powerful prosecuting attorney specializing in sexual assault. He prosecutes criminals with ruthless vengeance. Judas gains powerful friends including the newly elected Governor. When Judas&#39; plan to strengthen the Governor&#39;s resolve on sexual assault fails, Judas finds new life in his son. Judas will make the ultimate bargain with God: &lt;i&gt;his&lt;/i&gt; life for his son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poetic and powerful, Mac Enulty challenges the long-standing tradition of the world&#39;s most infamous betrayer through the eyes of a young black orphan. This is the story of one man&#39;s struggle with biblical and racial prejudice, damnation and redemption, Heaven and Hell. Suspenseful and harrowing, E.W. Mac Enulty II debuts a magnificent novel of spiritual passion, human longing and the indomitable courage of one man to persevere.&lt;/p&gt;" />
