  <title>The Path To Betrayal - Phillip J Tucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Can a small group of men change history? Since the dawn of modern warfare, small groups of trained soldiers equipped with the right equipment, and more importantly &#39;Intelligence&#39; have carried out missions that have led to major victories and crushing defeats. This is the story of one of those units.  Steve Roberts is a young man with the same aims and hopes of many young men just starting out in life. His gift is that he&#39;s a good soldier, who excels at his profession. Approached by the Americans to join a special unit, to help counter their enemies  around the world, Steve enters a world where friend and foe become unrecognisable from each other.  Along with Ali, his unit commander from the Shah of Iran&#39;s elite guard, Cody a paratrooper from Scotland, Aaron a French commando, and Sukai a Japanese marine, Steve finds himself pulled down the road from a naive youth to a ruthless killer. Forced to fight for their very lives against all who would do them harm, Steve learns, that sometimes your greatest love, is the one thing that makes you vulnerable." />
