  <title>Revenge in Twin Valleys - Odell Sexton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They can run and hide but can never escape the rath of a woman and a man together out to seek revenge.  The combination of Ann and Jeff&#39;s skills make them the perfect killing machine, it was kill or be killed.  There would be no mercy on either side.  Along the way, they rescued 11 beautiful young women who were brought into the valley as sex slaves for the Black Widow&#39;s gang of killers and outlaws.  The women also wanted revenge.  In this secret valley, the two teach the women how to kill their enemy.  When it was time to come out and kill they were dressed all in black.  They didn&#39;t have to worry about killing innocent people since there were none in the valley.   Come hell or high water, all would have their revenge." />
