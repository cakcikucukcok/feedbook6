  <title>When Otters Play - Mara Purl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are sea otters as cute and clever as they seem? Miranda Jones is as captivated by their sweet faces as she is spellbound by their antics. She can hardly wait to interact with them on her kayaking expedition off California&amp;rsquo;s Central Coast. Yet nothing could be more surprising than the controversy they&amp;rsquo;ve caused in the sun-drenched Santa Barbara waters, nor more disturbing than the vehement hatred they seem to inspire among local fishermen. Are the otters really as adorable as they seem? Or is there more at stake . . . When Otters Play?&lt;br /&gt;
Though the e-book stands alone, it also introduces Book 3of the Milford-Haven Novels, the critically acclaimed, popular series, a multi-generational saga. Based on Purl&amp;rsquo;s BBC Radio drama Milford-Haven U.S.A.&lt;/p&gt;" />
