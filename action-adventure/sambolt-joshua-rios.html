  <title>Sambolt - Joshua  Rios</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sambolt is a totally unique adventure story where you will read of life and sacrifice. Dive into the wilderness of Sonochi, where Sambolt, an orphaned rabbit, lives with his tribe upon a great hill. It is such a beautiful and ideal place that his tribe risks much to maintain their lives and the lives of their loved ones whenever predators come hunting in the territory. When Sambolt is confronted with a chance to help save his brothers, he takes it, and is chased into the surrounding forest by two hungry coyotes. He survives, but not without having the greater part of his left ear bitten off, a permanent reminder of how unforgiving the world can be. He eludes the coyotes deep into the wilderness, further from home than he has ever been. In the forest, he is found by another young rabbit named Siindy, who introduces Sambolt to her own tribe. Meanwhile Sambolt&#39;s family back on the hill faces new challenges from an evil rabbit. In the forest, Sambolt is introduced to a lifestyle that is very different than what he was used to back home. The rabbits in the forest wonder if he is from the fabled land of their ancestors. Will Sambolt ever make it back home?" />
