  <title>The Black Shadow - Teddy Sabutey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="BY THE GRACE OF JEHOVAH GOD SINCE THE
DEATH OF HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON, Jesus Christ,
every thousand years, a child is born to save humanity from
hidden dangers of the evil one, as well as revealing Gods
nature of grace to humankind. So, providence befell on the Attah-
Keshei`s family of Ada, in Ghana, when Kofi was born.
He became an American citizen and then a unique and notorious member
of the elite unit of the Security Network of the USA, simply known as
the A10, which has a constant membership of just ten people with given
powers equal and above that of even the president of the USA.
Kofi , who was nicknamed The Black Shadow, was tasked to unravel
criminal killings, assassinations of presidents, prominent leaders
 business, social, religious, and political  across the globe, and,
particularly, family members of the The Blackwell Empire whose
business empire controls most of the world socio-economic and
political stage.
This led to the shocking revelation of the true double identity of one
man who cunningly managed his way through the rank and fi le of
the American intelligence and political hierarchy to become the vice
president of the United States of America, Nick Adams, known to the
underworld as The Saint, whilst he sell death and anything to the
highest bidder, until he fi nd out that he was an illegitimate son of the
founder of the Blackwell empire, and hell broke loss as he assassinated,
every hire to the Blackwell throne, and intended to marry off his only
son to Helena Blackwell, in order to control the empire, so any man
who express interest in Helena Blackwell is killed, until Kofi , surfaced,
not just a an antidote to the saint, but lover of Helena Blackwell." />
