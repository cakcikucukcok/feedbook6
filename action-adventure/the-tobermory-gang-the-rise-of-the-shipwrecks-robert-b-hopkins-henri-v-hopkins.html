  <title>THE TOBERMORY GANG: The Rise of the Shipwrecks - Robert B Hopkins, Henri V Hopkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Three new friends who attend a summer camp for sick kids become involved in the battle between a small town and an angry sea monster. Each of the kids must use their special skills to come together to save the town. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;(Excerpts) Instead of easing into his new position, he jerked as the dark object reappeared and rammed into his dock making him throw his cup of coffee in the air, and then the thing was gone. &amp;hellip;When he was closer to where the dock was hit, he noticed a big black streak with something orangey and smelly on the edge. He knew he had seen something, but never the likes of this. What could it be? And then he heard a noise &amp;ldquo;Wooooshshshsaaaa.&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip;The bright yellow school bus rumbled up Highway 6 being filled with trouble makers, 20 pre-adolescent kids who are away from their parents, many for the first time, 2 camp counsellors and 1 sympathetic bus driver... So far, the kid&amp;rsquo;s lives had been difficult. All 20 of them, like others before every summer, were allowed to go to the free camp, if they qualified as living with a long term sickness &amp;hellip; The kids had not yet won the lottery of an easy life, but they had the lottery of being selected to go to camp this summer, which was a small victory and any victory provided hope. &amp;hellip;The bus driver, Clayton, smiled. &amp;ldquo;One day they will surprise you, maybe save the world, or even you.&amp;rdquo; &amp;hellip;The captain (of the ferry) made a rare public address announcement. &amp;ldquo;Your attention please. This is the captain speaking. It appears that we have made a collision with some unknown object in the water&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
