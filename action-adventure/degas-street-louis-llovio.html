  <title>Degas Street - Louis Llovio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Clearwater, Florida a tropical paradise where sunshine is a way of life. A beach town where families come to live out their vacation dreams on the sandy beaches of Florida&#39;s West Coast. But there&#39;s a teeming underbelly to this idyllic postcard-friendly town-an underbelly they fight for you not to see. For Clearwater is a place where drugs, prostitution and murder are a way of life, just like any town in America. It is not supposed to happen here, but it does-every day.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;Paul Easterman, a reporter whose once brilliant career has passed him by, is hiding from a past he can do nothing about. Rebecca Madison, a fifteen-year-old prostitute whose never had a chance in her wretched life, is trying to survive one more night. Thrown together by circumstances beyond their control, they must find a way to stay alive, save her from a life on the streets and redeem their shattered dreams. To do this they must fight the FBI, a sadistic hit man, a pimp hell bent on running the streets his way and each other.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But first-they have to survive Degas Street." />
