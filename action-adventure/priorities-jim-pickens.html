  <title>Priorities - Jim Pickens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This novel is about the fundamental changes that took place in the lives of Will, Bill, and Jackie, in less than a year, while Deweys priority, his oil company, will never change
While at home for his mothers funeral, Will Thomas, a petroleum engineer, watches the BP oil well in the Gulf fail, causing the government to shut down all drilling in the Gulf. Will discovers a possible oil field under his fathers 700 acre citrus farm. If Dewey Carlson, Wills boss, can recover this oil, his company can survive. Otherwise, Carlson Oil will be bankrupt, and Will and his colleagues will lose their jobs.
When Will goes to the bank, he meets the most beautiful women hes ever seen, and falls madly in love. He decides hes not leaving her to wait for him to return from some project on the other side of the world. Those days are over, even if it means giving up his career and becoming a citrus farmer with his dad.
Bill Thomas, seeing his sons after his wife dies, realizes how much he has missed being with his sons and grandchildren, makes his top priorities the relationship with his family and their happiness, and the new members, Jackie and her daughter, Angie, that will be part of the family when Will gets married.
Dewey Carlson still is obsessed with finding which politicians and bureaucrats to bribe for drilling permits, getting around roadblocks put in his way by environmentalists against all drilling, and older locals who dont want any changes in their town. His only priority is his company." />
