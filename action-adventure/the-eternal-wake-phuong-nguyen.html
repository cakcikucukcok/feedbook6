  <title>The Eternal Wake - Phuong Nguyen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book accompanied the readers along the journey of a young girl named Evelyn. Evelyn spent her twenty years confined in a basement isolated from the world. Her crimes she did not know, nor did she knew of her family. Her journey began when she found the portal to a different dimension, a dimension that trained half her soul to fight a force she never knew. This force, known as the Cavaliers, consists of dead souls who wanders the earth due to certain attachment whether it is money, power, addiction, or love. The only way these souls can be release is to collect living souls to complete their cycle. However, under the ruling of King Charis&#39; lineage, the Gods forbade these Cavaliers from hunting within the protection of King Charis&#39; supremacy. The only way to rid of a Cavalier is through qi (chi), a natural force that flows through the universe in which can be wielded into a weapon. Evelyn&#39;s journey to find the truth about herself was accompanied by Flynn, her partner in crime. Their journey develops a passion between the two, a secretive passion that neither one dares to admit. Conflict arouse when a Cavalier stumbled upon her path and confessed his attachment to her, the only reason why he could not receive his judgment day. Evelyn was left to debate upon her feelings for Flynn and this Cavalier, who had loved her unconditionally even through a millenia. She also found her reason for existence in which she now must decide whether to save her own world or the world of the basement in which lays half her soul - a world she never truly knew." />
