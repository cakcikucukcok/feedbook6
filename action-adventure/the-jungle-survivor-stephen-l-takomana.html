  <title>The Jungle Survivor - Stephen L Takomana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this book, the author sets out places and scenes that relates to the environment and places as would be ideal for the period when Malawi then Nyasaland was with very low population density and a total population of about three million people. As such, some scenes relate to periods before and immediately after the countrys independence and Republic; and closely relate to the areas the author visited and or lived.
Written as his spare time hobby, this book is based on fiction from the authors imagination based on some real sites in the country and relates to some real life occurrences in the days when the country had fascinating jungles and forests full of wild animals, beautiful birds and reptiles. Some scenes are based on places that are nonexistent, but would in real life be possible to have existed elsewhere in this country. Time and again, the author delves into the Railway world from where the scenes of the then Nyasaland Railway inevitably come into focus; but blends them with both existing and nonexistent Railway stations and sidings to draw away the reader from associating the story with anyone living or dead. Some scenes also delve into periods when Malawi Railways was in operation.
In setting out this book, the author aims at capturing the mind of the readers and the learners in English, who might find this book useful for expanding their vocabulary. With such settings, the book is intended to incite amusement and laughter that will in the end maintain the attention of the reader to continue reading to the very end. In some cases, the author has deliberately used vocabulary that would be difficult for some beginners in English. However, this vindicates one of its purposes; to entice the reader not to flounder, but use the dictionary for expansion into the world of vocabulary. 
Zizwa and other names used in this book are all fictitious names that bear no relation to anyone living or dead. Again the author does, nowhere in the book, write about his experiences as the environment of his growth in mission places set out in the passage above, bears no relation to the settings in the stories in this book." />
