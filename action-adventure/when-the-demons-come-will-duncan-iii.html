  <title>When the Demons Come - Will Duncan Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Adam Shaw had everything: A pretty wife, three smart kids, a great job, a big house. There was just one problem: he liked to drink. A lot.&lt;p&gt;
Piece by piece, his secure world disintegrates. By the time he has lost everything that gave meaning to his life it is too late.&lt;p&gt;
In his struggle to regain his life Adam must solve the devil&#39;s own dilemma: he finds he cannot trust the only organization that can help him back to sanity.&lt;p&gt; 
Adam&#39;s death-struggle infects everyone around him: Gordon, the mysterious stranger who becomes his closest friend; Jackie, the compassionate woman who shows him the way back, and then leaves him; Scott, the young scientist who saves his life at sea; and Leslie, the beautiful nurse with whom he falls in love, but who refuses to accept him until he can sober up.&lt;p&gt;
Follow Adam into the abyss, and then back up into the sunlight. You won&#39;t be able to set this book down." />
