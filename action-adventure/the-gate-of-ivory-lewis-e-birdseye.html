  <title>The Gate of Ivory - Lewis E. Birdseye</title>
      <meta name="description" content="GATE OF IVORY is a novel  part one of a two volume series, the second work called GATE OF HORN  that could easily appear in tomorrows New York Times as a front-page news story. It deals with events we read about every day and watch talking heads spout plumes of verbiage nightly concerning the losing battle current governments all over the world are fighting against the pernicious appeal of dangerous and illicit drugs and the pervasive presence and growing power of demagogic right-wing idealogues who mask their plans for complete control of business and government and the citizenry with New Speak rhetoric about freedom and liberty. It presents the reader as well with a small group of people who are unwittingly and unwillingly brought face to face with these potentially catastrophic situations and made to realize that their actions alone may be all that can return the world to sanity and at least a measure of safety. For the characters in the novels theirs is an epic struggle, the means at their disposal no more than intelligence, courage, and the realization that they have no choice but to act, and act well. Their task is clearly beyond their ability. But they act nevertheless and in their actions tell the reader a little about life lived with value and excellence at its center." />
