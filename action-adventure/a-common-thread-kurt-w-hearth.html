  <title>A Common Thread - Kurt W. Hearth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At one time, they were a professional, tough, and efficient teamelite covert troopers who accomplished those assignments no one else would dirty their hands withor would even admit to having any knowledge of. Even though theyre retired now, they still have each others back, especially when one of their own faces trouble. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Father Joe OReilly, the teams self-appointed chaplain, would give his life in a New York minute to help someone in need. That has placed him in a situation that may cost him his life. He is assigned to a small cluster of islands in the Caribbean Sea called the Isles of Eden and directed to help the islanders any way he can. But Dr. Enrico Hamadryad has other plans. He is the leader of the Gifted, a criminal cult located on the Isles of Eden that rejects all laws and faith and makes their own. Its goal is world domination. Whats more, the natives have fallen under Hamadryads evil spell, and OReilly is kidnapped. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His former teammates, led by John Hawk, must find a way to rescue OReilly before he is killed, and they aim to put an end to Hamadryad and his evil cult along the way." />
