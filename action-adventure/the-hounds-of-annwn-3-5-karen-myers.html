  <title>The Hounds of Annwn 3-5 - Karen Myers</title>

Gwyn ap Nudd, Prince of Annwn, has plans to secure his domain in the new world from the overbearing interference of his father Lludd, the King of Britain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The security of George&#39;s family is bound to that of his overlord, and he vows to help.

Other gods and gods-to-be have taken an interest, but the fae are divided in their allegiances and fear the threat of deadly new powers in their unchanging lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George and his companions must save themselves if they are to persuade their potential allies to help. But how can they do so, attacked on so many fronts at once? Will he put his family into greater jeopardy by trying to defend them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bound into the Blood &lt;/strong&gt;– Book 4 of &lt;strong&gt;The Hounds of Annwn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DISTURBING THE FAMILY SECRETS COULD BRING RUIN TO EVERYTHING HE’S WORKED SO HARD TO BUILD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;George Talbot Traherne, the human huntsman for the Wild Hunt, is preparing for the birth of his child by exploring the family papers about his parents and their deaths. When his improved relationship with his patron, the antlered god Cernunnos, is jeopardized by an unexpected opposition, he finds he must choose between loyalty to family and loyalty to a god.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He discovers he doesn&#39;t know either of them as well as he thought. His search for answers takes him to the human world with unsuitable companions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How will he keep a rock-wight safe from detection, or even teach her the rules of the road? And what will he awaken in the process, bringing disaster back to his family on his own doorstep?
