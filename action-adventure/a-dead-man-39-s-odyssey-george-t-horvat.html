  <title>A Dead Man&#39;s Odyssey - George T. Horvat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This story is about a man who had finally reached the end of his rope with the Christian assault on his soul. It was an assault that came at him from all directions, burying him in theological contradictions. By this time in his life, he had given up on his faith and decided to walk away and let the chips fall where they may. He would lead his life one day at a time, and to hell with who was right and who was wrong. It wasnt going to be a pleasant experience coming his way in this middle world that he suddenly found himself in, but it would wind up being a turning point in his lifea turning point that would bring him back into the fold, for the Shepherd is a jealous caretaker and dreads the loss of a single member of his flock. All of his issues would not be resolved, but the events happening in this place beyond the grave would ultimately strengthen his faith and would serve as his shield against further attacks from the adversary. Follow him on his journey as he finds himself stranded somewhere between heaven and hell." />
