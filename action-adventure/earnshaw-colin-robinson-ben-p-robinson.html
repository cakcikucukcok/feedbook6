  <title>Earnshaw - Colin Robinson, Ben P Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Earnshaw, the Tiger Tabby Kitten, was born into dereliction and deprivation in Salford; cast into the dark, oily waters of the Docks by a vicious Human but rescued by a kindly passer-by. Confined to a shelter for unwanted Cats, the ante-room for euthanasia, he is rescued once more, adopted by a family and settled in a house on the edge of the Lake District. The countryside was like another world. A Rabbit, Scruffy Parrot and Black Kitten are added to the household; together they need to embark on a steep learning curve of survival. Earnshaw realises that they can understand Human communication but not the reverse; however, natural cleverness and invention solves this and many other problems, creating misunderstandings and humour along the way in their parallel world as seen through the eyes of Earnshaw When the world of the Tiger Tabby and his Friends is invaded by a group of cruel, vicious Humans; survival requires teamwork, ingenuity, cunning and a determination to fight and win. They become a formidable team with help from other Animals, Birds - and a few Humans. They win the unconventional battle after many adventures, gaining confidence in their own abilities of being able to match and outwit Humans, creating their own brand of humour and gallimaufry on the way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
