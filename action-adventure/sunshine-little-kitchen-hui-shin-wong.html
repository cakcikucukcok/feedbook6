  <title>Sunshine Little Kitchen - Hui-Shin Wong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sunshine Little Kitchen is a compendium of ten travel tales of Wong Hui Shin in 365 days over ten years, where she writes about her wrestle with communication or the lack thereof. There is no such thing as miscommunication. The fact is, ideas and thoughts are filtered and broken down due to popular perception. Coupled with the nuances of the human mind that perceive every situation as colorful as a kaleidoscope. She believes that everyone can dream and everything is possible. The world-wind story begins with three adventurous musketeers bound for Thailand (2001). The author continues her solo journey Fogg-style to experience firsthand heritage preservation and environment protection with Korea National Commission for UNESCO in South Korea (2002), train-hopping through Japan using Japan Rail Pass (2003) and the Peace of Voyage of Maldives (2004). In year 2005, she has announced herself as Nefertiti in Egypt, transformed a mission impossible to a Clairvoyant Reservoir, awestruck by the legendary blue light of the Great Lake Erie and travelled around America, searching for aliens and lost Malaysians using US Rail Pass. In Year 2009, she has a train adventure from Chennai to New Delhi for a connecting flight to London, where she spent her first real Valentines in Hanwell Community Observatory, United Kingdom, after finally solving the problem of miscommunication by a five-minute video session in Berlin, Germany, a couple of years before she met great Malaysians for culture and food exploration in Newcastle Upon Type, United Kingdom." />
