  <title>Planet Treasure Guardians : Secret of the Stolen Scripts - S.V. Bodle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="UNPREDICTABLE ADVENTURES will fascinate and delight you.
Outwit formidable foes and gain miraculous powers as you dive deep into the mystery and danger of this nail-biting series. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A crippling poison has left Ladeks body in a life-threatening coma. Trapped in mental darkness, he fears for his friends and worries about the danger they will face.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Racing against time, Ladek must learn to manipulate energy and harness the power of his special senses. Only then can he discover the location of the stolen scripts which hold a secret so powerful that the Tanyaksa will stop at nothing to capture them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Robbie must escape the lethal inhabitants of Elquinra and unlock the power of his sun gem to save Ladeks life. But he has bigger problems when a freak accident knocks Skyla off her feet and she absorbs a near-fatal dose of ability-altering energy. Attempting to help her, Robbie unwittingly makes the situation far worse when his actions threaten to jeopardize the quest.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Absorbing powers which make her stronger than ever, Mrs. Scryvun casts a mental illusion over Ladek to ensure her access to the highly guarded and most central core of the quests defence. With the jelp of a battle-hardened combatant, she is posed to gain power over all human life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As the Planet Treasure Guardians discover a hidden room, blast into outer space and uncover dangerous plots at the highest level of government, their friendship grows stronger still and the quest becomes even more fraught with danger. They will need to draw on all their resources to overcome powerful enemies, but can they hold on to the Stolen Scripts  and save Ladek too?" />
