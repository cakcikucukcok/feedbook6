  <title>The Fifth Journal - Matt Sims</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Fifth Journal is a fictional story that takes place in the not so distant, and very possible future.  Being the first addition to a proposed series of six books, The Fifth Journal sets in motion a multidimensional timeline involving one family and one world conflict. The primary location of the story is in Northern California, however, it could have been anywhere given the possibilities presented in this scenario.  
The Fifth Journal is primarily one mans personal story of his encounters during the initial stages of this fictional World War Three conflict.  The story he tells is one of personal heroism, sacrifice, and ultimately, internal growth from an array of climactic situations he is faced with during his time on the road trying to get home.  Through most of his story his perspective is that of a man feeling alone and out numbered; with no one being there to help him in his time of need.  The real development takes place when James, the main character, takes a mental step back and realizes that there is more to this life other than his own pain and supposed suffering.  
If you have enjoyed in the past movies like Red Dawn, I am Legend, War of the Worlds, and TV shows like Doomsday Preppers and Breaking Bad, I encourage you to take a chance with The Fifth Journal.  If you havent seen and enjoyed Movies and TV such as the ones mentioned before, then get out there and try them out having first given The Fifth Journal a try.  
When reading The Fifth Journal, keep in mind it is the first installment in a series of six books.  A lot of the questions you may have, while reading, will most definitely be answered in the coming years as more and more of this story comes to fruition.  In the mean time, however, I implore and challenge you to read this story and not in some way relate to at least one, if not many, of the main characters personal struggles.  
This is a life we all live together that should never be taken for granted.  Follow along with James as he learns a few lessons that maybe you already have in your own travels, and perhaps, a few others that you may not yet have even considered." />
