  <title>Snare of the Fowler - Tom Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Suspense and terror in the air above the Gran Chaco of Paraguay.
&lt;P&gt;For missionary pilot Paul Graham, the accidental death of his young son has led to bitter conflict with his wife and with his God.  Now, as he flies a critically injured Indian to the hospital, he faces a low fuel supply and a storm front boiling in the sky across his flight path.  Graham must decide if he will risk his plane and passengers by flying through the storm, or should he divert to a safe airfield - and let the Indian die.
&lt;P&gt;But Graham is in no mental or spiritual condition to make such a decision.  He desperately needs guidance, but he has pushed God far away...
&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;SNARE OF THE FOWLER&lt;/I&gt; was first published in 1977 by Moody Press of Chicago.  This edition has been updated and revised by the author." />
