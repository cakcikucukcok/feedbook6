&lt;p&gt;The Smuggler&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Black Jade is many things. Hiding behind a prominent name by day and a Chinese mask by night, he can be anyonejust not the man he wants to be. Trapped in an ever-tightening web of deceit and pursued relentlessly by the White Dragon, he must choose which man he wants to be. When a way out is offered from a surprising source, will he choose power or let it go?&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Spy&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A Spanish officer, a black market dealer, a shipping executive, an intelligence officerPhilip Montero is skilled at wearing masks to defeat the enemy, but this time he must face the enemy within. Plagued by nightmares, he must unlock his past in order to survive. Time is running out, though, and Black Jade has targeted the woman of his heart. Betrayed by his family, his former fiance, and his fears, who can teach him how to trust again?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Senorita&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shipping-heiress-turned-missionary-nurse Francesca McRae is a target everywhere she turns. Desired as an heiress by power-hungry men and hated by the Chinese Boxers for her interference in the culture, she is surrounded by deception and hatred. None of her suitors are who they seem, yet one has stolen her heart. When loving others becomes more than she can handle, who can she trust?&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Where do you turn when life is too much to handle?&lt;/p&gt;" />
