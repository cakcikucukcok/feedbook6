  <title>Tough Money - Rikki Fortune</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bridget Money has always dreamt of being a famed chef in her own fancy, cosmopolitan restaurant. But after a series of setbacks, she finds herself back in her hometown of Hideout Bay, where she conjures a plan to get back on her feet once and for all. She gets a job with the largest and most stable employer in town: the men&#39;s state prison. She is hired as a Supervising Correctional Cook, but she won&#39;t be hosting any highbrow parties behind bars. In fact, this place is for the worst of the worst of the California penal system. Bridget never expected to find love at her new job, but when she meets handsome C.O. Dade Louis, she can&#39;t help but appreciate his good looks and charm. Between maintaining control over inmates and steering clear of corrupt prison employees, being strong isn&#39;t just a job requirement-it&#39;s the only thing keeping Bridget alive. Will she let Dade into her heart or will her tough exterior make her a prisoner of loneliness?" />
