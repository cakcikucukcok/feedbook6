  <title>McKettrick&#39;s Pride (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (McKettrick Men, Book 2) - Linda Lael Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;The only wide-open space Rance McKettrick wants to see in his future is his hometown in his rear-view mirror. The down-to-earth ex-rancher is determined to make a fresh start with his two young daughters – and leave his heart-breaking loss and family&#39;s successful corporation far behind.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He sure doesn&#39;t need Indian Rock&#39;s free-spirited new bookstore owner Echo Wells confusing his choices – and raising memories he&#39;d rather forget.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But her straightforward honesty and reluctance to trust is challenging everything Rance thought he knew about himself.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And when their irresistible attraction puts their hearts on the line, Rance and Echo must come to grips with who they really are to find a once-in-a-lifetime happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
