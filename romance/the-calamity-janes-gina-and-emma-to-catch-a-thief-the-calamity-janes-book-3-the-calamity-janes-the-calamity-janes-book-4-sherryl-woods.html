        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;#1 New York Times bestselling author Sherryl Woods returns with two enthralling tales of the Calamity Janes…fierce friends facing challenges in life and love &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To Catch a Thief&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gina Petrillo thought she was on the run from her troubles…but they followed her home to Winding River, Wyoming. City-slicker lawyer Rafe O&#39;Donnell is in hot pursuit of Gina, and he doesn&#39;t intend to let his suspect out of his sight, even though Gina&#39;s mouthwatering kisses are irresistible. And while Rafe is out to catch a thief–she just might steal his heart!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Calamity Janes&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Struggling with single-motherhood and career pressures, Denver attorney Emma Rogers comes home for a reunion with the Calamity Janes in desperate need of their support. Can they–and her young daughter–possibly be right that sexy journalist Ford Hamilton, the biggest thorn in her side, is actually the answer to her prayers?&lt;/p&gt;
