  <title>So Wicked - Melissa Marino</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Between the deliciously dirty and tattooed Marshall to the tasty treats within its pages, So Wicked left me hungry for more.&quot; -- Brighton Walsh, author of Caged in Winter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;Melissa&#39;s books are unique and masterful, filled with brutal emotions and unstoppable hope. A definite must read for anyone who loves sensual and smart romance.&quot; -- Ellis Leigh, USA Today bestselling author&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Fate has a wicked sense of humor.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Alexis&#39;s new life was made up of two things: baking and hiding the details of her old life in Chicago. The first allowed her to finally find some happiness. And the second is about to be destroyed by a man who knows all her secrets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Marshall Rawlins was prepared to do anything when he moved cross-country to launch an upscale cocktail bar---anything except work with Alexis, his best friend and business partner&#39;s ex-wife. Adding Alexis&#39;s boozy-baked goods to his menu would be a major feat for his bar. But striking a deal means getting in bed with the enemy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Battling between distrust and desire, Alexis and Marshall give in to a passionate, forbidden affair. They know if they&#39;re discovered the consequences would be bad---it&#39;s just hard to remember that when being together feels so, so good.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Praise for Melissa Marino:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;  &quot;I was totally blown away.... It was one of those rare reads that has everything I love in a book: a spitfire heroine, a swoon worthy hero, a captivating plot, and an unforgettable love story. Marino&#39;s ability to transcribe emotions left me spellbound. She has a reader for life!&quot; -- Tara Sue Me, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author of the Submissive series on &lt;i&gt;So Twisted.&lt;/i&gt;" />
