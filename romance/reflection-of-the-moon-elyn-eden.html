  <title>Reflection of the Moon - Elyn Eden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The passion Ellie feels for Thomas is all consuming. When they make love she experiences a profound transcendence as if she is touching the heart of life itself. There is only one problem: Thomas does not exist. He lives only in haunting dreams in which they meet near a mysterious hillside where a giant man is outlined in white stone. She experiences great joy in her relationship with Thomas but is plunged into grief when he is murdered.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;More perplexing is another man Ellie dreams of, an enigmatic monk. He stands by a beautiful stained glass window in an ancient church looking at her with infinity in his eyes. In his presence, she feels uplifted.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Eventually, Ellie realises she is not dreaming but rather remembering fragments of an intriguing former life lived in a village in Victorian England. Feeling that these memories are highly significant and desperate to know more, she travels there. It soon becomes apparent something very strange is going on in the village and she has been drawn there for a purpose she never could have imagined, one with&amp;nbsp;the power to radically transform her life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
