  <title>The Hot Spot - Niobia Bryant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For one newly single lady, it&#39;s time to make things hot.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Zaria Ali married her high school sweetheart, she jumped straight into adulthood. But twenty-one years later, her husband has left her for a younger woman, her kids are in college-and Zaria is looking to make up for lost time. Who says she can&#39;t be living la vida loca in her forties?  And who says she can&#39;t date hot twenty-six-year-old Kaleb Strong?.  .  . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kaleb may be young, but he&#39;s mature-and ready to settle down with the right woman. Zaria lightens up his serious side-and turns him on like no one ever has. But is there more between them than just explosive chemistry? The only way to find out is to follow his heart, and show Zaria that when it comes to love, age is nothing but a number.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Hot men, spicy women and a sexually captivating story.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;Hot Like Fire &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Very impressive.&quot; -Cydney Rax, author of &lt;i&gt;Brothers &amp;amp; Wives &lt;/i&gt;" />
