        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Meet the Mitchell brothers of Fool&#39;s Gold, California—five gorgeous men who&#39;ve left a trail of broken hearts in their wake…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maya Farlow learned the hard way to depend only on herself, so when she fell too deeply for the bad-boy charms of Del Mitchell, she did the only thing she could—she ran. Stunned, Del left Fool&#39;s Gold to make his name and fortune in extreme sports.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now ten years later, Maya&#39;s been hired to promote her hometown&#39;s new slogan, The Destination for Romance. The celebrity spokesman is none other than Del, the man she dumped but never forgot. Awkward!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although Del&#39;s not the type to hold a grudge, he&#39;s determined to avoid falling a second time for the woman who broke his heart. He&#39;s a daredevil, not an idiot. Trouble is, in all his adventures, he never found a rush as exhilarating as Maya&#39;s kiss. Maybe risking his heart will prove to be the biggest thrill of all…&lt;/p&gt;
