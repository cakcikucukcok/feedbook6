  <title>Duel - Amneris Di Cesare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="That evening Stefania was not in the right mood when, to please her friend Manuela, she goes to a party where she doesn’t know anyone. She is certainly not feeling ready to fall in love again. But when Davide, the one having the party, entered her life to the music of Duel by Propaganda, without asking her permission, Stefania didn’t know how to react. Because what she feels for Tony, an educated man who gave her Wuthering Heights and left her without giving a reason, is still so overpowering that she is unable to accept turning the page and welcoming a different, but deeper feeling. The love between Stefania and Davide will be a battle that they will fought to the last, destroying each other, because sometimes Love is a Duel that is always in equilibrium between passion and jealousy, trust and disbelief. And Stefania will find that she has to choose whether to follow her destiny to the soundtrack of a thrilling summer song or the book plot that marked the beginning of a passion that is not entirely finished. And maybe, who knows, an unusual ending and a new song will await her around the corner.&lt;br/&gt;" />
