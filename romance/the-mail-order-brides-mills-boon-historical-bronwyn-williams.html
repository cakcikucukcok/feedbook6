          &lt;strong&gt;St. Bride Needed A Wife&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But the latest candidate was much too pretty to live amid a bunch of sailors on his desolate island. Ever since he&#39;d first set eyes on fragile beauty Dora Sutton, something had gone wrong with his careful plan. The women he&#39;d found for his men weren&#39;t working out, his books were a mess and Miss Sutton wasn&#39;t paying any attention to his orders.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Dora Needed A New Beginning&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But the insufferable Grey St. Bride refused to make it easy for her! From the moment she&#39;d staggered off the boat, it was clear the handsome brute wanted her gone. But much more was at stake for Dora than wounded pride…. If Mr. High-and-Mighty St. Bride didn&#39;t want her, she&#39;d just have to find someone else on the island who did!&lt;/p&gt;
