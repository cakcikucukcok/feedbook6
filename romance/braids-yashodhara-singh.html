  <title>Braids - Yashodhara Singh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Braids is a novel, somewhere between fictional romance, and a tale untold. A book dedicated to old-fashioned romance of yesteryears in todays day and age, was a challenge in itself. The completion of this book has been a journey; an endeavour to show how people can control their actions, even if the situation is beyond their reach. 
It is my hope that you, dear Reader, experience the book as you read it. As a fellow human who feels, thinks, believes, hopes. I believe everything begins and ends with the mind. Once it reaches the heart, it just stays. Hope Braids touches a chord with you too; for, to reach you, this is the only path I can pave. Enjoy what you hold. Enjoy what you have. 
Love, 
Yashodhara Singh." />
