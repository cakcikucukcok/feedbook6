  <title>In the Shade of a Shadow of Reason - Verna Lee Hutton-Ely</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Lucy Cavanagh has experienced periods of missing time since her childhood. They have estranged her from her friends and family, who are unable to cope with things out of the ordinary and who refuse to believe her explanations that she does not know what is happening to her. Once she shares her secret, even the people in the Christian churches she has attended end up judging her as insane, or worse, demon-possessed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; It is not until she finds herself in a meadow totally unaware of how she has gotten thereand comes face to face with a handsome stranger who claims to believe herthat she finds the love and acceptance she has been longing for. But this man has secrets of his own, secrets that she is unwilling to believe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Can love conquer disbelief? A mixture of fate and fantasy pushes the boundaries of Lucys faith  until she questions her own sanity. &lt;/p&gt;" />
