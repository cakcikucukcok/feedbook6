  <title>A New Orleans Threesome - Louisa Bacio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Haunted by paranormal abilities she can&#39;t control and plagued by nightmares about a demon that seeks her soul, Lily Anima travels to New Orleans in search of salvation. She enlists the help of an unlikely couple: a vampire, Lawrence Justice, and a werewolf, Trevor Pack. The attraction is immediate and fierce.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There&#39;s only one problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lily&#39;s a virgin. And whatever paranormal problem she&#39;s having is what has kept her that way. Every time she&#39;s tried to do the deed, something stops her.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Together, the trio encounters magic and unspeakable evil, and Trevor and Lawrence attempt to help Lily turn her powers into a gift rather than a curse. Ultimately, to get the demon off her back, Lily&#39;s men will have to show her all the wicked ways the three of them can come together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Warning: Read at your own risk. This book is filled to the brim with steamy m/m sex, a virgin who wants in on the action, and a c*ckblocking demon. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
