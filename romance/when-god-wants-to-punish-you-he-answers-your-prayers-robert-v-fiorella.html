style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Tom marries Jenny.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Tom and Jenny should live happily ever
after--.but life intervenes.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Tom gets
burned, tries to deny his soul, and loses his way.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Then Jenny, the love of his life, leaves him
to share a bed with Satan, and Toms world falls apart.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;He decides to focus all his time and energy
on fixing his life and getting Jenny back.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;To accomplish this daunting task Tom stops talking and withdraws into
himself where he feels certain he can find the answers hes looking for.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;To get away from outside distractions and
well meaning kith and kin he enters a cushy psychiatric center.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;While in this upscale Booby Hatch Tom finds
himself drawn into the lives of his fellow loons.&lt;span
style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;As he works through his problems Tom
rediscovers a part of himself that he thought he had buried a long time
ago.&lt;span style=&#39;mso-spacerun:yes&#39;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;He realizes that hes been the
unwitting master of his own destruction, and he undergoes a kind of rebirth
that puts him in touch with his nature. Tom learns that sometimes, when God
wants to punish you He answers your prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
