  <title>One Thousand and One Nights - Ruth Browne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sheri spends her days fighting zombies and her nights chained to a wall, earning her every breath by telling stories to her captor Aleksy-stories that make them both forget the ruined world. Sheri could put up with the conditions-at least she knows her sister is safe in the community Aleksy leads-until she realizes she&#39;s falling for him...even though he wants her dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Aleksy allowed Sheri and her sister into his compound, he didn&#39;t know about the zombie bite on her back. It&#39;s only a matter of time before she turns into one of the rising dead and threatens their existence, but Aleksy has a secret need for Sheri and her stories. For everyone&#39;s safety, he chains her to his bedroom wall, hoping for just one more day. But how long will the community allow Aleksy to ignore his own rule: always kill the infected. Always.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Previously released on Entangled&#39;s Ever After imprint - September 2013&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
