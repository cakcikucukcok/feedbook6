  <title>Cowboy With A Secret (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Pamela Browning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Bethany Burke was intrigued by her new ranch hand–a man she&#39;d ordered from a catalog! Strong, quiet Colt McClure had a way with animals and a past he never spoke of. The mystery only deepened when a baby girl arrived on the ranch doorstep–addressed to Colt!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Colt&#39;s lovely boss made him want to reveal his secret past–especially because Bethany thought he was the baby&#39;s father! True, the cowboy had a few closely guarded secrets, but being somebody&#39;s daddy wasn&#39;t one of them. The wrangler was desperate to reveal the truth–but baring his soul could mean losing his heart.&lt;/p&gt;
