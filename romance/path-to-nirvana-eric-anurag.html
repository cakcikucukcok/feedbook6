As Rahul builds a life for himself with his new wife, Julie, Tom stumbles into a massive gambling debt with crime lords and international terrorists operating out of Las Vegas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toms dealings rope the unwitting Rahul into the fray, and soon the two find themselves involved in a deadly car chase. Following the crash that ends the chase, Rahul wakes, confused about why everyone seems to want to call him Tom. Slowly, he pieces together he has been reincarnated into Toms body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is now faced with the difficult task of convincing everyone in his life he is in fact Rahul. Most resistant of all is his wife, Julie. As much as she loved her husband, her deep hatred of Tom wont allow her to care for the man now wearing his face. Even worse, Rahuls second chance at life comes with more lethal side effectsbecause even Toms many enemies believe he is Tom.&lt;/p&gt;" />
