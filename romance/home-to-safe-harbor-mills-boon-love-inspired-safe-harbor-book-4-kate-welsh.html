  <title>Home to Safe Harbor (Mills &amp; Boon Love Inspired) (Safe Harbor, Book 4) - Kate Welsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Reverend Justine Clemens returns to the town where she spent her rebellious youth, determined to prove herself. And to make her flock the family she never had. But God clearly has other ideas for her. First He limits the scope of her ministry. Then He brings her head-to-head with Chief Matthew Trent and his three daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Being with Matthew reawakens Justine&#39; s long-buried desire to have her own family. But she&#39; s forced to make some hard choices when the Safe Harbor gossips start talking behind her back. Will God give Justine the courage to stop listening to all the voices around her… and listen to her heart?&lt;/p&gt;
