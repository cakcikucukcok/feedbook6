  <title>A Small Flirtation - Buff Brazy Given</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;TJ, Guy and I gathered around the table on the terrace. The two of them just looked at me. I began by bursting into tears. They were dumbfounded. It was such an uncharacteristic thing for me to do. So much for being composed.&lt;P&gt;While you pull yourself together, dear one, Guy said, you might begin by facing the reality of your daily life head-on this time. OK?&lt;P&gt;I dont know! I blurted. What I do know is Im jealous of the time Paul spends with her, Kathyhis wife! That remark came from my very soul. I know its crazy, but its the Gods honest truth. I am also disgusted with me. At the same time, I feel taken for granted, and its demeaning. Its all too idiotic. I hate being in this position! I was furious. My inability to control my tears only made me moreangry.&lt;P&gt;I jumped up from the table and started pacing.&lt;P&gt;	Its no good to berate yourself at this point, Jenny. You took some chances, risked little and had a lot of fun. The only problem is the two of you blundered right smack into the Law of Unintended Consequences.&lt;P&gt;The what? TJ looked quizzical.&lt;P&gt;The Law of Unintended Consequences, Guy repeated.&lt;P&gt;Meaning? Oh, I get itwe fell in love.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Jenny Matthews [single] and Paul Crowley [married] met by chance at OHare airport in Chicago. They were both travelling home to San Francisco.&lt;P&gt;	A SMALL FLIRTATION is the poignant love story of two people each torn by life who had reached a point of seeming contentment. Buoyed by professional successes and personal friendships both strong and enduring, they had made peace with their lives. That is, until they met.&lt;/P&gt;" />
