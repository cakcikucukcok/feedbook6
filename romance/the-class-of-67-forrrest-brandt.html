    classmates live through turbulent social upheavalthe free speech movement; the struggle for civil rights, open housing, and access to the pill; the
    space race, and the threat of nuclear war. Jerry and his friends struggle to incorporate the changes, while dealing with their own identities,
    relationships, commitments, and expectations  all played out on a college campus.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    The reader will discover  or relive  what it was like to be in the epicenter of a storm of generation-splitting conflicts  including the threat of the
    military draft and the freedom of sex, drugs and rock n roll.

    What was the boomer generations reaction to mandatory military training, to girls hours and PDA (Public Display of Affection)? What did they think and
    feel during the Cuban missile crisis? Where were they on the day John F. Kennedy was shot? What did white suburban kids do when they discovered how rental
    housing worked, or racial tensions flared? How did couples obtain an abortion before Roe vs. Wade?
    &lt;br/&gt;
