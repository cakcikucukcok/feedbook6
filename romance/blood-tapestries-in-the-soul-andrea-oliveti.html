  <title>Blood Tapestries in the Soul - Andrea Oliveti </title>
      <meta name="description" content="Giacomo Rinaldi is a brilliant man, an Art lover that sees his life vanishing with the slow inflexibility of a river flowing in a distant landscape.&lt;br /&gt;
He loses his wife Barbara, his former wife, his friends and the ones he loved the most and he finds himself opposite his life turning point before starting a slow fall into the hell of his restless soul.&lt;br /&gt;
He might give up, leave his loved and sometimes distant God, let days pass in the same way, in an everlasting present made up of insignificant useless things without joy; or he might find the strength to struggle and the pleasure of living again, enjoy the sunset and the company and the comfort of that moon which is the protagonist of the novel in its immutable passion.&lt;br /&gt;
Through the most famous social networking site he meets Lara Capitani, a very beautiful and seemingly fragile woman and his life flourishes again: in her skin smelling of peach, in her fine hair like silk and honey he sees a clear sky after a storm and a new thought comes to him in a flash.&lt;br /&gt;
A toast in the moonlight, a gaze of passionate empathy, a walk hand in hand and that mosaic that had fallen apart almost magically comes back to its original shape as in the most valuable paintings. Giacomo goes beyond his past life and nothing seems to be precluded to him: his future is a tapestry of which he can decide its colours and weaving, death is a distant mystery, neither feared nor desired.&lt;br /&gt;
At this point the moon is deeply in his soul and its reflections will be sometimes sweet, other times strong and violent but they will indissolubly belong to him: finally he is the master of his life and this time, after a long time, after so many doubts and so much suffering he will not let it go any longer and he will lead his life towards a future all to be discovered or maybe it is already written in the eyes of that adorable smart woman that celebrated for him the everlasting and unfathomable Rite of Love..." />
