  <title>Michael D&#39;angelo: - G.W Blair</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Having travelled extensively, beginning at age fourteen, G. W. Blair enjoys reading about locations, domestic and foreign, where she has visited. With that in mind, and with the belief that others share that same enjoyment, G. W. has incorporated a few of those locals in her first mystery attempt Michael DAngelo: The Making of a Detective.
Her main character, Michael DAngelo, finds himself fresh off a banana boat docked in New Orleans, Louisiana. How he got there, and why, takes him into heretofore unchartered territories. How he gets into and out of trouble along the way in his quest for answers will change his life and, finally, his career path. 
After having solved his own mystery, DAngelo decides he is cut out for sleuthing and opens his own detective agency, which might prove to be interesting, to say the least." />
