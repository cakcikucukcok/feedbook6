Only she doesn&#39;t just need a guy in a suit-she needs a bodyguard. The only problem is that Jackson Grayson is big and gorgeous and &lt;i&gt;way&lt;/i&gt; too sexy. So much so that Scarlett&#39;s tempted to let this hot bad boy ruin her oh-so-good reputation...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jackson doesn&#39;t do relationships and he certainly doesn&#39;t sleep with clients. Yet he can&#39;t fight their inconvenient attraction, or how badly he wants Scarlett&#39;s warm and wicked curves against his body. He wants her. &lt;i&gt;Now&lt;/i&gt;. Even if it&#39;s just for one night, and even if walking away the next morning isn&#39;t as easy as he thought.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Besides, one hot and incredibly intense night between a bad boy and a pampered princess could never turn into something real...could it?&lt;/p&gt;" />
