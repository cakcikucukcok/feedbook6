  <title>No Rules (An Omega Group Novel) - Starr Ambrose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jess Maulier&#39;s estranged father was more than the quiet professor of linguistics he appeared to be - she is shocked to discover he was also an operative for a covert group that rescues hostages.  Before he died he left Jess a vital clue to a rescue.  Unfortunately, it&#39;s in the form of a children&#39;s story, and she has no idea what it means. Though she resents the close professional and personal relationship the handsome and dangerous Tyler Donovan had with her absentee father, she turns to him for help. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But Tyler doesn&#39;t know how to interpret the story, either. An attempt to decipher it takes them to Egypt, where danger ignites sparks between them. Tyler can&#39;t get involved, though--Professor Shikovski advised him never to risk emotional attachments--and Jess tempts him more than could ever be safe. No matter how enticing she is, he has to maintain his distance to preserve his focus. But only mutual trust can save them from encroaching danger.&lt;/p&gt;" />
