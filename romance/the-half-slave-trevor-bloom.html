  <title>The Half-Slave - Trevor Bloom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The year is 476 AD - the Roman Empire is disintegrating and Germanic tribes are moving south. Among them are the Franks. Their ruthless young Overlord, Clovis, plans to build a new empire that will eclipse Rome&#39;s fading power, but his hope is jeopardized by the massing forces of a seaborne Saxon uprising.  One young man is sent to find out where the Saxons will strike. Ascha is the son of a Saxon warlord and a Roman slave mother, a half-slave, locked in the limbo between slave and free. As a hostage of the Franks, Ascha struggles to survive. But when the Overlord offers to make him a free man if he will spy on his own people Ascha must summon all his resources and his courage to discover where his loyalties lie." />
