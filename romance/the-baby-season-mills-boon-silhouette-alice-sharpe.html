      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;On a mission to fulfill her grandmother&#39;s wishes, civilization-loving Roxanne Salyer was utterly at sea. Her car was crumpled in the California desert. Her cell phone had gone kaput. She was sandy, sunburned–sizzling to death! And then strong, sexy Jack Wheeler rode to her rescue….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Raised to nurture a career, not a family, Roxanne was out of her depth at Jack&#39;s ranch, which teemed with newborn critters! Worse, intense, enticing Jack had a pigtailed pixie of his own, and dad and daughter stirred impossible dreams–of marriage and of motherhood. But Roxanne didn&#39;t believe in giving in to temptation–until she tasted that first kiss&lt;/p&gt;
