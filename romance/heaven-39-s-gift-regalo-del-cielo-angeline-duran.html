  <title>Heaven&#39;s Gift (Regalo Del Cielo) - Angeline Duran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ever since Michelle could remember, she had slept in the nude.
Drawing open the draperies, the piercing white moonlight filled the room. She quickly slipped on her silk robe and opened the French doors, stepped onto the terrace and took a deep languid breath. For a moment, her head grew light from the warm night breeze and the intoxicating scent from the flower garden below. She would sleep soundly tonight.
At the other end of the hall, Adolfo yanked the sheet soaked with his perspiration and threw it to the floor. He sat up. It was no use. He could not sleep. Thoughts of Michelle were driving him mad. The scent of her perfume, her wonderfully shaped mouth, her firm high breasts and her endlessly long legs haunted him. Tonight, his eyes lingered on her magnificently formed body as she walked away from him to her suite.
He rose from his bed; went directly to the bar at the other end of his suite and poured himself a cognac. Maybe if he had one last drink, it would calm him enough to sleep? Michelle had pushed him miles beyond his limit of frustration. .
Grabbing his robe he stalked from his suite. Determined, long muscular legs carried him down the hall.
He stopped at her door. Turning the knob, he let himself in. Quietly, he closed the door behind him.
There she was. Her body graced in moonlight. He watched as she slept. 
Silently, he walked to her bed and quietly sat at the edge. Waiting a moment, he gently lifted her hand to his lips. Kissing the open palm of her soft hand, he held it close to his face and whispered her name. Opening her eyes, she didn&#39;t appear frightened. She sensed it was Adolfo.
&quot;Michelle . . .Please forgive me&quot; He took a deep breath. &quot;Seeing you again tonight, I cant explain it. . .It&#39;s just that. . .&quot; The tone of his voice changed. &quot;Damn it! You know what I mean.&quot;
Not answering, she stretched out like a casually indifferent Cheshire cat. Letting the sheet fall from her body, she teasingly waited before she answered. &quot;Theres no need to explain. You just happened to be walking naked outside my door and decided to chat with me.&quot;
Suddenly he realized he had been in such a rage, his robe was still thrown over his shoulder. Flinging the robe to the ground, he raised his voice in frustration. &quot;Michelle, dont you understand? Even a blind man would be able to read my thoughts. Everyone knows I am in love with you. I would do anything for you, and yet. . .&quot; He could not finish his sentence. He was lost, unable to find the right words. 
Sitting up, revealing her nakedness, Michelle never imagined she would ever see him so vulnerable, so tormented. His defenses were crumbling before her. 
With his last words echoing in her ears and finding their way into her heart, she reached up and drew him towards her, allowing him to fall into her arms, feeling for the first time his flesh against hers. His hands slide down her body, exploring her wondrous softness beneath him.
Parting her lips, she welcomed his tongue. Her breasts stirred with life, enlarging and brushing against his warm chest. Every pore in her body sexually ached. 
Letting her hands explore, she discovered the hardness of every muscle and the thickness of every hair. The tips of her fingers slowly circled the muscles around his nipples and then let them travel down along his waist feeling the leanness of his body. She felt goosebumps rising on his buttocks and heard him moan as she reached down. She arched her back and pressed him between her legs." />
