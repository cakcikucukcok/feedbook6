  <title>Ex-Con - Katana Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;All three volumes in one HOT set!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Worse than bad.  Hotter than hot.  These are the bad boys of the Harrison Street Crew, and they answer to no one.  They take what they want.  And what they want is you.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Volume One &lt;br&gt;Ex-convict Shane McGill is as rugged and wild as they come.  Bad to the bone and back on the streets, he&#39;ll do anything and say anything to survive. Even if that something means joining the one car club he had worked so hard to avoid. But there&#39;s one person out there who can match him toe-to-toe...the hot mechanic pin-up doll of a woman with the body of a goddess and tomboy attitude would even give him a chance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume Two &lt;br&gt;Charlize &quot;Charlie&quot; Wakeman fixes cars and doesn&#39;t suffer fools.   But when the hot as hell ex-convict Shane McGill enters her mechanic shop, she can&#39;t resist one wild night with him. It was just meant to be a fling...the wildest, most thrilling fling of her life.  But Shane&#39;s too ruthless, too bad to ignore, and Charlie can&#39;t stop herself from coming back for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Volume Three&lt;br&gt;Shane McGill learned one thing from prison--if you get a second chance, don&#39;t screw it up.  Shane doesn&#39;t regret a single second of his life once he&#39;s found Charlie. She&#39;s the happiest, hottest, most important thing to happen to him.  But as tensions rise in the Harrison Street Crew, his relationship with Charlie takes on a new level of heat, and danger...&lt;/p&gt;" />
