  <title>Shattered Secrets - Karen Harper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Every town has its secrets&amp;#133;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Returning to Cold Creek, Ohio, is an act of courage for Tess Lockwood. Abducted and held captive as a young girl, she is unable to remember anything about the crime that destroyed her childhood and tore her family apart. Now a grown woman with a bright future, she is certain she has put the past behind her. But when she inherits the family home, Tess must confront the demons that still haunt her and the town of Cold Creek.&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Gabe McCord has always blamed himself for what happened to Tess. He had been a teenager when she was snatched from the group of children he was responsible for watching. Now Gabe has taken on the role of sheriff and hopes to shed new light on the cold case, especially given his growing feelings for Tess.&amp;nbsp;&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Tess isn&#39;t ready to recall what happened to her, and she has no intention of digging up any details that might remind her of the truth. But when another child in the town goes missing, she&#39;s certain it&#39;s related to her return to Cold Creek. Together,Tess and Gabe will have to work to unlock their painful memories in order to save another child and heal their damaged souls, for good&amp;#133;." />
