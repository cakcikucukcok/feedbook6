  <title>It&#39;s Always Been You (Mills &amp; Boon Kimani) (The Jacksons of Ann Arbor, Book 1) - Elle Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;They just crossed the line…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Newly minted Dr. Lovely “Love” Washington plans to devote her medical career to helping women. But her own happy ending eludes her. Then one morning she wakes up in a Vegas hotel under the sheets with the very familiar and extremely charming Dr. Drake Jackson. The longtime best friends didn’t only become overnight lovers. They got married, even if neither remembers tying the knot. And Love is tormented by sizzling memories of the passion-filled night they shared.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Matters of the heart have always fascinated Drake. Now the aspiring cardiothoracic surgeon and in-demand playboy must confront his growing feelings for his oldest, most alluring, off-limits friend. Amid a disastrous family reunion and the unwanted attention of Love’s persistent ex-boyfriend, the newlyweds are digging themselves deeper into a deception that has to end. Or does it? Has Drake finally found what’s been right in front of him all along—the true Love of his life?&lt;/p&gt;
