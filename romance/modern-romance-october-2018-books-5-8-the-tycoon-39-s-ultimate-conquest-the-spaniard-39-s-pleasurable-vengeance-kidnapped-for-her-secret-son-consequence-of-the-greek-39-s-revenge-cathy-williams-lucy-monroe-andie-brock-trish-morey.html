        &lt;h2&gt;Four red-hot romances from Mills &amp; Boon!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tycoon&#39;s Ultimate Conquest&lt;/em&gt; by Cathy Williams&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When lawyer Rose Tremain places his latest business deal in jeopardy, billionaire Arturo da Costa plans to challenge her in the boardroom. Yet when he meets spirited Rose, the sizzling connection between them is irresistible! Now seduction is his greatest asset. He’ll ensure Rose is so overwhelmed with pleasure she forgets all about the deal. Until he finds himself equally addicted—to her!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Spaniard&#39;s Pleasurable Vengeance&lt;/em&gt; by Lucy Monroe&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ruthless tycoon Basilio Perez, famed for his familial loyalty, has a new target in sight. Miranda Smith is poised to bring the Perez name into disrepute – she must be stopped! But when he meets Miranda, Basilio is captivated by her innocence and shy appeal. To uncover Randi’s secrets, his plan for revenge becomes one of lingering, passionate seduction…that tests his iron control to the limit!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kidnapped for Her Secret Son&lt;/em&gt; by Andie Brock&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Billionaire Jaco Valentino is furious when Leah McDonald leaves him without explanation. But when he discovers Leah’s given birth to his heir he’s determined to shield them from his adoptive family’s wicked intentions! Jaco kidnaps Leah and his son, whisking them away to his remote Sicilian island for their own safety. Except the sinful flame still burning between him and Leah feels infinitely dangerous…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consequence of the Greek&#39;s Revenge&lt;/em&gt; by Trish Morey&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Athena Nikolides is wary of being exploited for her newly-inherited fortune. But charismatic Alexios Kyriakos is already a billionaire, and with their overwhelmingly intense desire, Athena feels safe with him. So she’s devastated to learn Alexios only wants her to avenge himself against her father! But when the consequence of their undeniable passion is revealed, now he wants her for so much more…&lt;/p&gt;
