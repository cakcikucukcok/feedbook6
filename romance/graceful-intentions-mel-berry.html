  <title>Graceful Intentions - Mel Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Despite having grown up in a loving family, seventeen-year-old Grace always felt different. When a car accident causes her to hear a voice filled with love and longing, she embarks on a journey of discovering how different she really is. Even before she meets him in person, Grace is inexplicablybut irresistiblydrawn to Luke, a new guy in town who is somehow able to communicate with not only her thoughts but her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as she is recovering from the accident and getting to know Luke better, Graces parents reveal the real circumstances of her birth, causing Grace to question everything about her life. More revelations come to light when Luke explains that the two of them have been Tutelary Guides in previous lives. Tutelary Guides are given to some humans; some are good, while others are evil. Although Grace has always been a good guide, Luke has had to struggle to overcome his wicked nature. Despite their differences, Grace and Luke fell in love while assigned to the same human four hundred years ago. They were discovered and granted human liveslives in which they have reunited, only to be destroyed by Darcia, Lukes former leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reunited once again, this time against the dramatically beautiful landscape of Montana, Grace and Luke must work together to defeat Darcia and the forces she has sent to destroy them as part of her plan to take over the world. But can Luke stay strong enough not to revert to his former nature, and is their love solid enough to overcome evil?&lt;/p&gt;" />
