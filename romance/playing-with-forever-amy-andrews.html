  <title>Playing With Forever - Amy Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Country boy, Ryder Davis has the world at his feet. A stellar rugby career, a winning way with women and a beach view that keeps him in blue sky and bikini babes. He&#39;s living the dream.  The last thing he needs is a Great Dane called Tiny destroying his feng shui.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dog whisperer, Juliet Morgan is about to start living her dream and she&#39;s counting down the days. In two months she&#39;ll finally be moving to Italy and no man&#39;s going to stop her this time. Not even a rugby superstar with a badly behaved pooch.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when Ryder skids into the animal shelter looking for help Juliet agrees to assist him with his canine issues.  Pretty soon they&#39;re assisting each other out of their clothes and tumbling headlong into a sex thing with an expiry date. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neither of them expected it to become more. But when for now starts to feel like forever Juliet hits the panic button. Ryder knows he has to play the long game and let her walk away. After all it&#39;s not over until the final hooter sounds and all&#39;s fair in love and rugby. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Sydney Smoke Rugby series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Playing By Her Rules&lt;br&gt;* Playing It Cool&lt;br&gt;* Playing the Player&lt;br&gt;* Playing With Forever&lt;br&gt;* Playing House&lt;br&gt;* Playing Dirty&lt;/p&gt;" />
