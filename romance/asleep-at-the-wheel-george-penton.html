  <title>Asleep at the Wheel - George Penton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p 1972.  Two community college students begin a casual dating relationship, the young man quite immature and the young woman reserved and shy. Both very religious, but of different religions.  THE POTENTIAL READER SHOULD BE WARNED THAT THIS IS A VERY CATHOLIC BOOK, AND IF THE READER IS NOT CATHOLIC, THE READER PROBABLY WON&#39;T BE INTERESTED.
&lt;p&gt;The young man, bored with college, joins the Marine Corps. The couple write to each other while he is in boot camp, and when he finishes boot camp he finds, upon his arrival back home for a short leave, that he has a serious romance on his hands, a romance hes not sure he wants. The young woman seems deeply in love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The young man, among his many faults, listens to too much popular music. &quot;My generation is famous for loving its music too much, and I plead guilty as any&quot;, ; he says about himself in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did the baby boom generation love its music too much? Read &quot;Asleep at the WheeL&quot;; and decide for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
