  <title>The Wicked Vampire - Kate Baxter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;He was one of the most feared creatures in the supernatural world, and yet, she was drawn to him unlike any other. His scent ignited her thirst. The sight of him drove her mad with want...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Lovers forever--or enemies to the death?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Sasha Ivanov was born to be wild. A vampire party girl, she stalks the L.A. clubs at night. Dancing. Drinking. Indulging her darkest appetites. Never sated, she&#39;s always looking for more: more danger, more excitement, &lt;i&gt;more blood&lt;/i&gt;. But when she enters a supernatural fight club--and is tethered to her mortal enemy--Sasha realizes she&#39;s playing the most dangerous game of all... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Ewan Brún was born to kill vampires. A powerful berserker and unbeaten champion, he doesn&#39;t need a weapon to be deadly. He &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the weapon. But when his soul becomes captive to the most beautiful vampire he&#39;s ever seen, he is all but powerless. He cannot resist Sasha--and cannot fight his desires. Is their love strong enough to defeat the gathering forces of darkness that threatens to destroy them both?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &quot;&lt;b&gt;The chemistry is electric.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;--&lt;i&gt;San Francisco Book Reviews &lt;/i&gt;on &lt;i&gt;The Last True Vampire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
