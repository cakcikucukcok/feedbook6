          &lt;strong&gt;A FAMILIAR STRANGER&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jesse Calder had left Abby Martin waiting under the old cottonwood tree with a promise to return…. That had been five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, a horrific accident, lies and secrets stood between them, but when Jesse had the chance to work at Abby&#39;s ranch again, he took it. Yes, she was a widow and a mother, and not quite as forgiving as he&#39;d hoped, but time had changed him, too. He simply could not ignore the spark inside that yearned to reignite the heat between them. Or forget that Abby&#39;s little girl had eyes an all-too-familiar shade of Calder blue….&lt;/p&gt;
