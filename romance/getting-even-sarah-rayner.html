Was secretly having an affair with an influential colleague? Won a coveted promotion, then teamed you up with a mere junior, leaving you feeling completely demoted? What would you do? For Ivy there&#39;s no choice. The only person she has ever trusted, Orianna, has blown it big time. So there&#39;s only one way forward: revenge. &lt;br&gt;Ivy&#39;s campaign is brilliant, if horribly destructive, and she&#39;s determined to get even with the woman who has dared to cross her. But is Ivy really the innocent party? Or is she hiding secrets of her own? &lt;br&gt;From Sarah Rayner, the international bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;One Moment, One Morning&lt;/i&gt;, comes &lt;i&gt;Getting Even&lt;/i&gt;, an unputdownable story of jealousy, sex, friendship and backstabbing set in the heart of London&#39;s Soho adland.&lt;/p&gt;" />
