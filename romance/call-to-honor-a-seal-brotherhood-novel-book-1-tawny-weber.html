  <title>Call To Honor (A SEAL Brotherhood Novel, Book 1) - Tawny Weber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;Can these sexy SEAL’s answer the call?&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Poseidon team are hard-bodied, fiercely competitive Navy SEALs. But when a sensitive mission goes disastrously wrong, three of the team’s finest will have to trust their hearts and instincts to uncover the truth…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;“No man left behind” is inscribed in the DNA of every SEAL and Lieutenant Diego Torres is no exception. But with a team member killed—and the body missing—Diego’s honor is sorely tested. Now his career and reputation are on the line, and a traitor is hiding among them. Diego wants answers…and only one woman has them.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Single mom Harper Maclean has two priorities—raising her son Nathan and starting a new life. Her mysterious new neighbor may be impossibly charming, but Diego asks too many questions about her past—and about the father of her child. Questions she fears will reveal her burning attraction for Diego, and ultimately put them all in danger’s path.&lt;/p&gt;
