  <title>34 Seconds - Stella Samuel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nikki and Will fell in love a lifetime ago in Deltaville, Virginia. Now living in Colorado with her family, Nikki is invited to attend Will&amp;rsquo;s wedding back in Virginia where she finds her past staring her in the face.&lt;br /&gt;
Will never wanted a wife, and he broke Nikki&amp;#39;s heart long ago. Nikki knew what she wanted: a strong, happy marriage and children, a future. She found those things when she married Chris, and she and Will managed to grow their friendship after heartbreak.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A year after the wedding, Nikki is faced with her painful past again. She soon discovers she must find the strength to help Will on his own personal journey. In thirty-four seconds, she sees him slip from her life forever. Watching Will cross over to his fate, her past collides with her present, and Nikki learns she&amp;rsquo;s never been in control of her own destiny. Her own journey back to her family in Colorado becomes one of self-discovery. With the help of Will&amp;rsquo;s voice to carry her across the country, Nikki must decide how she will move forward.&lt;/p&gt;" />
