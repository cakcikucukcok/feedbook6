          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;From the New York Times bestselling author of the beloved Virgin River series comes a story of three friends who could seriously use a fresh start. A chance to shine. And maybe a little romance—the kind that sticks. &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nikki Burgess survived a terrible marriage and a worse divorce. She&#39;s just about given up hope of ever finding happiness. But when her ex-husband suddenly dies, she gets custody of her kids again—and a chance to start over. Dixie McPherson, on the other hand, has had way too much love. She has eleven tennis bracelets, dozens of trinkets, piles of sexy lingerie and a tarnished reputation when all she ever wanted was true love, a partner and a family.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Carlisle Bartlett is loyal, kindhearted and the funniest guy slinging drinks in the back of an airplane. But he has an ugly little secret. The only kind of love he&#39;s used to comes with bruises. When Nikki, Dixie and Carlisle are offered the chance to join a new airline in Las Vegas, they don&#39;t hesitate. With nothing to lose and everything to gain, these three friends are going in search of their own blue skies.&lt;/p&gt;
