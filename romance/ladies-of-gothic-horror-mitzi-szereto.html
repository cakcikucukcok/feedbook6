  <title>Ladies of Gothic Horror - Mitzi Szereto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Classic gothic horror stories from the literary mistresses of the past!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many of gothic horror&amp;rsquo;s spookiest tales have come from the pens of women. Yet a substantial number of these women were overshadowed by their male contemporaries, especially with regard to the classics. &lt;i&gt;Ladies of Gothic Horror (A Collection of Classic Stories) &lt;/i&gt;redresses this imbalance by bringing together a selection of gothic stories from the past written exclusively by women. Carefully edited and compiled by author and anthologist Mitzi Szereto, &lt;i&gt;Ladies of Gothic Horror &lt;/i&gt;offers readers plenty of good old-fashioned chills and thrills. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re a devotee of the genre, a literature lover, an academic or a student, this volume of short fiction is sure to please. The biographies accompanying each story will show that these women were &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt; but typical for their time. Includes seventeen stories from authors Mary Shelley, Elizabeth Gaskell, Edith Wharton, Marjorie Bowen, Gertrude Atherton, Virginia Woolf, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Elia W. Peattie and many more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Ladies of Gothic Horror (A Collection of Classic Stories) is a must-read for anyone who loves the horror, mystery, science fiction, or paranormal genres.&amp;quot; - Long and Short Reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;An inspiring collection, to be enjoyed in its own right, preferably by candlelight while sat in your favourite chair&amp;hellip;&amp;quot; - ScreamFix&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;rsquo;ll find some damn fine fiction in this collection and some equally impressive true stories.&amp;quot; - Get On My Damn Level book reviews&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;We have stories with ghosts, some malevolent, some seeking vengeance, and some simply waiting for a wrong to be corrected&amp;hellip;. [Including] a thoughtful look into the time period, and the challenges that these women had faced in getting published, let alone in living their everyday lives.&amp;quot; - Girl Who Reads&lt;/i&gt;" />
