  <title>Starting From Square Two (Mills &amp; Boon Silhouette) - Caren Lissner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Gert Healy thought she was finished with dating. She thought she&#39;d be picking out strollers and booties for the children she and her husband were planning to have. Instead, she&#39;s mourning his loss and coming to terms with being a widow at twenty-nine.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s been over a year now, and her friends have convinced her it&#39;s time to get back into the swing of things (even though looking for love is the last thing she wants to do). Although they&#39;ve developed many a dating rule between them, now that Gert&#39;s a part of their single-girl crew, she&#39;s beginning to realize they don&#39;t know the first thing about men. Of course, Gert doesn&#39;t know the first thing about dating, since she married her college sweetheart, so maybe joining forces will work out after all. But does Gert have it in her to fight her way through the leather-jacketed and miniskirted crowds in search of a second miracle?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s back to square one on everything. Well, actually she&#39;s done it all before. Square two, then.&lt;/p&gt;
