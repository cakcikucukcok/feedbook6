But the women of Lavender House share an uncommon gift that will lead them to days filled with danger&amp;#8212;and nights of desire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is the most ravishing creature in all of London, known for her demure smile and angelic demeanor. But Madeline Fallon, Lady Redcomb,is no mere blushing beauty. Blessed with a remarkable and mysterious talent, she is determined to discover the truth behind the recent kidnapping of a young girl.

But his motives are not pure. Engulfed by desire, praying for passion&#39;s sweet release, he would do anything to be near the enchanting Lady Redcomb. He has been bewitched&amp;#8212;seduced by her powerful, perfect spell.&lt;/p&gt;" />
