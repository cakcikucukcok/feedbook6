  <title>A Thread of Truth - Marie Bostwick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Come home to Marie Bostwick&#39;s poignant  novel of new beginnings, old friends, and the rich, varied tapestry of lives fully lived.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At twenty-seven, having fled an abusive marriage with little more than her kids and the clothes on her back, Ivy Peterman figures she has nowhere to go but up. Quaint, historic New Bern, Connecticut, seems as good a place as any to start fresh. With a part-time job at the Cobbled Court Quilt Shop and budding friendships, Ivy feels hopeful for the first time in ages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But when a popular quilting TV show is taped at the quilt shop, Ivy&#39;s unwitting appearance in an on-air promo alerts her ex-husband to her whereabouts. Suddenly, Ivy is facing the fight of her life--one that forces her to face her deepest fears as a woman and a mother. This time, however, she&#39;s got a sisterhood behind her: companions as complex, strong, and lasting as the quilts they stitch.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Marie Bostwick&#39;s A Single Thread&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Enjoy this big-hearted novel, then pass it along to your best friend.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--Susan Wiggs&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;By the time you finish this book, the women in &lt;i&gt;A Single Thread&lt;/i&gt; will feel like your own girlfriends--emotional, funny, creative and deeply caring. It&#39;s a story filled with wit and wisdom. Sit back and enjoy this big-hearted novel, and then pass it on to your best friend.&quot;&lt;br&gt;--Susan Wiggs, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Marie Bostwick beautifully captures the very essence of women&#39;s friendships--the love, the pain, the trust, the forgiveness--and crafts a seamless and heartfelt novel from them. Evelyn, Abigail, Margot, and Liza are as real and endearing as my own closest friends, and as I turned the last page I felt that sweet, satisfying sorrow in having to say goodbye that marks the work of a writer at the top of her game.&quot; --Kristy Kiernan, author of &lt;i&gt;Catching Genius&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Matters of Faith&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Bostwick makes a seamless transition from historical fiction to the contemporary scene in this buoyant novel about the value of friendship among women.  .  ..Bostwick&#39;s polished style and command of plot make this story of bonding and sisterhood a tantalizing book club contender.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly &lt;/i&gt;" />
