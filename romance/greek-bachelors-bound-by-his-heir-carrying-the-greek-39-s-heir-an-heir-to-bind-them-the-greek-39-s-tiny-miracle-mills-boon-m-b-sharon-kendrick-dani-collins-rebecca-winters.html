      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;h2&gt;Going to bed with the Greek… &lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hard-working Ellie Brooks met billionaire Alek Sarantos and her life changed. First she was fired and now she’s pregnant with the ruthless Greek’s baby! It was only supposed to be one wild, passionate night. Yet Ellie’s making a deal with this handsome devil his heir…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Theo Makricosta wants Jaya Powers to help care for his infant niece and nephew… And he hasn’t stopped thinking about their single night of passion. She can’t refuse her gorgeous Greek boss – plus, somehow she must tell him that their night together had consequences!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Navy SEAL captain Nikos Vassalos is not the man he once was, so he isolates himself on his luxury yacht. But his solitude is interrupted – by a pregnant woman who tells him he&#39;s about to be a dad! Will the tiny miracle help them find the happy ending they both deserve?&lt;/p&gt;
