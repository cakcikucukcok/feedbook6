  <title>A Very Vintage Christmas - Tilly Tennant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The fairy lights are up and shoppers are flooding the snowy seaside promenade. It&amp;#x2019;s going to be a busy month at Forget-Me-Not Vintage, a magical shop with a warm heart where every item has a story to be told.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With bright red hair and an infectious smile, &lt;b&gt;Dodie&lt;/b&gt; is a hopeless romantic and absolutely one of a kind, just like the pieces in her shop. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Dodie finds a love letter in the pocket of an old woollen coat, she makes it her mission to deliver it to its rightful owner. Following the address, she manages to persuade the handsome but reluctant new tenant, &lt;b&gt;Edward&lt;/b&gt;, to help her with her search.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the story of the letter unfolds, Dodie is there, as always, to pick up the pieces and make things right. &lt;b&gt;But who will be there for her when her own love story needs a helping hand?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is it too much to dream of a happy ending like the ones in the black and white movies she adores?&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you&amp;#x2019;re looking for a sweep-you-off-your-feet romance that will warm you through and through then the door to Forget-Me-Not Vintage is always open.
