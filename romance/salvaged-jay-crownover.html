  <title>Salvaged - Jay Crownover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The&lt;em&gt; New York Times &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;USA Today &lt;/em&gt;bestselling author of the Marked Men books continues her delightfully sexy Saints of Denver series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hudson Wheeler is a nice guy. Everyone knows it, including his fianc&amp;#233;e who left him with a canceled wedding and a baby on the way. He&amp;#8217;s tired of finishing last and is ready to start living in the moment with nights soaked in whiskey, fast cars, and even faster girls. He&amp;#8217;s set to start living on the edge, but when he meets Poppy Cruz, her sad eyes in the most gorgeous face he&amp;#8217;s ever seen hook him in right away. Wheeler can see Poppy&amp;#8217;s pain and all he wants to do is take care of her and make her smile, whatever it takes. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Poppy can&amp;#8217;t remember a time when she didn&amp;#8217;t see strangers as the enemy. After a lifetime of being hurt from the men who swore to protect her, Poppy&amp;#8217;s determined to keep herself safe by keeping everyone else at arm&amp;#8217;s length. Wheeler&amp;#8217;s sexy grin and rough hands from hours restoring classic cars shouldn&amp;#8217;t captivate her, but every time she&amp;#8217;s with him, she can&amp;#8217;t help being pulled closer to him. Though she&amp;#8217;s terrified to trust again, Poppy soon realizes it might hurt even more to shut Wheeler out&amp;#8212;and the intense feelings pulsing through her are making it near impossible to resist him. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only thing Poppy is sure of is that her heart is in need of some serious repair, and the more time she spends with Wheeler, the more she&amp;#8217;s convinced he&amp;#8217;s the only man with the tools to fix it. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
