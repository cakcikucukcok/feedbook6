            &lt;strong&gt;Captain of Her Heart&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sold into slavery by her jealous sisters, Ada finds herself captive on the ship of a Greek merchant. Expecting a harsh new master, she&#39;s surprised to find the captain compassionate–and attractive. Yet she can&#39;t fall for the man who owns her–not when she watched her enslaved mother pine after her unyielding father.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nicolaus only wants to rescue the beautiful, mistreated woman from the auction block. He plans to free Ada, just as soon as he secures his inheritance. Which means racing the ship back to his homeland to best his brother. If he loses, all his cargo will be forfeited–including Ada. But as perilous storms reveal her courage and grace, the question becomes, can his heart stand to let her go?&lt;/p&gt;
