          &lt;em&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Enticed by His Forgotten Lover &lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Hotelier Rafael always gets what he wants and he’d wanted Bryony’s hotel – and Bryony! One incredible night got him just that. Now Bryony comes to New York. But Rafael has no idea who the pregnant woman is, so they return to the island where it began, seeking the tycoon memories!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;Wanted by Her Lost Love&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Ryan Beardsley finds his ex-fiancée working in a dingy diner, desperate and pregnant, he’s furious! Whether the baby is his – or his brother’s – Ryan demands that Kelly return to New York with him. For the baby’s sake. Or maybe because Kelly’s as irresistible as ever…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Tempted by Her Innocent Kiss&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Ashley Carter’s dreams of true love are crushed by the discovery that her marriage to Devon Carter is another of her father’s business deals. Her strategy: act the part of perfect wife and make Devon love her! After all, she will be the mother of his child…&lt;/p&gt;
