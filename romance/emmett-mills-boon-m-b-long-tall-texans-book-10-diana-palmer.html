  <title>Emmett (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) (Long, Tall Texans, Book 10) - Diana Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Single dad Emmett Deverell thought moving to Jacobsville, Texas, would mean &quot;quality time&quot; with his children. Then he realized the truth–his kids were uncontrollable! He knew the three little rapscallions needed a woman&#39;s influence. But the only female available was Melody Cartman…and Emmett trusted her about as far as he could throw her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Melody&#39;s new charges were a force to be reckoned with. But it was their &lt;em&gt;father&lt;/em&gt; who proved a handful. That sexy wink of his was enough to send a woman into orbit. She knew Emmett would never forgive her past, though, which was definitely a problem. Because being part of Emmett&#39;s family was a habit Melody didn&#39;t want to break.&lt;/p&gt;
