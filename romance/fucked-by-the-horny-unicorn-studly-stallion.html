  <title>Fucked By The Horny Unicorn - Studly Stallion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jenna stopped suddenly in the middle of the road when she saw something impossible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A unicorn! Of course she didn&amp;rsquo;t have her camera at the ready.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But when it bounded into the forest, she had to make a choice. Follow it or forget she ever saw it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bringing my car to a stop I couldn&amp;#39;t believe what I was seeing. In the middle of the road stood a pure, sapphire unicorn. Rubbing my eyes and pinching myself, I watched this large, beautiful animal look into my car with a curious expression.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I frantically searched around for a camera so I could at least have proof I saw unicorn. But with my luck, I couldn&amp;#39;t find my camera. Maybe I could get something else that would prove that this was real instead of a dream.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe some hair. That was it! Should I dare approach him?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As soon as I stepped outside my vehicle, the unicorn pranced out into a meadow. Not believing what I was seeing, I followed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;How in the world am I going to prove that you exist?&amp;quot; I muttered to myself, feeling foolish since no one was around.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He allowed me to approach him. I wasn&amp;#39;t frightened, but rather in awe of what I was seeing. It may have been dangerous to approach such a beast, but I had to prove it was alive, even if it was just for just my own curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stepping forward, the unicorn sniffed my clothes and looked into my eyes. I felt a connection to the creature and wanted to please him. I couldn&amp;#39;t explain it, but that&amp;#39;s how I felt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the unicorn tore off my shirt, I just stood there and shivered. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe this was happening and didn&amp;#39;t know how to handle it. Tentatively, I touched his muzzle and felt his soft nose. I felt a strong urge overcome my senses and found myself ripping off my bra, bearing my breasts to him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His soft muzzle rested on my pert breasts as he licked at my nipples. Shuddering in pleasure, I shoved them in his face. He nuzzled and sucked on one of my breasts as I stood there, shuddering with pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He switched to the other one and sucked it into his large mouth as his tongue lashed my nipple. I panted as excitement filled me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My hand slid down to my pants and slid underneath to my panties as I touched my soft folds and excited clit." />
