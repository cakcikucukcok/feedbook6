  <title>Dark Fire - Christine Feehan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There is always a price to pay...&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So Darius warned her when she accepted a position with his traveling troupe. And gazing mesmerized at the merciless slash of his mouth, the implacable resolve on his face, the soulless emptiness of his black eyes, Tempest was afraid to ask what it was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had always been different, apart from others. From the moment his arms closed around her, enveloping her in a sorcerer&#39;s spell, Darius seemed to understand her unique gifts. But did his kiss offer the love and belonging she sought, or a danger more potent than his own panthers?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Somewhere deep inside herself, Tempest realized she knew the answer. She had no choice but to accept the velvet stroke of his tongue, submit to the white-hot heat piercing her skin, welcome an erotic pleasure like no other&amp;#8230;.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Dark Fire - Christine Feehan</i></b> | — Christine Feehan. Christine regularly writes about her books (and all kinds of subjects) in the following places: ... DARK FIRE. Lucian was dark and dangerous, a predator, an immortal, a Carpathian. Jaxon is a petite, curvy and courageous. ...<br /><b><i>Dark Fire by Christine Feehan</i></b> | I still Highly Recommend Dark Fire and all of the Dark Series. If you like Christine Feehans books you really should try her GhostWalker series, which is entirely different then The Dark series and it isn't about Ghost, but medically enhanced military men an women. Another Great series by Ms.Feehan. Check it Out<br /><b><i>Dark Fire: A Carpathian Novel (Dark Series): Feehan ...</i></b> | I re-read "Dark Fire" and hated it. Christine Feehan may be a legendary author but in my opinion she uses too many repetitive themes and her character developments are weak and sidetracked by sex and meaningless arguments. Darius is a Carpathian who is feared by many.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Dark Fire - Christine Feehan</a> </h3></p><hr/>
