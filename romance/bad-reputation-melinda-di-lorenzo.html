  <title>Bad Reputation - Melinda Di Lorenzo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Everyone knows Joey by reputation–he&#39;s the wealthiest, sexiest bad boy on campus, with a different girl on his arm every week. But Joey&#39;s hard-partying ways are a front, his way of escaping a painful past, and limited to weekends only–Monday to Friday he suits up and stays in control while working for his developer father to make amends.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Tucker is Joey&#39;s polar opposite. Growing up on the wrong side of the tracks made her determined to make a better life for herself–and others–by helping to save the local community center similar to the one where she found support during tough times. When she runs into Joey (literally), the attraction is immediate–but her distrust runs deep.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Joey is equally smitten with Tucker, and throws himself into helping her with her fund-raising. Soon they start to fall hard for each other–but how can Joey convince Tucker she can trust him with her heart, when he&#39;s hiding a secret that could drive them apart for good?&lt;/p&gt;
