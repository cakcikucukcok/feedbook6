  <title>Bachelor Boys - Kate Saunders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As the child of remote, chilly parents, Cassie reveled in the exuberant chaos she found at the home of the Darlings--two boys, a cheerful father, and a glorious mother, Phoebe, who welcomed the lonely little girl next door into their family circle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Cassie is all grown up, the editor of a highly respectable literary magazine, with a well-ordered life and a suitable boyfriend. But her beloved Phoebe is dying and comes to Cassie with one last request:  Will Cassie help find wives for her sons, two gorgeous, sexy, but wildly impractical bachelors still living in their mother&#39;s basement flat?  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heartbroken at the thought of losing Phoebe, Cassie cannot refuse--but how will she ever find decent girlfriends, let alone wives, for the Darling boys?  It&#39;s all very well for Phoebe to insist they are lovely boys who are absolutely sweet to their mother, but who else would see either one as husband material: Fritz, a handsome medical student turned unemployed actor; or Ben, a dreamy, soulful musician who is too &quot;sensitive&quot; to perform or teach?  Even Cassie, she tells Phoebe firmly right from the start, is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; prepared to marry one of these bachelor boys. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate Saunders&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Bachelor Boys&lt;/i&gt; is a story about love and loss that&#39;s moving, wise, and wickedly funny.&lt;/p&gt;" />
