  <title>Until You Loved Me (Silver Springs, Book 3) - Brenda Novak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Sometimes starting over means finding everything you&#39;ve been missing…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After catching her fiance cheating – with another man – straight-laced, workaholic Ellie Fisher liberates her wild side just long enough to indulge in a passionate one-night stand with a tall, dark stranger she never quite catches the name of. Embarrassed by her recklessness, she hopes never to see him again…until a pregnancy test turns positive.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Professional football player, Hudson King has always been cautious around women. But this one seemed different – so disinterested in his celebrity and genuinely interested in him. But when Ellie tracks him down, claiming she&#39;s carrying his baby, he&#39;s stunned.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But after growing up as an orphan, he&#39;ll do anything to stay involved in his child&#39;s life, so he urges Ellie to move to Silver Springs, where they can co-parent. Hudson has a lot of love to give, certainly enough for his child, and when their initial spark reignites, perhaps for Ellie, too…&lt;/p&gt;
