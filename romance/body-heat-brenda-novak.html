  <title>Body Heat - Brenda Novak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twelve people have been shot at point-blank range and left to rot in the desert sun. It&#39;s Sophia St. Claire&#39;s job to do something about it. She&#39;s Bordertown, Arizona&#39;s new chief of police&amp;mdash;and she&#39;s out of her depth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Help arrives in the form of Department 6 hired gun Roderick Guerrero. As far as Sophia&#39;s concerned, his involvement only makes things worse. Maybe he&#39;s managed to turn his life around. And maybe he&#39;s a good investigator. But as the bastard son of a wealthy local rancher, he has a history he can&#39;t get past. A history that includes her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Rod refuses to leave town until the killer is caught. He&#39;s not worried about the danger posed by some vigilante. It&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Sophia&lt;/em&gt; who threatens him. Because he&#39;s used to risking his life&amp;mdash;but his heart is another story." />
