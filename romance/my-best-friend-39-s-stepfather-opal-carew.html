  <title>My Best Friend&#39;s Stepfather - Opal Carew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She&#39;s always craved his touch...even though it&#39;s forbidden. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Ash is assigned her first feature as a reporter, it should have been simple: interview a real life Dominant for an article about BDSM. But her subject is none other than Darien Gallagher, her best friend&#39;s stepfather...and it&#39;ll be an interview she never forgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What started for Dare as a lesson in sensual domination suddenly has become so much more. He can&#39;t deny the spark between them, even though he knows she&#39;s completely off limits. With every seductive word, every lesson, Dare tests Ash&#39;s resolve and pushes her boundaries. But at the same time, her boss Adam has her craving things she shouldn&#39;t. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Ash finds herself dreaming of both men, a dark secret threatens to destroy everything. But how can she hold onto a relationship that isn&#39;t even real?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newest romance from Opal Carew, &lt;i&gt;My Best Friend&#39;s Stepfather &lt;/i&gt;is everything fans desire!&lt;/p&gt;" />
