  <title>Her Lucky Cowboy - Jennifer Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything&#39;s bigger in Big Sky country, including the hearts of the Montana Men &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Champion rodeo rider Dane Bowden is eight seconds from winning under the Vegas lights, one last hurrah before reluctantly returning to his family&#39;s Montana ranch. But his bull has other plans. When Dane wakes up, he&#39;s sure he&#39;s died and gone to heaven . . . because the doctor who comes to his aid is the same girl who saved his life and disappeared years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell would do anything for Dane. He&#39;s the fantasy that always kept her going. A child genius hidden away by her family, Bell was the secret no one talked about, the girl no one wanted. Despite finding success as a young surgeon, she&#39;s still the awkward girl who&#39;s never had a boyfriend. So why does Dane, a notorious playboy and sizzling-hot cowboy, insist on taking her on a real date?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bell is the only woman in Dane&#39;s heart. When a rodeo rivalry turns deadly, it&#39;s his turn to save Bell&#39;s life&amp;#8212;because he sure as hell won&#39;t lose his guardian angel again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
