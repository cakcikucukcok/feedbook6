  <title>Heart of the Falcon - Francis Ray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Madelyn Taggart has shattered her share of glass ceilings. As a young engineer at a Houston oil company, she&#39;s managed to make it in a mostly older, all-male, all-white industry. But her success has come at a high cost to her love life. So far this classic beauty has made zero headway in finding the man of her dreams...until she sees a photograph of one of her brother&#39;s friends, and is determined to meet him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daniel Falcon is a bit of a Lone Star legend. He&#39;s off-the-charts handsome and very, very rich. All the ladies entertain fantasies about being &quot;the one&quot;...and soon find out he&#39;s not the type to settle down. Then Daniel meets his friend Matt&#39;s little sister. This Madelyn clearly has eyes for him but there&#39;s something about her that makes Daniel take a closer look. She&#39;s clever beyond compare, and ambitious, and sexy as the day is long. Is she soul-mate material? For the first time Daniel can remember, he&#39;s going to take his time to find out--beginning with one slow, passionate embrace...&lt;/p&gt;" />
