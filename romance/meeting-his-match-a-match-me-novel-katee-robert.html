  <title>Meeting His Match (A Match Me Novel) - Katee Robert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A satisfying category romance from Entangled&#39;s brand new Lovestruck imprint...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;This CEO has finally met his match...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When New York matchmaker Addison St. Claire is tasked with matching her best friend&#39;s new brother-in-law, she almost refuses. But the sexy southern CEO turns out to be a challenge she can&#39;t resist, because if anyone needs to meet his soul mate, it&#39;s &lt;i&gt;this&lt;/i&gt; man. And if matching him with someone else removes the temptation of being near him? Even better.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The last thing Caine McNeill needs is a matchmaker--especially a gorgeous redhead who spouts nonsense about soul mates, critiques what he drives and how he dresses, buys him a &lt;i&gt;dog&lt;/i&gt;, and pesters him about a million little things he couldn&#39;t care less about. It&#39;s a crying shame he has to keep his hands off because chemistry like what&#39;s flaring between them ought to be explored. Thoroughly. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And so the battle begins. Addison is determined to stick to her plan of setting him up on dates with other women, and Caine is equally determined to ignore these women and seduce &lt;i&gt;her&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
