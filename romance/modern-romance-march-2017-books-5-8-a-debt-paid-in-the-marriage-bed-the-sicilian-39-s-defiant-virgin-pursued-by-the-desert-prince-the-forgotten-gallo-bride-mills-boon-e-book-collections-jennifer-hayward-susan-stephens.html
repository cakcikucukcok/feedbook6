        &lt;h2&gt;Four passion filled romances from Mills and Boon!&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Debt Paid in the Marriage Bed&lt;/em&gt; by Jennifer Hayward&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;The unwilling Ricci wife…&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Angelina’s world is shattered when Lorenzo Ricci walks through the door of her engagement party and demands she call off the wedding – because she’s still married to him! She left the formidable Italian to save her heart, now with her family business at stake, Angelina must consider his terms…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In need of an heir, Lorenzo will use any means to reclaim his wayward wife and return her to their marriage bed. He’ll make her debts disappear if she repays him…in desire! The chemistry may be alive and well between them, but can they survive their tempestuous reunion unscathed?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sicilian’s Defiant Virgin&lt;/em&gt; by Susan Stephens&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Do what you have to, Luca. Seduce her, if you must.’&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Luca Tebaldi spent his life distancing himself from the family empire. So he’s furious at being drawn back in by a gold-digger who’s gotten hold of his late brother’s entire estate!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He’ll make Jen Sanderson take her claws out of her ill-gotten riches by luring her to his Sicilian island and seducing the truth out of her!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Luca discovers that Jen is innocent in more ways than one… The sensual virgin challenges him and sets his senses on fire, but is he ready to confront the truth she is enticing out of him?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pursued by the Desert Prince&lt;/em&gt; by Dani Collins&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Draped in the Desert Prince’s diamonds…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To ensure his sister’s successful marriage, Kasim, Crown Prince of Zhamair, must stop Angelique Sauveterre’s alleged affair with his future brother-in-law. But when Angelique denies any involvement, Kasim can’t resist the chance to make the feisty beauty his!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Angelique is tempted by Kasim’s offer of a fling – always compared to her twin sister, she’s never allowed to just be herself. They couldn’t be from two more different worlds, yet Angelique blossoms under Kasim’s touch, and surrenders to the desert Prince. But can he give her more than passion and precious jewels?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Forgotten Gallo Bride&lt;/em&gt; by Natalie Anderson&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&#39;Do I know you?&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Zara Falconer’s convenient wedding to tycoon Tomas Gallo freed her from her mercenary uncle. She believes their vows were swiftly annulled but, unbeknownst to Zara, a car crash wiped Tomas’s memory before he could release her from their agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Grateful to her rescuer, Zara agrees to be housekeeper at Tomas’s English mansion while he recovers. Prowling the corridors is the tortured shadow of a commanding man – who she’s shocked to discover is still her husband!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Being in close proximity to Tomas again awakens a powerful longing between them. Will this intense hunger remind him of the ties that bind them?&lt;/p&gt;
