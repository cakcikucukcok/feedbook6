  <title>Snowfall - Shelley Shepard Gray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Shelley Shepard Gray spins a beautiful holiday tale of finding love in unexpected places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twenty-year old Ruth Stutzman is a wonderful caregiver&amp;#8212;but she has no experience with kinner. Laid off from her job at a retirement home due to budget cuts, she&amp;#8217;s relieved to find work&amp;#8212;even if it means temporarily watching widower Martin Rodes&amp;#8217; brood of six!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin has done the best he can since his wife&amp;#8217;s passing, but he and the children need help. Their house, once full of laughter and light, has been darkened by sadness. Soon after Ruth arrives, the children are drawn to her warmth and gentleness, and so is Martin, even though he feels it&amp;#8217;s wrong. But the harder he tries to ignore her, the deeper he begins to care for this attractive young woman who has brought joy back into his children&amp;#8217;s lives . . . and his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each passing day brings the Rodes closer to Ruth . . . and closer to Christmas, when she will have to say goodbye. Ruth, too, cannot deny the bond she feels with the children&amp;#8212;and with Martin. When her old job becomes available again, Ruth finds herself torn. How can she stay with the Rodes? Yet how can she go?&lt;/p&gt;" />
