  <title>And Then I Danced in a Yellow Dress - Tanya Chapman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Forty-something Beverly Brown, who feels as common as her
name, embarks on an insightful, and often humorous journey of
self-discovery. Along the way she meets Grant, a paraplegic French
Canadian, who relights her passion for music and helps her discover
things she never realized about herself. But they both know right
from the get-go that they only have six weeks before he moves back
to Montreal, and he does not believe in long distance relationships. Is
it worth the risk to open up her heart again knowing it will soon be
broken? Or can she make him change his mind?
Theres also Jack, the part-time judge she works with. There is a bit
of sexual tension in their friendly relationship that Bev tries hard to
ignore. Now Jack has offered her a job in his law firm in the city. It
sounds exciting, but also seems a bit more change than she is ready to
make. Throw in her needy adult children, her narrow minded family
and her manipulative ex-husband and it is easy to see how Bev has
locked herself away in her self-made cocoon for so long.
This is not a romance, but there is love. It is not religious, but there
is spiritual confl ict. It is not a comedy, though there is humor. It
is, however, a life changing story of confronting guilt, regret, and
unfulfilled dreams, and rediscovering passion and hope for a purpose
filled future." />
