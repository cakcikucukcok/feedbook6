            &lt;strong&gt;Fall for these two beloved stories about life, love and second chances.&lt;/strong&gt;
          &lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;Love by Degree&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;by Debbie Macomber&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When Ellen Cunningham decides to go back to school as a mature student, she knows that money is going to be tight. She also knows she&#39;s lucky to find inexpensive lodging in a house near the campus, but she didn&#39;t count on having to live with three college-aged boys–or deal with the bad-tempered landlord, Reed Morgan. Reed has no patience for college-boy antics, but the chemistry between him and Ellen might warm him up to his new tenants…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;The Rain Sparrow&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;by Linda Goodnight&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Renowned yet private, thriller writer Hayden Winters lives a life colored by lies. As he is deeply ashamed of his past, his hunger for an honest relationship and dreams of starting a family remain unsatisfied, and he can trust no one with his secrets—until he meets Carrie Riley. When they discover a vulnerable young boy hiding at the inn where Hayden is staying, the two are compelled to help him, and soon they&#39;re drawn into a centuries-old mystery that will either bring them closer together—or tear them apart.&lt;/p&gt;
