  <title>Agent Abduction - Kristine Lichtlider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Dash Dawson is the ultimate alpha male, an ex special forces op who specializes in abductions. When he is contracted to kidnap a lovely banking executive and her daughter, he is prepared to keep his charges bound, gagged, and naked for his own protection. He is not prepared to deal with the submissive lust they exhibit. Soon Dash finds himself getting involved with his captives. Can he put his feelings aside and complete the mission?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Without saying a word Dash sent the switch slicing through the air to connect solidly with one of her already throbbing nipples. She cried out, guttural, animalistic sounds escaping from her throat, and thrashed about like a fish on a line. Dash tapped the other nipple gently, and her whole body tightened up, muscles rippling across her naked skin.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You know, feeling pain isn&amp;rsquo;t nearly as terrible as anticipating pain,&amp;rdquo; Dash said. &amp;ldquo;I imagine you probably heard that during your training, too. But experience and theory are&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;&lt;br /&gt;
He whipped the switch against her unmarked nipple, and she screamed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;&amp;mdash;two very different things,&amp;rdquo; he continued. Dash hissed in mock sympathy at the red line across both her tortured areola. &amp;ldquo;Oh, that must really smart.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dash pressed the pointed end of the switch into her nipple, right in the center. The girl cried out even louder as he distended the flesh, pressing harder as the stick bent with tension. Tears spilled out of her eyes and ran up to her hairline, leaving streaks on her dirty face. At last he pulled the switch away, and she whimpered as he pressed it lightly up against the other nipple.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I think you&amp;rsquo;re starting to get it,&amp;rdquo; he said, pushing the switch into her violet flesh. She thrashed about on her line so violently she actually managed to pull away from the switch, but her relief was short lived. Dash locked his muscular arm around her bound thighs and applied the switch with even more vigor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For nearly an hour, Dash walked around her naked, dangling body and alternately lashed, prodded, and scratched her skin. Sweat dripped into his eyes, but he blinked it away and kept up the assault. Soon her skin was covered with scarlet streaks, some of them bleeding slightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dash dropped the switch on the ground and bent over, hands on knees, to look the girl in her face. Her eyes were full of impotent fury and desperation, and she kept up a nigh continuous litany of screams, her voice long since gone hoarse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hey,&amp;rdquo; he said &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re not losing it already, are you? Because I have many more rare delights for you to experience..." />
