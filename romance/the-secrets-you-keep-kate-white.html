She&amp;#8217;s still recovering from a devastating car accident that has left her haunted by recurring, smoke-filled nightmares. Worse still, she can&amp;#8217;t shake the ominous feeling her dreams contain a warning.&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of their relationship, Bryn&amp;#8217;s husband Guy couldn&amp;#8217;t have been more supportive. But after they move into a new house together, disturbing incidents occur and Guy grows evasive. Bryn is increasingly unsettled, and then a woman hired to cater their dinner party is brutally murdered. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Bryn&amp;#8217;s world unravels&amp;#8212;and yet another woman in town is slain &amp;#8212;she must summon her old strength to find answers and protect her own life. Her nightmares may in fact hold the key to unlocking the truth and unmasking the murderer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With unexpected, riveting twists, &lt;em&gt;The Secrets You Keep&lt;/em&gt; is an utterly compelling psychological thriller that once again showcases Kate White&amp;#8217;s extraordinary storytelling talent.&lt;/p&gt;" />
