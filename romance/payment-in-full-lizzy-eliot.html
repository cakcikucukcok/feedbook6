  <title>Payment In Full - Lizzy Eliot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Dean got home on leave from the Middle East and rushed her into marriage. When his Army buddies catch up with them in a remote cottage, she learns about his gambling debts for the first time. They&amp;rsquo;ve come to collect, and she&amp;rsquo;s his only asset. Using her gives them some of what they want, but barely covers the collection fees. Selling her to a sex club might cover the balance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Sometime later, Dean got up and looked at me. &amp;ldquo;You look so fucking yummy trussed up that way,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt awkward and silly still bound, but on the other hand&amp;hellip;&amp;ldquo;It turned you on,&amp;rdquo; I said, happily.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You too. I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen you come so hard before. Now that I know how much that shit gets you aroused; I&amp;rsquo;ll tie you up a lot. And differently each time.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I didn&amp;rsquo;t know either, until now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He untied my ankles, but the retied them to the end of the bed, so I was spread-eagled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What are you doing?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He gave me a wicked smile.&amp;nbsp; &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m going to get a nice, hot shower, then I&amp;rsquo;ll bring our shit in,&amp;rdquo; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Untie me and I can help.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He shook his head. &amp;ldquo;I want you just like this. All trussed up and wondering what will happen next. I can look at you as I walk by, all sexy and waiting for me to decide what I&amp;rsquo;ll do to you next.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;But Dean&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He laughed and grabbed up his underpants and stuffed them in my mouth, then tied them in with another piece of rope. He straightened and smiled, running his hands over my belly and down to my pussy, trailing his fingers through it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Damn, but that cunt is fucking inviting.&amp;rdquo; Then he went into the bathroom. My husband was enjoying being the big stud dominating his woman. I was getting off on it too.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I tugged on my bonds, but they were too tight. I heard the shower come on and started thinking about what else he&amp;rsquo;d do to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A short time later, I heard a car. Someone had pulled up outside. I tried to call out to warn Dean, but his underwear stifled me. I heard voices, then footsteps.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly being tied up and gagged wasn&amp;rsquo;t fun.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The door opened and two men came in; they stopped and looked at me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, my,&amp;rdquo; the man standing in the doorway said. He was in his late thirties and squarely built, with short hair. He ran his eyes over me, smiling in a very unfriendly, almost predatory way. &amp;ldquo;You must be Cindy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know if him knowing my names was a good thing or a bad one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Shower is running,&amp;rdquo; a second man said. This one was tall &amp;mdash; a big man. He was shirtless and his muscular arms and chest were covered with tattoos.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Get Dean out here,&amp;rdquo; the first man said. As the second man headed to the bathroom, the first one looked at me. &amp;ldquo;I was pretty sure that Dean would have a nice piece with him. Seeing you, I&amp;rsquo;m thinking maybe coming way the fuck out here was worth the trouble.&amp;rdquo;" />
