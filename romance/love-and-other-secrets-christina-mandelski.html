  <title>Love and Other Secrets - Christina Mandelski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Star lacrosse player Alex &quot;Kov&quot; Koviak has it all. Or so everyone thinks. He&#39;s real good at pretending  his life is perfect...until he meets Bailey. The girl challenges him and pushes him and makes him laugh like he&#39;s never laughed before. Their friendship is their little secret, and he&#39;s happy to keep her to himself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between school, two jobs, and trying to get into NYU film school, Bailey Banfield has zero time for a social life. But then she meets Alex in her express lane at the grocery store, and their secret friendship becomes the only place she can breathe. She refuses to complicate that with more. No matter how charming Alex can be.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Bailey decides to film outrageous promposals for her NYU application, she enlists Alex&#39;s help to plan an over-the-top, epic promposal to someone else. Too bad the only prom date Alex wants anywhere near Bailey is him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a guy who seems to have it all, he&#39;s about to lose the only thing he&#39;s ever wanted.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Crush contains a cocky lacrosse player in over his head with his secret best friend, unexpected midnight kisses, swoon-worthy slow dancing, and movie-night cuddling that&#39;ll make you ache. You&#39;re going to want an Alex of your own!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Each book in the First Kiss Hypothesis series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* The First Kiss Hypothesis&lt;br&gt;* Love and Other Secrets&lt;br&gt;* Stuck With You&lt;/p&gt;" />
