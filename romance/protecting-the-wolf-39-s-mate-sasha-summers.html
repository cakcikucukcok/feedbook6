He&#39;s determined to keep her safe, even though she&#39;s hell-bent on revenge, even if that means sacrificing himself. And it might come to that when the big bad comes back for the one woman he can&#39;t live without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Books in the Blood Moon Brotherhood series:&lt;br&gt;Falling for the Billionaire Wolf and His Baby&lt;br&gt;Rescued by the Wolf&lt;br&gt;Protecting the Wolf&#39;s Mate&lt;/p&gt;" />
