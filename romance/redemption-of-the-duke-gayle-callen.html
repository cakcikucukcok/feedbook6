No one expected anything of him . . . until tragedy strikes. Now Adam is the new Duke of Rothford, determined to right the wrongs he&#39;s done. Except a secret in his past means helping the one woman who doesn&#39;t want his help at all . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not every day that a duke introduces himself to a woman sitting by herself in Hyde Park. Faith Cooper is even more surprised when Adam offers her a position as a lady&#39;s companion to his elderly aunt.
