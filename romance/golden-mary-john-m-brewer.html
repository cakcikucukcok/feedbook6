  <title>Golden Mary - John M. Brewer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Theres a bit of bad history between Master Henry Barrowby, a member of the Commons for Bedfordshire, and nobleman Lord Lavenham. Barrowby was once engaged to Mary Swanford, whose familys land bordered his. But Lavenham stepped in and seduced Mary, leaving Barrowby heartbroken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While helping Master Easterling, a wealthy London goldsmith, purchase church land seized by Henry VIII, Barrowby meets Easterlings daughter, Mary. Ironically, Lavenham is now courting Mary Easterling, a beautiful blond and intelligent woman. Barrowby warns Mary of Lavenhams past romantic dalliances and shenanigans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While shopping in London, Barrowby is attacked and seriously injured by Lavenhams minions. No longer safe in his current lodgings, the Easterling family hides Barrowby during his recovery. Mary and Barrowby become lovers and plan a wedding. But Lavenham is not to be deterred. His henchmen and hirelings lure Henry out for repeated attacks, abduction, and murder in this contest of wits over church lands and the love of Golden Mary.&lt;/p&gt;" />
