  <title>Return of the Bad Boy - Jessica Lemmon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;He&#39;s a mess...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Asher Knight has three constants in his life: music, beautiful women, and a bottle of Jack. He lives for the next gig, the next city, and dreams only of a life spent in front of an arena full of screaming fans. But Asher&#39;s nomad ways come to a sudden stop when he learns he&#39;s the father of a three-year-old from a past relationship and suddenly this rock star bad boy is forced to put down roots.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Only she can clean up&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Gloria Shields is no one&#39;s fool. Sure, the sexual chemistry between her and Asher has always been intense, but she&#39;d never risk giving her heart to a man who has a perfect record for breaking them. Except the man desperate to make things right with his newfound son is nothing like the rock god she&#39;s guarded her heart against for years. And it isn&#39;t long before she starts to wonder if life with this bad boy might be the best thing that&#39;s ever happened to her." />
