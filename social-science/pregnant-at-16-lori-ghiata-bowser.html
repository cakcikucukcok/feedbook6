  <title>Pregnant at 16 - Lori Ghiata Bowser</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Pregnant at 16&quot; is a deeply personal, informative and impassioned reflection on the outcome of the author&#39;s life as a result of her choice to carry and keep her baby when she became pregnant as a teenager, in 1974.&lt;p&gt;
Lori&#39;s conversational style of writing eases the reader into her story effortlessly.  Her narrative voice is friendly and charming, allowing the reader to develop a sense of personal rapport with the author.&lt;p&gt;
Her passion and understanding for the pressures of teenage life are evident in her writing, and she creates a vivid portrait of the teenage social climate that rings true even today.  She handles difficult topics - teenage pregnancy and abortion - with tact, and her experience in the medical field brings interesting insight to an often-veiled issue.&lt;p&gt;
Her genuine, heart-felt prayer is that &quot;Pregnant at 16&quot; will soften hardened hearts toward young, unwed pregnant teenagers and their precious unborn children, and ultimately rescue the unborn from destruction by abortion.&lt;p&gt;
Thirty-five years after her personal experience with teen pregnancy, Lori is now &quot;Honey&quot; to one, &quot;Momma&quot; to three, &quot;Gramma&quot; to four, and remains her daddy&#39;s &quot;Little Papoochnick.&quot;&lt;p&gt;
Lori and her husband, Joe, enjoy easy river kayaking, mountain hikes, casual evening walks, and entertaining as many guests as they can possibly squeeze into their home." />
