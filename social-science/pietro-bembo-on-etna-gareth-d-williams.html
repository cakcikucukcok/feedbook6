  <title>Pietro Bembo on Etna - Gareth D. Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is centered on the Venetian humanist Pietro Bembo (1470-1547), on his two-year stay in Sicily in 1492-4 to study the ancient Greek language under one of its most distinguished contemporary teachers, the Byzantine &amp;#233;migr&amp;#233; Constantine Lascaris, and above all on his ascent of Mount Etna in 1493. The more particular focus of this study is on the imaginative capacities that crucially shape Bembo&#39;s elegantly crafted account, in Latin, of his Etna adventure in his so-called &lt;em&gt;De Aetna&lt;/em&gt;, published at the Aldine press in Venice in 1496. This work is cast in the form of a dialogue that takes place between the young Bembo and his father Bernardo (himself a prominent Venetian statesman with strong humanist involvements) after Pietro&#39;s return to Venice from Sicily in 1494. But &lt;em&gt;De Aetna &lt;/em&gt;offers much more than a one-dimensional account of the facts, sights and findings of Pietro&#39;s climb. Far more important in the present study is his eye for creative elaboration, or for transforming his literal experience on the mountain into a meditation on his coming-of-age at a remove from the conventional career-path expected of one of his station within the Venetian patriciate. Three mutually informing features that are critical to the artistic originality of &lt;em&gt;De Aetna&lt;/em&gt; receive detailed treatment in this study: (i) the stimulus that Pietro drew from the complex history of Mount Etna as treated in the Greco-Roman literary tradition from Pindar onwards; (ii) the striking novelty of &lt;em&gt;De Aetna&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s status as the first Latin text produced at the nascent Aldine press in the prototype of what modern typography knows as Bembo typeface; and (iii) Pietro&#39;s ingenious deployment of Etna as a powerful, multivalent symbol that simultaneously reflects the diverse characterizations of, and the generational differences between, father and son in the course of their dialogical exchanges within &lt;em&gt;De Aetna&lt;/em&gt;." />
