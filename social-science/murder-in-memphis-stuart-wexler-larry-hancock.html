  <title>Murder In Memphis - Stuart Wexler, Larry Hancock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Uncovering previously unknown FBI files and sources, as well as new forensics, the authors of &lt;i&gt;America&#39;s Secret Jihad&lt;/i&gt; convincingly make the case that  Martin Luther King was assassinated by a clear and long simmering conspiracy orchestrated by the racial terrorists who were responsible for the Mississippi Burning murders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This explosive book details the long-simmering effort by a group of the nation&#39;s most violent racial terrorists to kill Martin Luther King. &lt;i&gt;Murder in Memphis&lt;/i&gt; convincingly makes the case that while James Earl Ray was part of the assassination plot to kill King, the preponderance of evidence also demonstrates a clear and well-orchestrated conspiracy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Thoroughly researched and impeccably documented, the book reveals a network of racist militants led by Sam Bowers, head of the White Knight of the Ku Klux Klan of Mississippi, who were dedicated to the cause of killing King. The White Knights were formed in the cauldron of anti-integrationist resistance that was Mississippi in the early 1960s and were responsible for more than 300 separate acts of violence, including the infamous Mississippi Burning murders. The authors have located previously unknown FBI files and sources which detail the bounty offer as well as new forensics information regarding unmatched fingerprints and an audio recording of an admission that a key suspect obtained a weapon to be used in killing King. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For years Americans have debated issues with this crime. With &lt;i&gt;Murder in Memphis&lt;/i&gt; we are ever closer to an accurate understanding of how and why Dr. King was killed." />
