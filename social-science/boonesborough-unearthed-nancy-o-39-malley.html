  <title>Boonesborough Unearthed - Nancy O&#39;Malley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Throughout the Revolutionary War, Fort Boonesborough was one of the most important and defensively crucial sites on the western frontier. It served not only as a stronghold against the British but also as a sanctuary, land office, and a potential seat of government. Originally meant to be the capital of a new American colony, Fort Boonesborough was thrust into a defensive role by the onset of the Revolutionary War. Post-Revolutionary attempts to develop a town failed and the site was abandoned. Yet Fort Boonesborough lived on in local memory. &lt;I&gt;Boonesborough Unearthed: Frontier Archaeology at a Revolutionary Fort &lt;/I&gt;is &lt;I&gt; &lt;/I&gt;the result of more than thirty years of research by archaeologist Nancy O&#39;Malley. This groundbreaking book presents new information and fresh insights about Fort Boonesborough and life in frontier Kentucky. O&#39;Malley examines the story of this historical landmark from its founding during a time of war into the nineteenth century. O&#39;Malley also delves into the lives of the settlers who lived there, and explores the Transylvania Company&#39;s dashed hopes of forming a fourteenth colony at the fort. This insightful and informative work is a fascinating exploration into Kentucky&#39;s frontier past.&lt;/P&gt;" />
