  <title>Fate of the Nation - Jakkie Cilliers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;WHAT DOES OUR FUTURE HOLD? In these uncertain times, this is the question on many South Africans&#39; lips. Will we become more prosperous and less divided as a nation or remain hugely unequal and generally poor? Will the ANC split or eventually be forced into an alliance with the EFF after 2019? Could the DA rule the country after the 2024 elections?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Fate of the Nation&lt;/i&gt; Jakkie Cilliers develops three scenarios for our immediate future and beyond: Bafana Bafana, Nation Divided and Mandela Magic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cilliers says the ANC is currently paralysed by the power struggle between what he calls the Traditionalists and the Reformers. It is this power struggle that has led to the inept leadership, policy confusion and poor service delivery that has plagued the country in recent years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Key to which scenario could become our reality is who will be elected to the ANC&#39;s top leadership at the party&#39;s national conference in December 2017. Whichever group wins there will determine what our future looks like. This is a book for all concerned South Africans.&lt;/p&gt;" />
