  <title>The Idea of Being Indians and the Making of India - George Varuggheese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book &lt;em&gt;The Idea of Being Indians and the Making of India&lt;/em&gt; is a must read for all Indians. It informs them why India is a colony of its middle class who keeps the 80 percent of the population out of the benefits of all economic planning and development. The answer is that the struggle for Indias freedom was waged by its middle-class leaders only to drive the British out of power and not to get rid of the feudal-fascist governance structures of administration, judiciary, and police, which were crushing us, according to Nehrus admission in his book &lt;em&gt;The Discovery of India&lt;/em&gt;. These crushing structures, our leaders themselves took over and had the taste of the power and pelf that flowed, and their feast still continues while the nation gets the human development ranking at 136 among 187 nations, according the latest Human Development Report released by the UNDP in March 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book narrates in lucid language that the noble and highly egalitarian missions of the Indian Republic, contained in the Preamble to the Constitution of India, could not be translated into experiential comforts for people of this country only because they were not compatible with the feudal-fascist revenue-collection-oriented structures inherited from the British.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book argues that when leaders who, after making a set of highly republican and democratically oriented development objectives for their country, adopt them as the Preamble to the Constitution of India instead of creating relevant democratic republican governance structures to implement, they deliberately pick up the regressive feudal-fascist governance structures used by the colonial government for their selfish ends. It is tantamount not only to a political scam but to a spiritual one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author gives a twelve-point &lt;em&gt;sarvodaya&lt;/em&gt; good governance model&#39; as remedy to these strategic errors of our founding fathers and for making a resurgent India with the help of the mission statements of the Indian Republic enshrined in the Preamble to the Constitution of India. The author argues that the mission statements in the Preamble to the Constitution of India contain the idea of being Indians of a healthy, prosperous, and peaceful society at total or 100 percent population level. The making of India of such a society is in the hands of the people of India, especially the youth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
