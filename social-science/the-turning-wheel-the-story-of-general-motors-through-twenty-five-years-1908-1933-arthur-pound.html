  <title>The Turning Wheel - The story of General Motors through twenty-five years 1908-1933 - Arthur Pound</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“ …GENERAL MOTORS in 1933 reached its twenty-fifth milestone. Since the founding of General Motors Company of New Jersey in 1908, the growth of the organization has contributed a unique chapter to American industrial history. From beginnings so small that its birth escaped notice in financial centers, General Motors has worked its way steadily forward to a place where its leadership in many of the most exacting branches of production and distribution is taken for granted and where it meets the public of many lands with a wide variety of merchandise and services. Scientific research, close attention to dealer and consumer needs, and constructive public policies are among the factors accounting for General Motors&#39; present strength. My acquaintance with General Motors began at its birth in 1908, and as a somewhat impartial observer of social trends I have watched its progress with keen interest ever since”
