  <title>Crushed! - Tope Fasua</title>
      <meta name="description" content="CRUSH-ED is not another whining story about the African experience, even though the title may lead in that direction. The title is really an acronym for the strategies that Africa (the sub-Saharan region in particular), must adopt if it is not to face extinction in the medium to long term. The book presents pungent, and urgent, analysis of the precarious situation that that region of Africa has found itself; a situation foisted not only by the historical facts of slave trade and colonialism (as most texts on the subject are wont to aver), but most importantly the failure of the African states themselves to properly interpret their cultures and how those clash with the ones they are trying to adopt and adapt to. 
CRUSH-ED navigates the tortuous terrain, delivering enough kicks in the belly to all stakeholders; chiefly the Africans themselves, the colonisers, the dominant cultures, the superpowers, the politicians, and not least, the author himself! This book should refresh every reader, especially those who are ready to be objective and face some inconvenient truths, about the world... about themselves." />
