  <title>For the Love of Letters - John O&#39;Connell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Remember letters? They were good, weren&#39;t they? The thrill of receiving that battered envelope with its longed-for contents - all the better for the wait... Handwritten is a celebration of letter-writing in all its guises, a showcase for the masterpieces we would all write if we had the time and inclination - the perfect thankyou letter, a riotous despatch from a far-flung location, that heartfelt declaration of love. As John O&#39;Connell shows, the best letters have much to teach us - Samuel Richardson&#39;s &#39;familiar letters&#39;; Wilfred Owen&#39;s outpourings to his mother; the schoolboy scatology of Kingsley Amis and Philip Larkin; Churchill and Clementine&#39;s reflections on the &#39;colour &amp;amp;amp; jostle of the highway&#39; they trod together; the sly observational charms of Jane Austen... In this richly entertaining book, O&#39;Connell puts forward a passionate case for the value of letter-writing in a distracted, technology-obsessed world. A properly crafted letter is something to be cherished, an act of exposure which gives shape and meaning to the chaos of life. In the words of John Donne, &#39;Sir, more than kisses, letters mingle souls;/For, thus friends absent speak.&#39;" />
