  <title>Ecocide - Franz Broswimmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&#39;Broswimmer&#39;s compelling polemic should be required reading for politicians and captains of industry everywhere... (he) points forward  to a progressive politics and economics that truly could sustain Earth&#39;s bounty while looking after its people.&#39; Charles Secrett, Director Friends of the Earth, UK.
&#39;Franz J. Broswimmer&#39;s &quot;Ecocide&quot; helps us choose to take collective responsibility. It is essential reading for anybody who cares about the future of humanity and the diversity of species–a diversity on which depend the ecological conditions for our survival. Humanity is at a cross roads–the future will either be an ecological wasteland of extinct species or a rejuvenation of ecological democracy.&#39;  Vandana Shiva
At the dawn of the 21st century, it is clear that changes of enormous ecological significance are occuring on our planet. The ozone layer is beginning to disintegrate. Since 1970 the world&#39;s forests have almost halved. A quarter of the world&#39;s fish have been depleted. We live in an age of ecocide. 70% of biologists believe the world is now in the midst of the fastest mass extinction of species in the planet&#39;s 4.5 billion-year history. Biodiversity loss is rated as a more serious environmental problem than the depletion of the ozone layer, global warming, or pollution and contamination. How have we come to  this, and what can be done to conserve our environment for the future? 
Ecocide: A Short History of the Mass Extinction of Species examines the facts behind the figures to offer a disturbing account of the ecological impact that the human species has on the planet. 
Research specialist Franz Broswimmer  shows how we are wilfully destroying our world. Highlighting important countermovements who are working for ecological democracy, this unique book is essential for anyone who cares about conserving our environment for the future." />
