  <title>The Next-To-Last American President - Shawn O&#39;Reilly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The downfall of the United States of America has been expedited by the recent election of Barack Hussein Obama. The country may not survive his regime, but giving him the benefit of the doubt, author Shawn OReilly describes him as &lt;i&gt;The Next-to-Last American President.&lt;/i&gt;
OReilly, a proud conservative who is deeply worried about Americas survival, describes a future date when the country no longer exists in this political satire that is only half joking around. He details the downfall, aftermath, and most importantly, the rebirth of the American people. 
Its still possible for the country to recover from the economic, social, and moral decay being promoted by Obama and his band of liberals. The new government, however, must resemble what the founding fathers envisioneda land that has few regulations and taxes and no violations of personal freedoms.
The end is approaching, and its time to prepare if you want to survive. Take every step necessary to ensure the well being of you and your family with &lt;i&gt;The Next-to-Last American President.&lt;/i&gt;" />
