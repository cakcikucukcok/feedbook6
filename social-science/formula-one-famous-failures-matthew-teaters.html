  <title>Formula One Famous Failures - Matthew Teaters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Created in 1950, the Formula One World Championship is the pinnacle of auto racing. The most popular form of motor sports on Earth, some of its marquee teams are known throughout the world, such as Ferrari, McLaren, and Lotus. Formula Ones glamorous outlook and incredible marketing power make one believe that it is a fantasy world of expensive machinery and super hero drivers, a dazzling array of lines and colors. But if one looks closer into the history of the world Championship, one will notice another side to Formula one, a side of failure. It is obvious that not every car can be a Lotus 49 or a Williams FW 14B. And not every engine can have the impact of a Ford Cosworth DFV or a Honda turbo, in fact very few are, but some stand out as some of Formula Ones most famous failures. What are the worst? That is certainly open to debate. Each year, for every winner, there are numerous disappointments, but this novel hopes to illustrate the fights and famines of the Grand Prix World." />
