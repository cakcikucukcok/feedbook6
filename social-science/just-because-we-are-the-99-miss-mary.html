  <title>Just Because We Are the 99% - Miss Mary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is about the year 2011and the 99%. In a rush to punish President Obama, the 99% elected more of the NO party into office in the 2010 midterms. Even after eight years of economic manipulations which resulted in our financial meltdown, the 99% decided to reward the NO party with more representatives. This book is about the end result of that vote. It is about the 99% being 100% responsible for our economic non-recovery. The 99% diluted its power and the 99% paid the price with Republican&#39;s obsession for new abortion laws and voting restrictions The promise of job creation was ignored by those elected in 2010. This is a book explaining the manipulation of the 99% and the 99% allowing that manipulation. Hopefully, at the end of this book, the 99% will finally be motivated to get past their subconscious racism, which makes the 99% vulnerable to divisive manipulation. Hopefully, the 99% will understand the need to stop dividing and unify." />
