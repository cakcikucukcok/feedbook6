  <title>If the West Falls... - Bridget S. Howe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;center&gt;If The West Falls&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;If the West Falls&lt;/i&gt; is the result of four years of research that began when the author learned that she was a target of US Government sponsored Organized Vigilante Stalking.  Her investigation into the crime that had been committed against her led her to an understanding of the crime that is being committed by the United States government against the people of this nation and the rest of the world.
The authors investigation reveals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;         The presence of a fascist underground controlling the life of this nation and the lives of American people&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;         The plans of secret societies such as the Bilderbergers, the Trilateral Commission and the Council of Foreign relations to dissolve the national sovereignty of the United States of America&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;         The influence of the occult in public institutions and the American Christian Church&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;         Crimes being committed by US governing officials being covered up by the National Security Act including the exploitation of children&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;         Exploitation of American citizens and people around the world under the Patriot Act and the Military Commissions Act&lt;/p&gt;" />
