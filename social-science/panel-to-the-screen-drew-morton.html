  <title>Panel to the Screen - Drew Morton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Over the past forty years, American film has entered into a formal interaction with the comic book. Such comic book adaptations as &lt;i&gt;Sin City&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;300&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&lt;/i&gt; have adopted components of their source materials&amp;#8217; visual style. The screen has been fractured into panels, the photographic has given way to the graphic, and the steady rhythm of cinematic time has evolved into a far more malleable element. In other words, films have begun to look like comics.&lt;p&gt;Yet, this interplay also occurs in the other direction. In order to retain cultural relevancy, comic books have begun to look like films. Frank Miller&amp;#8217;s original &lt;i&gt;Sin City&lt;/i&gt; comics are indebted to film noir while Stephen King&amp;#8217;s &lt;i&gt;The Dark Tower&lt;/i&gt; series could be a Sergio Leone spaghetti western translated onto paper. Film and comic books continuously lean on one another to reimagine their formal attributes and stylistic possibilities.&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Panel to the Screen&lt;/i&gt;, Drew Morton examines this dialogue in its intersecting and rapidly changing cultural, technological, and industrial contexts. Early on, many questioned the prospect of a &amp;#8220;low&amp;#8221; art form suited for children translating into &amp;#8220;high&amp;#8221; art material capable of drawing colossal box office takes. Now the naysayers are as quiet as the queued crowds at Comic-Cons are massive. Morton provides a nuanced account of this phenomenon by using formal analysis of the texts in a real-world context of studio budgets, grosses, and audience reception.&lt;/p&gt;" />
