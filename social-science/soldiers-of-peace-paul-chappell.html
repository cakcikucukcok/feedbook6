  <title>Soldiers of Peace - Paul Chappell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Soldiers of Peace&lt;/EM&gt;, by West Point graduate and Iraq War veteran Paul K. Chappell, is the sixth book in his seven-book &lt;EM&gt;Road to Peace&lt;/EM&gt; series.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The titles in this important series can be read in any order. All are about waging peace, ending war, the art of living, and what it means to be human. In a world where so many “solutions” deal with surface symptoms rather than the root causes of our problems, Chappell&#39;s books provide real guidance we can follow to change ourselves and change the world for the better.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In &lt;EM&gt;Soldiers of Peace&lt;/EM&gt;, Paul discusses how to wield the weapon of nonviolence with maximum force so that we can understand, confront, and heal our personal and societal wounds.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To create realistic peace we must be as well trained in waging peace as soldiers are in waging war. Chappell discusses how our misunderstanding of peace and violence originate from our misunderstanding about reality and the human condition itself.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This book offers a new paradigm in human understanding by dispelling popular myths and revealing timeless truths about the reality of struggle, rage, trauma, empathy, the limitations of violence, the power of nonviolence, and the skills needed to create lasting peace. Through the educational initiative of peace literacy and the metaphor of the constellation of peace, &lt;EM&gt;Soldiers of Peace&lt;/EM&gt; offers a practical framework so that all of us can apply this new paradigm to our daily lives, and therefore create realistic peace within our friendships, families, workplaces, communities, nations, and the entire world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In a time of increased strife and violence in our society, this book is more critically needed than ever.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
