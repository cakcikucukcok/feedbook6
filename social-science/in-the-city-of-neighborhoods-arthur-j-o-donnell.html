  <title>In the City of Neighborhoods - Arthur J. O’Donnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;It&#39;s like being in a small town right in the middle of a big city. People belong to their neighborhood first, and that neighborhood belongs to the city.&quot;-Karen Boyle, Seattle neighborhood activist.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Seattle, Washington, has earned a national reputation as a &quot;City of Neighborhoods&quot; and a place where citizens take an active role in finding solutions to the problems of urban life. The efforts of Seattle&#39;s neighborhood-based councils and not-for-profit organizations were also seen as part of a national &quot;neighborhood movement&quot; that achieved prominence in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Originally completed in 1982 as a series of radio programs exploring the history and directions of the neighborhood movement, &quot;In the City of Neighborhoods&quot; was written and produced by award-winning journalist Arthur J. O&#39;Donnell. The series also highlighted economic survival skills for non-profit organizations during an era of budget constraints.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this edition of &lt;I&gt;In the City of Neighborhoods,&lt;/I&gt; O&#39;Donnell augments his exploration of neighborhood activism with later articles covering the Not In My Back Yard (NIMBY) syndrome. This special section, called &quot;It&#39;s My Backyard, Too&quot;, provides insights into the arguments and tactics of those who oppose power plants, transmission lines and other energy developments." />
