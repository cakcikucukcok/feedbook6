  <title>Smart Cities, Smart Future - Mike Barlow, Cornelia Levy-Bencheton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are you curious about smart cities? &lt;/b&gt;You should be! By mid-century, two-thirds of us will live in cities. The world of tomorrow will be a world of cities. But will they be smart cities? Smart cities are complex blends of technologies, systems and services designed and orchestrated to help people lead productive, fulfilling, safe and happy lives.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This remarkable book is a window into our shared future. In crisp language and sharp detail, Mike Barlow and Cornelia Lévy-Bencheton explain how smart cities are powerful forces for positive change. With keen eyes and warm hearts, they invite readers to imagine the world of tomorrow, a fascinating world of connected cities and communities. They capture and convey the depth and richness of the worldwide smart city movement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Smart Cities, Smart Future&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; describes the impact of smart city projects on people in towns, cities and nations around the world. The book includes descriptions of ongoing smart city projects in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Looking Ahead to an Urban World&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;No two smart cities are alike. No one can say with certainty or precision what the term “smart city” means. There is no standard definition or common template. Today, smart cities are works in progress. They emerge from our hopes and our dreams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book provides you with the knowledge and insight you need to participate in the smart city movement. It explains how smart cities are “systems of systems” and introduces key concepts such as interoperability, open standards, resiliency, agility, adaptability and continuous improvement.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes Detailed Glossary of Terms and Essential Vocabulary&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The book includes a detailed comprehensive glossary of essential smart city terms. The glossary will become your indispensable resource as you engage more deeply with the smart city movement and become more involved in planning our common future in an urban world.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Carefully Researched and Crisply Written&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Smart Cities, Smart Future&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is carefully researched and fully documented. It includes interviews with leaders and experts in multiple disciplines essential to the development of smart cities, towns, regions, states and nations. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Written in the clean style of modern journalism, the book offers a strong and compelling narrative of a changing world. It reminds us that we are responsible for choosing our destiny and determining the shape of things to come. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The smart city movement is gaining speed and momentum.
