  <title>Feasting on the Spoils - Seth Hettena</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Randy &quot;Duke&quot; Cunningham was an ace fighter pilot and Top Gun instructor.  He came back from battle as Vietnam&#39;s most famous pilot--a Navy hero in an unpopular war.  In his political life, Cunningham was an eight-term United States representative who never lost an election.  So how did this powerful politician, one of the Vietnam War&#39;s most highly decorated pilots, become the most corrupt congressman in U.S. history?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, Cunningham shocked the nation by pleading guilty to charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, fraud, and tax evasion. A federal judge sentenced him to more than eight years in prison, the longest sentence handed down to a member of Congress in 40 years.  And even as Cunningham was led, weeping, to prison, investigators continued to uncover a deep-rooted scandal, reaching the cozy nexus between Congress and lobbyists, military contractors, the Defense Department and the upper ranks of the Central Intelligence Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cunningham&#39;s bribes were seemingly endless.  They included a yacht, a Rolls-Royce, and hundreds of thousands of dollars&#39; worth of antiques.  Defense contractors flew him aboard private chartered jets to luxury destinations, picked up the tab at expensive restaurants, and paid for his daughter&#39;s graduation party.  In total, he collected at least $2.4 million in five years, a series of acts unequaled in the long, sordid history of congressional corruption.   An ongoing investigation is even exploring allegations that prostitutes were hired by Cunningham&#39;s associates to entertain the congressman.  His corruption and that of his cohorts was a decisive factor in the 2006 elections, as Democrats retook control of the House for the first time in more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What led a man who showed such strength and resolve in battle to show such moral weakness later in life? Had he become a prisoner of greed or was he manipulated by others far more cunning than he?  What happened to Randy Cunningham?  In &lt;i&gt;Feasting on the Spoils&lt;/i&gt;, Hettena offers a probing look at deception and avarice.  He paints an unforgettable portrait of a life publicly unraveled, and of a man for whom the mysteries--and the history of fraud--only seem to deepen.&lt;/p&gt;" />
