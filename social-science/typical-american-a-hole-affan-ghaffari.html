  <title>Typical American A$$Hole - Affan Ghaffari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book unleashes years of frustration stemming from the ostensible and sheer ignorance of Americans concerning not only the outside world, but even matters apposite to their immediate vicinity. I have lived in Tallahassee, Boston, Miami, and College Station. There has been a common thread pervasive in all of these living experiences: the exposure to an increasingly decadent, desultory and vapid American culture. In geography, the concept is called placelessness. Apparently it seems like a felicitous word to describe the blase nature of an American culture that has become enslaved to the beer bottle, the boob tube, the Botox injections, the silicon breast enhancements, the marijuana, cigarette smoking, and an ecumenically gilded culture of scapegraces. So much of American culture is being diluted by adherence to political correctness and hackneyed professional standards. What ever happened to the media serving as the watchdogs of government? Now the media is more concerned with actually promoting dogs and dog-like behavior from shallow celebrities. The book attempts to compile the dilapidated schemas, illogical double standards, and slipshod behavior of Americans in a sarcastic (yet humorous) and informative (yet satirical) fashion." />
