  <title>African Americans Working Together - Levi M. Hatcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, African Americans Working Together, deals with this age-old question: When will all blacks folks stick together? It also deals with the, hows, whys, and the why nots.
One hundred and fifty-two years after the emancipation of the African slaves in the United States of America, the effects of the worse treatment of a people known to the civilized world still exist. It not only exists in the African American community but also in the white community. It is proof that Willie Lynchs teachings had far reaching effects on all of America and the world. 
This book deals with the effects of slavery on blacks in America and how we (African Americans) may escape from the stigma of Americas worse embarrassment. It also deals with how we can save our black communities and the country that we built. Furthermore, it gives a workable solution to how we African Americans can partner with one another and gain the respect we need in this twenty-first century. As you study this book, it will require a certain amount of honesty on your part." />
