  <title>Decade of Fear: Reporting from Terrorism&#39;s Grey Zone - Michelle Shephard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;Decade of Fear&lt;/I&gt; is a darkly entertaining journey through the complicated, often bizarre world of national security since 9/11.

She cruises with former CIA bosses, runs alongside protestors in the streets of Sanaa to escape fire from Yemen&amp;#8217;s security services during experience the Arab Spring, meets victims of terrorism who leave her devastated, and earns enough stamps on her Gitmo Starbucks card for a free latte. Gripping, heartbreaking and infuriating, &lt;I&gt;Decade of Fear&lt;/I&gt; broadens our understanding of a decade that was all too often described through panicked rhetoric.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
