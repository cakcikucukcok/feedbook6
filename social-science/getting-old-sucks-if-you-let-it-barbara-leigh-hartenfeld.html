  <title>Getting Old Sucks If You Let It! - Barbara Leigh Hartenfeld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I have heard before that you begin aging the minute you are born. Pretty depressing dont you think? Aging definitely has its mysteries but it also has a lot of fun surprises-little unexpected twists and turns-that happen when you least expect them and that is what makes this journey we call Life so interesting. There hopefully are a lot of years between birth and the end of life, so my dear friends, I ask that you Enjoy the Journey. Enjoy my journey as I share the wisdom and sense of humor I have been forced to develop in spite of Mother Natures attempt to try my patience every chance she gets. You will find that we women around the world are all sisters on this trip. Aging is inevitable, so why not make the best of it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my particular journey, there are so many things my mother didnt tell me! As a result, growing older has at times been an agonizing challenge so I am sharing some common sense secrets to make your journey more fun. I have injected humor throughout. After all, if you cant laugh at yourself, who can and still get away with it?&lt;/p&gt;" />
