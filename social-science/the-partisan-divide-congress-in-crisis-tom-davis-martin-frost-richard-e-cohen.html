  <title>THE PARTISAN DIVIDE: Congress in Crisis - Tom Davis, Martin Frost, Richard E. Cohen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="During their combined 40 years in Congress, Martin Frost and Tom Davis were the field generals for their respective parties, each serving two terms as chair of the Democratic and Republican House Campaign Committees, respectively. Now they have joined forces-along with columnist Richard Cohen-in an effort to save Congress from itself.  According to the authors, Congress is incapable of reforming itself without a good kick in the seat from the American public. Frost and Davis, with great insight and skill along with a wealth of anecdotes and photos, dissect the causes of legislative gridlock and offer a common-sense, bipartisan plan for making our Congress function again.  The Preface, by Pulitzer Prize finalist David Eisenhower, sets the stage for this powerful behind-the-scenes narrative that insightfully uncovers the past road to the present political gridlock-and then offers thought-provoking insights and possibilities for the way out.  A wide array of Republicans, Democrats, former presidents, and congressional colleagues, as well as many of today&#39;s most highly respected news correspondents and analysts, have come together in broad, bipartisan, consensus support for this book and its message.  The Partisan Divide: Congress in Crisis is a fascinating &quot;must-read&quot; for the historically and politically curious-as well as for every citizen of the United States!" />
