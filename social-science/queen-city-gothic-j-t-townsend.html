  <title>Queen City Gothic - J. T. Townsend</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Losing a loved one to murder is lifes ultimate tragedy. But when the killer is never captured, a familys paralyzing grief only compounds. Years pass. Pain grows. Time heals nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents, spouses, and children of the victims never find peace. Investigators continue to lie awake night after night, year after year, thinking, If only...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cold cases fascinate us because of the endless possibilities. What if Alice Hochhausler hadnt driven her daughter home from work while a strangler was running loose? What if Oda Apples wife hadnt sent him to the corner drugstore? What if Linda Bricca hadnt been so beautiful  and her husband not a workaholic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J. T. Townsend takes us on a sinister journey through thirteen cases, which took place in Cincinnati, Ohio, between 1904 and 1971. Youll meet Frances Brady, a pretty bride-to-be gunned down at her own front door. Tommy Coby, age eight, who arrived home to an empty house, and learned later his parents were lying dead in their car. Patty Rebholz, a popular cheerleader, who was bludgeoned in a neighbors backyard while walking to break up with her teenage boyfriend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do these cases have in common? A fleeting, irrational act of violence with no resolution. Somebody literally got away with murder. Each episode took place in sheer momentsbut hundreds of innocent people still remember, still mourn, and are still haunted by horrible, unbearable images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Townsends riveting accounts include never-before-published details from police files and insights from both investigators and witnesses. Finally someone has managed to put all of the pieces together. Whodunit? Well never know for surebut we can certainly make some informed, calculated guesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, on these pages, each victim returns to vibrant life, becomes as real to us as to those loved ones they left behindand still cries out for justice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
