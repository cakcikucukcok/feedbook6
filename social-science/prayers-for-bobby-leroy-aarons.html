  <title>Prayers for Bobby - Leroy Aarons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bobby Griffith was an all-American boy ...and he was gay. Faced with an irresolvable conflict-for both his family and his religion taught him that being gay was &quot;wrong&quot;-Bobby chose to take his own life. &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prayers for Bobby&lt;/em&gt;, nominated for a 1996 Lambda Literary Award, is the story of the emotional journey that led Bobby to this tragic conclusion. But it is also the story of Bobby&#39;s mother, a fearful churchgoer who first prayed that her son would be &quot;healed,&quot; then anguished over his suicide, and ultimately transformed herself into a national crusader for gay and lesbian youth. &lt;p&gt;As told through Bobby&#39;s poignant journal entries and his mother&#39;s reminiscences, &lt;em&gt;Prayers for Bobby&lt;/em&gt; is at once a moving personal story, a true profile in courage, and a call to arms to parents everywhere. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
