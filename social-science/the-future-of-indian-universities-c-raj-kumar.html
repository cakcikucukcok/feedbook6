  <title>The Future of Indian Universities - C. Raj Kumar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At a time of social, political, and economic shifts across the world, India is faced with the pivotal challenge of addressing the state of its universities. In a region that was home to the leading higher learning institutions during ancient times, the descent in the quality of higher education offered by modern India’s universities is yet to create the desired impact. To be effective, universities will need to create institutional ecosystems that are reflective of the complex and interconnected worlds their graduates will live in. India’s extraordinary demographic profile creates a compelling need for its universities to reimagine their roles. The contributors in this volume argue for fundamental reforms to bring about a renewed sense of purpose. The chapters are authored by leading scholars in the fields of law, management, educational theory, liberal arts, international relations, and science and technology, and reflect the multiple approaches necessary to address the most difficult challenges in our times. The volume provides international and comparative perspectives on higher education, and will be immensely useful in highlighting issues being faced by Indian universities." />
