  <title>People at Work - Marjorie L. DeVault</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;People at Work&lt;/B&gt; is noted sociologist Marjorie L. DeVault’s groundbreaking collection of original essays on the complexities of the modern-day workplace. By focusing on the lived experiences of the worker, not as an automaton on an assembly line, but as an embodied human of flesh and bone, these essays offer important insight on the realities of the workplace, and their effects on life at home and in communities. With contributions from some of today&amp;#8217;s top scholars, each essay is a detailed case study of a different aspect of the working world.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Compelling, lively, and sometimes chilling, the contributors address issues from disability rights to immigrant labor, welfare reforms to budget cuts, competition to personal motivations. Each one valuable on its own, the essays in &lt;B&gt;People at Work&lt;/B&gt; combine to illuminate the hurdles that workers of all backgrounds struggle with and, more broadly, the impact of change on workers&amp;#8217; lives in the new, increasingly global, economy.&lt;/P&gt;" />
