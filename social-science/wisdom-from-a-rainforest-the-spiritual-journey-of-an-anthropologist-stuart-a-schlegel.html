  <title>Wisdom from a Rainforest: The Spiritual Journey of an Anthropologist - Stuart A. Schlegel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In the early sixties, Stuart Schlegel went into a remote rainforest on the Philippine island of Mindanao as an anthropologist in search of material. What he found was a group of people whose tolerant, gentle way of life would transform his own values and beliefs profoundly. &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Wisdom from a Rainforest&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is Schlegel&amp;#39;s testament to his experience and to the Teduray people of Figel, from whom he learned such vital, lasting lessons.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Schlegel&amp;#39;s lively ethnography of the Teduray portrays how their behavior and traditions revolved around kindness and compassion for humans, animals, and the spirits sharing their worlds. Schlegel describes the Teduray&amp;#39;s remarkable legal system and their strong story-telling tradition, their elaborate cosmology, and their ritual celebrations. At the same time, Schlegel recounts his own transformation&amp;amp;mdash;how his worldview as a member of an advanced, civilized society was shaken to the core by a so-called primitive people. He begins to realize how culturally determined his own values are and to see with great clarity how much the Teduray can teach him about gender equality, tolerance for difference, generosity, and cooperation.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By turns funny, tender, and gripping, &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Wisdom from a Rainforest&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; honors the Teduray&amp;#39;s legacy and helps us see how much we can learn from a way of life so different from our own.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;" />
