  <title>The Free Voice - Ravish Kumar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;The National Project for Instilling Fear in the people has reached completion. Before the promised highways and jobs, everybody has been unfailingly given one thing&amp;mdash;fear. For every individual, fear is now the daily bread. We are all experiencing fear; it comes to us in many different forms&amp;mdash;from the moment we step out of our homes, with so many warnings ringing in our ears... It is only the lapdog media which is safe in India today. Jump into and snuggle down in the lap of authority and nobody will dare say anything to you.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a time when free expression and individual liberty in India appear to be under serious threat, Ravish Kumar is one of our bravest and most mature public voices. Few journalists today have as keen an understanding of Indian society and politics and as strong a commitment to the truth. Fewer still can match him in eloquence and integrity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this necessary book, he examines why debate and dialogue have given way to hate and intolerance in India, how elected representatives, the media and other institutions are failing us, and looks at ways to repair the damage to our democracy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
