  <title>Anti-Colonial Theory and Decolonial Praxis - George J. Sefa Dei, Meredith Lordan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are we living in a post-colonial world? A colonial one? An anti-colonial one? Lifting the veil from language and politics, &lt;EM&gt;Anti-Colonial Theory and Decolonial Praxis&lt;/EM&gt; uses case studies from around the world to explore and untangle these concepts as they relate to education. The anti-colonial prism is very much connected to the postcolonial lens but these frameworks are not the same. Building upon earlier works, this book takes up the subject of anti-colonial praxis and its specific implications—the larger questions of schooling and education in global and, particularly, Diasporic contexts. The goal is to re-theorize the anti-colonial for the decolonial projects of transforming schooling and education in a broadly defined way. Beyond explaining these ideas, this book demonstrates ways communities are engaging in praxis as a form of anti-colonial change in a wide range of locations. Incorporating case studies from various locations and Diasporic communities—including Somalia, Canada, Nigeria, Jamaica, and St. Vincent—and  provocative theoretical analyses, the book brings varied experiences of anti-colonial praxis to the reader in timely, culturally diverse, and engaging ways. This book could be used in upper undergraduate and graduate level courses in anthropology, Diaspora studies, education, environmental studies, ethnic studies, gender studies, law, multiculturalism studies, politics, social work, and sociology." />
