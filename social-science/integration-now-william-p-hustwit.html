  <title>Integration Now - William P. Hustwit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Recovering the history of an often-ignored landmark Supreme Court case, William P. Hustwit assesses the significant role that &lt;i&gt;Alexander v. Holmes&lt;/i&gt; (1969) played in integrating the South&#39;s public schools. Although &lt;i&gt;Brown v. Board of Education&lt;/i&gt; has rightly received the lion&#39;s share of historical analysis, its ambiguous language for implementation led to more than a decade of delays and resistance by local and state governments. &lt;i&gt;Alexander v. Holmes&lt;/i&gt; required &quot;integration now,&quot; and less than a year later, thousands of children were attending integrated schools. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Hustwit traces the progression of the Alexander case to show how grassroots activists in Mississippi operated hand in glove with lawyers and judges involved in the litigation. By combining a narrative of the larger legal battle surrounding the case and the story of the local activists who pressed for change, Hustwit offers an innovative, well-researched account of a definitive legal decision that reaches from the cotton fields of Holmes County to the chambers of the Supreme Court in Washington.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
