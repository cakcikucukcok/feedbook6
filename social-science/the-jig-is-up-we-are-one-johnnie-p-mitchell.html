  <title>The Jig Is Up: We Are One! - Johnnie P. Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Race and racism have played a significant
role in the rise and fall of America. In &lt;i&gt;The
Jig is Up: We Are One!&lt;/i&gt;, author and educator Johnnie P. Mitchell details how the
man-made concept of race is a hoax that is
destroying American education and presents
a plan to restart education in America.&lt;p&gt;
Based on more than twenty-five years of
research, &lt;i&gt;The Jig is Up: We Are One!:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Chronicles the history of race to justify slavery&lt;br&gt;
 Presents ten lessons of how race was
constructed&lt;br&gt;
 Shows how race has been used to take
America to greatness for the benefits of white people on the backs of blacks&lt;br&gt;
 Narrates how the jig is up and shows how Americans must face the truth of the past, present, and future&lt;br&gt;
 Invites Americans to consider a non-racial
America&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Jig is Up: We Are One! &lt;/i&gt;presents a
new paradigm for learning and delivers a call to restart education in America based on
teaching and learning and not a bell curve
standard to survive and thrive in a smart and
successful non-racial America." />
