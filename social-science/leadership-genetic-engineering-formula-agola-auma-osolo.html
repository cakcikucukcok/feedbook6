  <title>Leadership Genetic Engineering Formula: - Agola Auma-Osolo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is the omega of volume 1 titled Why Leaders Fail and Plunge the Innocent into a Sea of Agonies; hence, its justified designation as volume 2. Its purpose is to complete the marathon research expedition commenced by volume 1 (alfa) to search for the mysteries surrounding and being responsible for mans chronic failure in the art of leadership, which has consequently always plunged the innocent under a failed leader into a sea of various acute agonies throughout all generations. In this regard, this volume is an etiology and prognosis of leadership failure epidemic that has evaded recognition of every past research effort to unlock and paralyze those mysteries responsible for its existence. Using this double-edged methodology and burning ambition, the volume systematically and vigorously synthesizes the root causes of this virus into a coherent body of knowledge that has, in the end, led to formulation of a leadership genetic engineering formula viz: elite and grass root conflict vaccination, able to provide humanity with an enabling environment of a hybrid culture requisite for good governance, democracy, and prosperity for all. This formula is a function of the discovery of a similar formula formulated and used by the ancient Egyptian people (70005000 BC), which enabled them to develop into an extraordinary hybrid culture and good leadership that, in turn, led them into a nation of immense prosperity, surpassing all other nations of their generation in Asia Minor and the Mediterranean. Hence, the unique significance of the research efforts contained in this volume 2 in its capacity as a long-lived breakthrough for social sciencesand political science, in particularagainst the scourge of bad leadership to humanity. And hence, its justification as an omega of this marathon research expedition." />
