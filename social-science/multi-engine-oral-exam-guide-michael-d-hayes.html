  <title>Multi-Engine Oral Exam Guide - Michael D. Hayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Study guide to help applicants pass the required FAA Oral &amp; Practical Exam to obtain a pilot&#39;s license or advanced rating. It is like a preview of the FAA exam (or &quot;checkride&quot;), which is required by the FAA for all pilot license applicants, to be given by a checkride instructor, one-on-one with the student. Written for candidate pilots learning the basics associated with the license they seek, and for those getting ready to take their checkride, as well as licensed pilots who need a brush-up before their flight review.
The oral and practical tests are required by the FAA for obtaining pilot licenses to fly, so these Oral Exam Guide books are indispensable to students pursuing pilot licenses. Additional study questions are included at the conclusion of each chapter to further aid learning. Answers were researched using FAA documents as well as interviews with FAA examiners, and are supported by references throughout so readers know where they can go to learn more. Also includes an Applicant&#39;s Practical Test Checklist, a handy reminder sheet for what to take with you and how to prepare for the day of the oral exam and checkride. Also by Michael Hayes: Private Oral Exam Guide, Instrument Oral Exam Guide, Airline Transport Pilot Oral Exam Guide, Multi-Engine Oral Exam Guide, and Flight Instructor Oral Exam Guide." />
