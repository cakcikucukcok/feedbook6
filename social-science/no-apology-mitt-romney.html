  <title>No Apology - Mitt Romney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The #1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestseller about putting America back in the lead and building a better future from former US Presidential Candidate and 2018 Utah Senate Candidate.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;No Apology, &lt;/i&gt;Mitt Romney asserts that American strength is essential--not just for our own well-being, but for the world&#39;s. Nations such as China and a resurgent Russia threaten to overtake us on many fronts, and violent Islamism continues its dangerous rise. In the face of such challenges, America need not apologize for its liberties, but must use them wisely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need renewal: fresh ideas to cut through complicated problems and restore our strength. Creative and bold, Romney proposes solutions to restore economic vitality, create good jobs, reduce out-of-control spending on entitlements and health care, dramatically improve education, and rebuild a military battered by years of war. Most important, he calls for a new commitment to citizenship, a common cause we all share, rather than a laundry list of individual demands. Many of his solutions run counter to Republican thinking, but all have one strategic aim: to strengthen America and preserve our global leadership. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Personal and dynamically argued, &lt;i&gt;No Apology&lt;/i&gt; is a call to action by a man who cares deeply about America&#39;s history, its promise, and its future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
