  <title>The Mediated Youth Reader - Sharon R. Mazzarella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since the first book was signed almost ten years ago, the &lt;I&gt;Mediated Youth&lt;/I&gt; series has published nearly two dozen volumes, with more in process or production. This milestone provides the perfect opportunity to reflect on how the series has evolved, how it has contributed to the field, and in which direction(s) it is moving.&lt;BR&gt; The chapters reprinted in this volume have been selected to showcase the variety and diversity of topics published in the series. Grounded in cultural studies, they approach&lt;BR&gt; mediated youth through the lenses of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religion, nationality, and technology. As a whole, they paint a multi-faceted, complex, and nuanced picture of the relationship between youth and media today, and demonstrate that there is no one, singular «youth.» They remind us of the rich diversity of life experiences and media involvements of youth from a range of backgrounds, cultures, and countries.&lt;BR&gt; These chapters serve not only as a retrospective collection of scholarship published in Peter Lang’s &lt;I&gt;Mediated Youth&lt;/I&gt; book series, but also as a roadmap to the diversity of scholarship characterizing the field of youth media studies during these years." />
