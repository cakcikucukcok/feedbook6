  <title>Power, Testing, and Grounding of Electronic Systems - Jesus C. de Sosa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Starting from the basics of a power distribution system, the author explained the mechanism of how grounding noise currents arise in a facility transformer. This is followed by computer simulation of short circuit or fault currents required in sizing the interrupting capacity of a circuit breaker.  &lt;br&gt;
Chapter 3 closely examines propagation constant and characteristic impedance of a transmission line. The model of a transmission line can explain most of the electrical or electronics problems. Some of these problems include redundancy in power systems, and grounding noise voltage.  &lt;br&gt;
Often, an engineer needs to find the cause of a failure in a system. He must have, at his disposal, a systematic method of testing to find the most probable cause of failure. This book recommends the boundary approach in finding such a cause. Testing may involve characterizing a device or a signal. An example of how an unknown device may be characterized is shown in this book.  &lt;br&gt;
In this book, a grounding noise voltage is treated as a signal. It is, perhaps, the most common cause of failures in electronic systems. To illustrate an example of how a signal may be characterized and address grounding itself, Chapter 7 shows experiments on how a grounding noise voltage may be minimized. Finally, Chapter 8 is a recommended approach in designing a grounding system." />
