  <title>Augmenting Alice - Galit Ariel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Augmented Reality is fast becoming one of the most important emerging technologies, with unprecedented investment growth and interest from big tech platforms and accelerator industries. The book introduces Augmented Reality’s core concepts and potential to newbies and experts alike. It provides a ‘wide lens’ perspective of the potential, challenges and impact that the widespread implementation of Augmented Reality will bring.
Augmented Reality will most certainly become THE new platform and standard for content creation and experience generation. Its use will make it an essential resource, with a societal impact that can only be compared to the World Wide Web’s global influence. Looking at the impact of the technology as it matures into a ground-breaking platform, it goes beyond function to explore the context of the technology’s implementation – through social, commercial, and behavioural lenses. It raises a discussion about the forefront of Augmented Reality development, and what its application, and eventual impact, might mean for society in the near future. The book explores current issues already arising in the digital age, due to the implementation of emerging technologies and Augmented Reality in particular – including changing behaviours and social etiquettes, identity in the digital age, privacy and ethical concerns.
The book contains an augmented layer, which provides an interactive experience and additional information and will be updated periodically. However, the book is designed in a way that ensures a full [physical] experience without the need for anything extra." />
