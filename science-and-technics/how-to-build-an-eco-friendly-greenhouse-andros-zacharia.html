  <title>How to Build an Eco-Friendly Greenhouse - Andros Zacharia</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Producing plastic is a cheap and straight forward process, however the disposal and decomposition of such materials is cumbersome and costly. Producing plastic is harming our environment primarily due the harmful elements that comprise it.
The concept of integrating plastic within a structure in a natural setting would appear to be incompatible. However this manual for making your own greenhouse offers a fresh perspective on re-using everyday materials such as the plastic bottle to be creative.
Our in-depth guide to making an eco-friendly greenhouse is not limited to its structure. The technique adopted can be applicable to anything else that you may be interested in constructing.
The book gives you a photographic and artistic account of how this was put together. There are useful tips and recommendations to enhance your eco-project as much as possible, making it both efficient and effective.
This guide to making an ecological greenhouse can be a source of inspiration for any DIY project, encouraging others to build and tell their stories." />
