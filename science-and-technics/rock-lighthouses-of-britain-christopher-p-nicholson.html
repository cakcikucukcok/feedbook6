  <title>Rock Lighthouses of Britain - Christopher P. Nicholson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christopher Nicholson vividly describes the construction and history to the present day of some of the world’s most famous lighthouses in this classic book which has become the standard work on the subject.
It brings the story of the rock lighthouse completely up-to-date – from the day the first granite block was laid, through construction, automation, the disappearance of the lighthouse keeper, right up to the technology of today with the use of solar and wind power.
This is a joy to read with its mix of exciting text, some of the most dramatic new colour photographs of British lighthouses ever taken, a selection of beautiful, hand-coloured plans and drawings, a brand new chapter about Rockall, the most unusual rock ‘lighthouse’ of all, and a detailed appendix.
For those not intimately connected with the sea it’s almost impossible to imagine waves higher than the vessels that sail upon them smashing against half-submerged reefs that stir the whole ocean into a raging foam of white water. Man’s struggle to build a permanent and durable structure such as a lighthouse on these sites is a story that cannot fail to stir the emotions of anyone who enjoys tales of endeavour, ingenuity and dogged determination." />
