  <title>Hawking Radiation 4 - Roman Andie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Inclusions of HFFs and quantum groups characterised by quantum phases q= exp(i2pi/n) are very interesting and quantum Pascal triangle is characterised by such a phase and gives quantum variant of binomial coefficient as a result. One can imagine quantum variants for integers characterising all kinds of combinatorial objects: Do quantum variants of objects make sense in some sense? Probably some mathematicians has pondered also this question. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only few days ago I realised that in order to have &quot;quantum quantum theory&quot; as a tool to describe finite measurement resolution, it is better to have quantum variants of fermionic quantum anti-commutation relations for the induced spinors.  They have been formulated as I learned in five minutes from web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These anticommutation relations however demand 2-D space/space-time! But just the well-definedness of em charge almost-forces 2-D string world sheets! And number theoretic arguments removes the &quot;almost&quot;. In 4-D Minkowski space-time you do not get them!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In over-optimistic mood - officially allowed at morning hours - I can therefore conclude that the observation of anyons in condensed matter systems (assigned with 2-D boundaries) serves as a direct evidence for the localisation of induced spinors at 2-D surfaces and for large h_eff. I must however assume that also partonic 2-surfaces carry them- whether it is so has been an open question for a long time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
