  <title>Star Force on Human Life - Ratnam Kandasamy, Aloysius Aseervatham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Planets in the cosmos affect the lives on earth; we know that all forms of life on earth are made up of building blocks from planets around the earth. Essentially, these planets therefore exert their control, on the lives of human beings on earth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These planets send electromagnetic radiation and rays to earth, both weak and strong which demonstrates one aspect of their ability to influence lives. Human beings are continuing to understand these effects through many years of analytical work and case studies which is the basis of astrology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Humans are able to reasonably protect themselves from negative impacts of the planets and avoid unwanted effects. Meteorologists, other scientists and astrologists are not playing God; they are studying, understanding, developing and protecting humans on earth from such negative influences. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There are many areas of interest for humans; things that affect all of our lives, such as health, wealth, education, married life, childbirth and employment. Making decisions on these areas are also effected as we are using our mind, feelings and personal judgment. Planets essentially affect our mind, hence altering our abilities to make important decisions with positive or negative outcomes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When and how, the planets affect our lives can be understood to a certain extent, through the knowledge of astrology.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book does not cover all aspects of astrology to practice as an astrologer. People with limited or no knowledge of astrology trying to understand astrological jargons and predictions, will find this book useful in understanding the basics of astrology; yet, it also provides an interesting read for those who have never been previously exposed to astrology." />
