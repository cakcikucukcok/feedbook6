  <title>Green Biocatalysis - Ramesh N. Patel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Green Biocatalysis&lt;/i&gt; presents an exciting green technology that uses mild and safe processes with high regioselectivity and enantioselectivity. Bioprocesses are carried out under ambient temperature and atmospheric pressure in aqueous conditions that do not require any protection and deprotection steps to shorten the synthetic process, offering waste prevention and using renewable resources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Drawing on the knowledge of over 70 internationally renowned experts in the field of biotechnology, &lt;i&gt;Green Biocatalysis&lt;/i&gt; discusses a variety of case studies with emphases on process R&amp;D and scale-up of enzymatic processes to catalyze different types of reactions. Random and directed evolution under process conditions to generate novel highly stable and active enzymes is described at length. This book features: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;A comprehensive review of green bioprocesses and application of enzymes in preparation of key compounds for pharmaceutical, fine chemical, agrochemical, cosmetic, flavor, and fragrance industries using diverse enzymatic reactions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Discussion of the development of efficient and stable novel biocatalysts under process conditions by random and directed evolution and their applications for the development of environmentally friendly, efficient, economical, and sustainable green processes to get desired products in high yields and enantiopurity&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The most recent technological advances in enzymatic and microbial transformations and cuttingedge topics such as directed evolution by gene shuffling and enzyme engineering to improve biocatalysts&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt; With over 3000 references and 800 figures, tables, equations, and drawings, &lt;i&gt;Green Biocatalysis&lt;/i&gt; is an excellent resource for biochemists, organic chemists, medicinal chemists, chemical engineers, microbiologists, pharmaceutical chemists, and undergraduate and graduate students in the aforementioned disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;" />
