  <title>Inquiries into the Nature of Slow Money: Investing as if Food, Farms, and Fertility Mattered - Woody Tasch, Carlo Petrini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Could there ever be an alternative stock exchange dedicated to slow, small, and local? Could a million American families get their food from CSAs? What if you had to invest 50 percent of your assets within 50 miles of where you live?Such questions-at the heart of slow money-represent the first steps on our path to a new economy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inquiries into the Nature of Slow Money&lt;/em&gt; presents an essential new strategy for investing in local food systems and introduces a group of fiduciary activists who are exploring what should come after industrial finance and industrial agriculture. Theirs is a vision for investing that puts soil fertility into return-on-investment calculations and serves people and place as much at it serves industry sectors and markets.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Leading the charge is Woody Tasch-whose decades of work as a venture capitalist, foundation treasurer, and entrepreneur now shed new light on a truer, more beautiful, more prudent kind of fiduciary responsibility. He offers an alternative vision to the dusty old industrial concepts of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries when dollars, and the businesses they financed, lost their connection to place; slow money, on the other hand, is firmly rooted in the new economic, social, and environmental realities of the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inquiries into the Nature of Slow Money&lt;/em&gt; is a call to action for designing capital markets built around not extraction and consumption but preservation and restoration. Is it a movement or is it an investment strategy? Yes.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;/p&gt;" />
