  <title>Trip the Math Fantastic - Todd A Walls</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Trip the Math Fantastic, you will journey into the hearts of people who yearn to define, predict, and perhaps understand the universe, yet struggle with anxiety, shame, loneliness, and a driving desire to do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These are the heroes of Trip the Math Fantastic:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Evelyn&amp;mdash;a retired astronaut and mathematician&amp;mdash;faces horrific conditions to guide humankind&amp;rsquo;s last attempt at redemption on a journey that will outlast every earthly trace of human civilization. Her story takes place four and a half million years ago, during the first age of homo sapiens, but her legacy permeates the modern age through myths and legends, through religion and history, and out into the galaxy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Nina&amp;mdash;an eleven-year-old survivor of crustal collapse and worldwide flooding&amp;mdash;struggles desperately to preserve an ocean of knowledge for the next generation by becoming her life&amp;rsquo;s dream; a math teacher. Ever-dwindling cities of genetically engineered algae and seaweed drift on the world ocean, enduring monstrous cyclones that destroy nearly everything they touch. All Nina can hold onto is what she can remember&amp;mdash;and teach.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Clifford&amp;mdash;a down-on-his-luck physicist and mathematician&amp;mdash;discovers a way to communicate with beings in another universe, beings with knowledge of past, present, and future events across the multiverse. From a secret hiding place&amp;mdash;through an elaborate world-wide communications network and a well-endowed foundation&amp;mdash;he applies that knowledge to ease the suffering of those in need.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Moses Nebogipfel &amp;mdash; a theoretical physicist, faces a persistent alien threat and a difficult job working for a tyrannical military general. Locked away in a low-rent apartment at the end of time, he solves the greatest equation of his life, with the most ominous solution imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;" />
