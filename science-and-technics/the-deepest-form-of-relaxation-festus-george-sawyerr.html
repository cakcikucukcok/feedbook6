  <title>The Deepest Form of Relaxation - Festus George-Sawyerr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Throughout my life I have been always on the go, always looking for the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;next level. Ive never felt settled and comfortable, always setting the next&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;goal as soon as the current one nears completion and pushing myself&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;all the time. With this attitude, I felt myself under pressure most of the&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;time, and with pressure comes stress, loads of stress, and the feeling that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I never had enough time. I was burning the candle at both ends, but I&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;concluded that this was what life required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those of us who want to thrive and lead a healthy lifestyle in this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;high-pressure world of instability, confusion, constant change, and stress,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;we couldnt stand a chance if we were physically or mentally sluggish. So&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when I got to know about flotation therapy, I quickly realised that this&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;could be the natural answer to the stresses of this ever-changing world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;of ours. Regular floating can be the way to relax your tired body while&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;engaging your subconscious mind as you control your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I discovered that regular floating made me a healthier and happier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;person. I said goodbye to a stressful lifestyle as I exercised and reinforced&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;my bodys capacity for happy thoughts, healing, good sleep, creativity,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and imagination. I had lower blood pressure, easier concentration, and&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;more energy. I discovered how regular floating positively changed my life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and helped me focus on the things I want out of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The powerful technique of floating can help people, especially&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;go-getters, to achieve their goals, to become much more centred, and to&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tackle the issues and problems that life throws at them easily and calmly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Isnt true that if we approach our problems in a relaxed state, we stand a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;better chance of solving them?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So when I was called up to run one of the very first flotation centres&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in England, I was completely blown away by the difference this form of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;therapy made in my life. The experience of lying in a tank, a gravity-free&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;environment, experiencing weightlessness and proper blood circulation,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sold me on the idea of floating regularly. I thought of the millions of&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;people out there with busy lifestyles like me who could find the results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from floating regularly very helpful. I thought of people who may be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;magnesium deficient, who may be at risk of developing or already suffer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;from poor blood circulation, diabetes, arthritis, obesity, stroke, cancer,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;heart disease, fatigue, and those who may be so stressed out that they&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;cannot even sleep at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the flotation centre, I started researching flotation and the difference&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it made in peoples lives. My position at the time facilitated this research,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as I always found the time to chat with all my clients about their&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;experiences on the day to see what changes regular floating was making&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for them. What I found was that there was not enough information out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there about how this fantastic therapy can be beneficial in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so involved with the floating business that even my spare time was&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;eaten up by research on the topic, and I promised myself that as soon as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the opportunity arose, I would put pen to paper to let the world know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in depth the benefits of being present within, switching off, and being&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in solitude and seclusion while spending some time in a gravity-free,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sensory deprivation isolation tank for just an hour or a lunchtime&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;holiday.&lt;/p&gt;" />
