  <title>The Language of Reality: The Answer to Existence - Dr. Thomas Stark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The answer to existence is that existence is an eternal language, a language that solves itself, optimizes itself, perfects itself, and finally speaks to itself and tells itself exactly what it is. It is a language that becomes conscious of itself. It might seem as though humans became conscious through language, but in fact language became conscious through humans. In &quot;The Selfish Gene&quot;, Richard Dawkins wrote, &quot;We are survival machines - robot vehicles blindly programmed to preserve the selfish molecules known as genes. This is a truth which still fills me with astonishment.&quot; In fact, we are living language nodes of a living cosmic language that is using us to become conscious of itself. Because we are language beings, we create languages, and through languages we eventually arrive at the original language, the Ur Language, the language in which we ourselves are written and expressed. This is the numerical language of mathematics, the language of energy, of syntax and semantics … the language of mind." />
