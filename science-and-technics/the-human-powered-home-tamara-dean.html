      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The Human-Powered Home is a level-headed book which focuses on informing and entertaining. There is no utopian hyperbole, just useful facts and anecdotes that provide the foundation necessary to take appropriate action.

Creating one&#39;s own power is not an easy undertaking. But it can be very energizing. The bicycle is the real hero in the book. There are photos and descriptions of dozens of jury-rigged devices, built to do everything from wash clothes to make soap to power laptops. While it&#39;s a thorough guide for confident do-it-yourselfers, the book also details how pedal and treadle power can make life-changing differences globally.&quot; - Marsha Walton, Mother Nature Network&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if I could harness this energy? An unusual question for anyone putting in a long stint on a treadmill perhaps, yet human power is a very old, practical, and empowering alternative to fossil fuels.
