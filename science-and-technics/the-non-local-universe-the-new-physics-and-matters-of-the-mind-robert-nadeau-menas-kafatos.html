  <title>The Non-Local Universe: The New Physics and Matters of the Mind - Robert Nadeau, Menas Kafatos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Classical physics states that physical reality is local, or that a measurement at one point in space cannot cannot influence what occurs at another beyond a fairly short distance. Until recently this seemed like an immutable truth in nature. However, in 1997 experiments were conducted in which light particles (photons) originated under certain conditions and traveled in opposite directions to detectors located about seven miles apart. The amazing results indicated that the photons  interacted or communicated with one another instantly or in no time, leading to the revelation that physical reality is non-local--a discovery that Robert Nadeau and Menas Kafatos view as the most momentous in the history of science.   In pursuing this groundbreaking argument, the authors provide a fascinating history of developments that led to the discovery of non-locality and the sometimes heated debate between the great scientists responsible for these discoveries. What this new knowledge reveals, the authors conclude, is that the connection between mind and nature is far more intimate than we previously dared to imagine. What they offer is a revolutionary look at the implications of non-locality, implications that reach deep into that most intimate aspect of humanity--consciousness." />
