  <title>Risk Modeling, Assessment, and Management - Yacov Y. Haimes, Andrew P. Sage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Presents systems-based theory, methodology, and applications in risk modeling, assessment, and management&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This book examines risk analysis, focusing on quantifying risk and constructing probabilities for real-world decision-making, including engineering, design, technology, institutions, organizations, and policy. The author presents fundamental concepts (hierarchical holographic modeling; state space; decision analysis; multi-objective trade-off analysis) as well as advanced material (extreme events and the partitioned multi-objective risk method; multi-objective decision trees; multi-objective risk impact analysis method; guiding principles in risk analysis); avoids higher mathematics whenever possible; and reinforces the material with examples and case studies. The book will be used in systems engineering, enterprise risk management, engineering management, industrial engineering, civil engineering, and operations research.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fourth edition of &lt;i&gt;Risk Modeling, Assessment, and Management&lt;/i&gt; features:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Expanded chapters on systems-based guiding principles for risk modeling, planning, assessment, management, and communication; modeling interdependent and interconnected complex systems of systems with phantom system models; and hierarchical holographic modeling&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;An expanded appendix including a Bayesian analysis for the prediction of chemical carcinogenicity, and the Farmer’s Dilemma formulated and solved using a deterministic linear model&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Updated case studies including a new case study on sequential Pareto-optimal decisions for emergent complex systems of systems&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;A new companion website with over 200 solved exercises that feature risk analysis theories, methodologies, and application&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Risk Modeling, Assessment, and Management, Fourth Edition&lt;/i&gt;, is written for both undergraduate and graduate students in systems engineering and systems management courses. The text also serves as a resource for academic, industry, and government professionals in the fields of homeland and cyber security, healthcare, physical infrastructure systems, engineering, business, and more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
