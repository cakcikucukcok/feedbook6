  <title>The Sun (Son) Rises Above the Earth’S Aura - Frank Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My goal is to convince you, the reader, to take the time to smell the roses, witness the miracles of nature, and permit science to be your best evidence of a higher being without interfering with your current or preconceived notions about your Creator.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Your beliefs and your image of God should be left in tact, your faith reinforced by all that you see, hear, feel, and experience in a world made for you by your Creator, not likely the result of some big bang or evolutionary theory of biological evolution, but the product, the result if you will, of a mastermind who meticulously invented, designed, and cultivated the blessing we all share which is life.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, without my burdening you with volumes of verse and verbiage, let me stimulate your thought process in as few words as possible and share with you common questions, experiences, and observations. Just as the Bible rambles on without apparent literary transition, I will follow the writing style of the prophets who wrote each scriptural proverb and verse in the greatest story ever told (the Bible). Perhaps well recognize that we are all here for a reason and that we share a world that we can identify with, and somewhat comprehend, in the context of the mystery of what we understand or dont understand.&lt;/p&gt;" />
