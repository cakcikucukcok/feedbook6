  <title>Not all Sunshine and Sand 2 - Paul Rowlands</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Recounting his many hair-raising experiences as a truck driver on the Middle East run, some of them humorous, some alarming, Paul Rowlands recalls the camaraderie of the trucking fraternity. This book takes the reader on a ride through foreign lands in the cab of a long-haul lorry, providing an insider’s perspective on overland travel. A tremendous tale, in which run-ins with the locals, dramatic encounters with foreign drivers and mechanical problems seem the norm for a long-haul lorry driver. Paul Rowlands takes us into his world as a truck driver, initially around rural Suffolk and the rest of the UK, before embarking on the Middle East run. The long-distance lorry driver deals with life in the raw, with many hardships and occasional comforts: difficulties are tempered by the sheer beauty of mountain passes, lakeside stops and the generous hospitality of the people he meets. Trucking camaraderie has seen Paul through many a crisis, and he shares the belief that help is always at hand when a fellow driver is facing a problem. The new edition of this hugely popular book incorporates 72 photographs taken at the time, many of which have never been previously published. Born in The Rhondda, South Wales, Paul Rowlands’ first job was with the Civil Service, but his love for travel led to his becoming a long-distance truck driver. Paul lives in Ipswich, Suffolk and continues to work as a truck driver/roadie." />
