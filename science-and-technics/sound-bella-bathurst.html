  <title>Sound - Bella Bathurst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Bathurst is a restless, curious writer&amp;hellip; After reading this book, I found myself listening in a richer and more interested way.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A profound, beautifully written exploration of sound by a young woman who lost her hearing, then regained it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this surprising and moving book, award-winning writer Bella Bathurst shares the extraordinary true story of how she lost her hearing and eventually regained it and what she learned from her twelve years of deafness. Diving into a wide-ranging exploration of silence and noise, she interviews psychologists, ear surgeons, and professors to uncover fascinating insights about the science of sound. But she also speaks with ordinary people who are deaf or have lost their hearing, including musicians, war veterans, and factory workers, to offer a perceptive, thought-provoking look at what sound means to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If sight gives us the world, then hearing—or our ability to listen—gives us our connections with other people. But, as this smart, funny, and profoundly honest examination reveals, our relationship with sound is both more personal and far more complex than we might expect.&lt;/p&gt;" />
