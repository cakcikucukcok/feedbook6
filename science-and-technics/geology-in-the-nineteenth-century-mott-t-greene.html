  <title>Geology in the Nineteenth Century - Mott T. Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this clear and comprehensive introduction to developments in geological theory during the nineteenth century, Mott T. Greene asserts that the standard accounts of nineteenth-century geology, which dwell on the work of Anglo-American scientists, have obscured the important contributions of Continental geologists; he balances this traditional emphasis with a close study of the innovations of the French, German, Austro-Hungarian, and Swiss geologists whose comprehensive theory of earth history actually dominated geological thought of the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Greene&#39;s account of the Continental scientists places the history of geology in a new light: it demonstrates that scientific interest in the late nineteenth century shifted from uniform and steady processes to periodic and cyclic events—rather than the other way around, as the Anglo-American view has represented it. He also puts continental drift theory in its context, showing that it was not a revolutionary idea but one that emerged naturally from the Continental geologists&#39; foremost subject of study-the origin of mountains, oceans, and continents.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A careful inquiry into the nature of geology as a field poised between natural history and physical science, &lt;em&gt;Geology in the Nineteenth Century&lt;/em&gt; will interest students and scholars of geology, geophysics, and geography as well as intellectual historians and historians of science.&lt;/p&gt;" />
