  <title>Dialectics - Paul Johnsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dialectics teaches the rules, procedures, and codes used by a technologically advanced overseer, or god, to write a program for Earth and its inhabitants. According to Johnsen, this program was designed to last for 2707 years, beginning in 687 BC and ending in 2020. The aim of Dialectics is to prove the existence of a Master Programmer through intelligently designed puzzles. Dialectics demonstrates how the speed of light, Plancks constant, and a formula for anti gravity determine the rotation and position of the Earth and its surrounding planets. It shows the simultaneous planning of the Hebrew, Christian, and Islamic calendar reforms before 378 BC, the planned height and fall of the Roman Empire, the entanglement of emperors living 700 years apart, a Christian conspiracy headed by Dante, and the identity of Shakespeare. These and many more startling revelations are found in Dialectics, including the 1929 stock market crash, the 9/11 attack of the twin towers, and the economic meltdown of 2008. By proving the existence of God and his (or her) continuous interaction with people and events of this world, Dialectics gives the Darwinists some viable competition." />
