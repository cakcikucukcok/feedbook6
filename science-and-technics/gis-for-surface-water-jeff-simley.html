  <title>GIS for Surface Water - Jeff Simley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;GIS for Surface Water: Using the National Hydrography Dataset&lt;/em&gt; enables scientists, managers, and students to understand the complexities of the vital surface waters of the United States. It triggers exploration and analysis by combining the ready-to-use powers of a comprehensive database of the nation’s waters and the ArcGIS® platform for geographic data analysis and mapping. This book explains how the water that exists on the landscape has been translated into a computer database, and how data about the water, such as chemistry and fish habitat, is linked to this database. Elevation data is also incorporated to produce watersheds at the
micro and macro levels. This information, along with climatic data, leads to the creation of water flow and velocity estimates for every segment of the 7.5-million-mile drainage network in the United States. With the development of this complete water information system, the reader is poised to generate new knowledge about the behavior of surface-water systems.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Application of the ArcGIS suite of geographic and network analysis tools makes the science of surface water come to life. GIS for Surface Water vividly demonstrates how the vast capabilities of ArcGIS can be easily applied to the National Hydrography Dataset and
companion Watershed Boundary Dataset to reveal the intricate properties of complex water networks. A variety of GIS operations are made simpler using ArcGIS. You will be able to input the National Hydrography Dataset in your GIS and trace the path of water within
minutes. With just a little more effort, you will be able to create enlightening flow-volume maps showing how much water flows through any given river system. By following basic principles outlined in the book, you will discover that these methods also apply to the science of surface-water systems for any nation. User stories by experienced water analysts are also included to buoy your knowledge of GIS for surface water." />
