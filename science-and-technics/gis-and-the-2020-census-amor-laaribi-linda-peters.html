  <title>GIS and the 2020 Census - Amor Laaribi, Linda Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;em&gt;GIS and the 2020 Census: Modernizing Official Statistics&lt;/em&gt; aims to provide statistical organizations with the most recent methodologies and technological tools to support the user needs at all the stages of a Census during the 2020 Round of Censuses. &lt;br/&gt;
More specifically, the handbook focuses on planning your work with GIS, use of new technologies including; cloud computing, Location as a Service (LaaS)  as well as emerging data sources. It will stress the use of geospatial tools during enumeration, including field data collection and operations management, as well as the the need to look at the finest level geography possible (dwelling and unit level) and how to capture information at that level with mobile and geospatial-based technology. &lt;br/&gt;
Furthermore, the it will respond to the growing post-census needs for statistical data analysis, integration and dissemination, with innovative solutions. While centered on the use of GIS and other geospatial technology in support of census operations, it offers guidelines on the basic foundations for building a statistical-geospatial information infrastructure in support of the 2020 Round of Censuses, evidence-based decision making and sustainable development.  The book is supported with case studies illustrating these concepts in practice." />
