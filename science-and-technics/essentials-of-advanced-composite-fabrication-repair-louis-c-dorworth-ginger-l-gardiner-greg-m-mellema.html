  <title>Essentials of Advanced Composite Fabrication &amp; Repair - Louis C. Dorworth, Ginger L. Gardiner, Greg M. Mellema</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;This is the Ebook (epub) Edition of this title.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Advanced composite technology is crucial to aerospace and aviation applications, as well as many other industries, because of the advantage of composite materials: their properties of strength and stiffness combined with their light weight. It is a constantly changing field with new developments daily, yet the basics needed to successfully design, fabricate and repair composite structures remain the same. Essentials of Advanced Composite Fabrication and Repair is a comprehensive and thorough primer for beginners to this technology, yet also works as an excellent resource for long-time composites professionals.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This textbook teaches the concepts and methods in a simple and straightforward manner for a wide array of composites fundamentals, including fiber and matrix selection, curing and achieving desired properties, tooling design and use, testing and nondestructive inspection, step-by-step repair instructions and troubleshooting, and also covering the key environmental, health and safety issues that affect the industry.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Authors Louis C. Dorworth, Ginger L. Gardiner, and Greg M. Mellema have over 80 combined years&#39; experience in the industry. Along with numerous everyday practical lessons garnered from their combined lifetime of experience, the authors have created in this textbook a compendium of industry information listings no longer in print. Some examples include fabric weave styles and properties, cored sandwich design guidelines, damage detection, fiber reinforcement properties, and much more. In-depth step-by-step explanations of composite repairs are detailed, including troubleshooting and the &quot;why&quot; behind what works in composites design, fabrication and repair.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
