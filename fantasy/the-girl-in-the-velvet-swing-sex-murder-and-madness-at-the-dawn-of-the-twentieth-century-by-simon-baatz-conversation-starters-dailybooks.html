&lt;br /&gt;
The Girl on the Velvet Swing is the latest history and true crime novel written by Simon Baatz. Evelyn Nesbit was a sixteen-year-old girl who found herself working in New York City as a model and chorus girl. Her first role as a chorus girl was in the musical Florodora. Evelyn was noticed by Stanford White, a prominent architect in the city. Left in the care of Stanford while her mother was out of town, Stanford got Evelyn drunk on champagne until she lost consciousness. When Evelyn awoke next to Stanford, she realized that he had raped her. Evelyn kept this event to herself until she told the man who would become her husband, Harry Thaw.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The Wall Street Journal wrote in their review of The Girl on the Velvet Swing that was a fast moving tale that will captivate readers from the first page.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
