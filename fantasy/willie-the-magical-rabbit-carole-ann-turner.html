  <title>Willie the Magical Rabbit - Carole Ann Turner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Little girl Dollie is playing in the woods when she witnesses something quite strange and mysterious. There is a grand crash, but she cant be sure what fell from the sky. She runs home to seek the help of her mother who thinks its a good idea to call the sheriff. As a group, they return to the forest but find nothingno sign of a crash at all.
Dollie knows what she saw though. Something fell to earth, and shes going to find out what. A few days later, she returns to the scene. She sits on a log and waits, eventually calling out to see if anyone might answer. Her voice reveals a set of tiny ears sticking up out of the leaves, and with a careful approach, Dollie discovers a small rabbit.
This rabbit, though, is unlike any shes ever seen. He has strange ears, his name is Willie, and he appears to be an alien from outer space whose spaceship unfortunately crashed. Willie is whip smart and clever. He soon takes Dollie, her mother, and their friends on an unforgettable adventure that is truly out of this world!" />
