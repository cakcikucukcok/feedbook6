  <title>Joshua&#39;s Key - H Brading</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine being spirited away in the middle of the night and waking up on a ship in the middle of the ocean, that didnt bother Joshua, he was a Seaton, he had grown up in the ocean, after all he had gills behind his ears and could breath underwater.
What bothered Joshua was the giant rock man called Cragos, 
How could rocks talk? Never mind stand up?
He didn&#39;t really understand the warrior women of Hen Coed,
Why did they dislike him so much?
Why were they always cranky?
These women wanted to go to Morfa where the Seaton Elders lived
Even the Seatons themselves didn&#39;t want to go down there, the Elders were up tight,
How did these women expect to get to Morfa? They couldnt breath underwater,
and now there was a Key and a Garden that shone light all year round, all day, every day, not to mention a phrophecy.
A Darkness was coming, threatening to destroy the earth and everyone on it.
So why had Joshua agreed to help find this Key and vanquish the Darkness?
Maybe it was the Sheetrea he had just drunk, or that the Hen Coed warrior women were bloody scary!
Either way, he was signed up to save the world,
Well he had Minga his loyal aquadine, not to mention his father Raymond,
What could possibly go wrong?" />
