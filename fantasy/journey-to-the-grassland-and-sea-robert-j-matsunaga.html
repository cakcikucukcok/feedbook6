  <title>Journey to the Grassland and Sea - Robert j. Matsunaga</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tenashar, a young member of the Senetha tribe, has made it his lifes mission to find out why his ancient world is dying. After traveling into the future, he returns back to his own time a changed manone who has discovered his hidden abilities and learned much about other worlds. Now he is more determined than ever to find out why biological machines known as the Orbs are depleting the life force from his land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenashar bids farewell to the friends who accompanied him on his last journey and sets out across the grasslands, trudging for days in search of answers that will save his people and his world from destruction. Led by two silent guardians, Tenashar seeks the truth in odd flying ships, from a villager who tells him of strange things, and from warriors who fight their own battles with the Orbs. But it is only after he finds refuge in ruins and is rescued by a ghost girl that Tenashar is propelled on a new voyage across the rough seas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this continuing saga, a man pursuing resolution for his beloved tribe will soon discover the reason for his life-altering journey as his world slowly transforms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
