  <title>Deadmen Walking - Sherrilyn Kenyon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;#1 &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Sherrilyn Kenyon debuts a sweeping new epic saga sure to appeal to her millions of fans!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deadmen tell their tales . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To catch evil, it takes evil.  Enter Devyl Bane- an ancient dark warlord returned to the human realm as  one of the most notorious pirates in the New World. A man of many  secrets, Bane makes a pact with Thorn- an immortal charged with securing  the worst creations the ancient gods ever released into our world.  Those powers have been imprisoned for eons behind enchanted gates . . .  gates that are beginning to buckle. At Thorn&#39;s behest, Bane takes  command of a crew of Deadmen and, together, they are humanity&#39;s last  hope to restore the gates and return the damned to their hell realms.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But  things are never so simple. And one of Bane&#39;s biggest problems is the  ship they sail upon. For the Sea Witch isn&#39;t just a vessel, she&#39;s also a  woman born of an ancient people he wronged and who in turn wronged him  during a centuries long war between their two races-- a woman who is also  sister to their primary target. Now Marcelina, the Sea Witch, must  choose. Either she remains loyal to her evil sister and almost extinct  race against Bane and his cause, and watches humanity fall, or she puts  faith in an enemy who has already betrayed her. Her people over the  totality of humanity-- let&#39;s hope Bane can sway her favor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Deadmen Walking&lt;/i&gt; is the first historical fantasy title in &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Sherrilyn Kenyon&#39;s Deadman&#39;s Cross series. It is a tale of passion and loss, emotions that wound and heal...and ultimate redemption&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
