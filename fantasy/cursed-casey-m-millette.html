  <title>Cursed - Casey M. Millette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A war rages between kings and clans for centuries, their nations split and their kingdoms fallen. Caught in the midst of poverty and bedlam, twenty-year-old Aldor faces a choice. Should he leave home and start his life anew, or stay and protect what little he has?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aldor has only made one friend in his life and has never seen a legendary creature before. As soon as he steps beyond his door, he finds himself an outlaw, hunted by creatures of pure fantasy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Forced into joining a team of misfits in a race to recover a sacred, lost stone, Aldor finds unexpected friendships and adventure. But just as things start to look promising, disaster strikes, wielding the unexpected and the terrifying!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Aldor&amp;#39;s life will never be the same as he struggles with true feelings of fear, loss, love, and suffering for the very first time." />
