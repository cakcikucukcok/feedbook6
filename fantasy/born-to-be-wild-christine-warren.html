  <title>Born To Be Wild - Christine Warren</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Josie Barrett brings out the animal in men. Literally. As the local veterinarian in a town that&#39;s approximately seventy percent Others--mostly shapeshifters--Josie deals with beastly situations all the time. It&#39;s practically part of her job description. But when the werewolves of Stone Creek, Oregon, start turning downright feral, Josie smells a rat--among other, more dangerous critter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teaming up with the ferociously sexy Eli Pace, a full-time sheriff and part-time were-lion, Josie tries to contain the shapeshifting problem before it spreads like a virus. But when more shifters get infected--and stuck in their animal forms--the fur really begins to fly. Josie and Eli have to find the cause, fast, before the whole town goes to the dogs. But first, they have to wrestle with a few animal urges of their own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
