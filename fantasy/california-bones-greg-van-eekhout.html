  <title>California Bones - Greg Van Eekhout</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Daniel Blackland was six, he ingested his first bone fragment, a bit of kraken spine plucked out of the sand during a visit with his demanding, brilliant, and powerful magician father, Sebastian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Daniel was twelve, he watched Sebastian die at the hands of the Hierarch of Southern California, devoured for the heightened magic layered deep within his bones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, years later, Daniel is a petty thief with a forged identity. Hiding amid the crowds in Los Angeles--the capital of the Kingdom of Southern California--Daniel is trying to go straight. But his crime-boss uncle has a heist he wants Daniel to perform: break into the Hierarch&#39;s storehouse of magical artifacts and retrieve Sebastian&#39;s sword, an object of untold power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this dangerous mission, Daniel will need a team he can rely on, so he brings in his closest friends from his years in the criminal world. There&#39;s Moth, who can take a bullet and heal in mere minutes. Jo Alverado, illusionist. The multitalented Cassandra, Daniel&#39;s ex. And, new to them all, the enigmatic, knowledgeable Emma, with her British accent and her own grudge against the powers-that-be. The stakes are high, and the stage is set for a showdown that might just break the magic that protects a long-corrupt regime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extravagant and yet moving, Greg van Eekhout&#39;s &lt;i&gt;California Bones&lt;/i&gt; is an epic adventure set in a city of canals and secrets and casual brutality--different from the world we know, yet familiar and true.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
