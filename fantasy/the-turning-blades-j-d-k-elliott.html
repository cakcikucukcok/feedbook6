  <title>The Turning Blades - J.D.K. Elliott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A shadow hangs over the lands of Kosma誰a, as years of hard won peace are threatened by something sinister in the Desch Mountains. Unable to convince world leaders to respond to the threat without proof, hardened warrior Kaiden is forced to put together a group of elite warriors to enter the mountains to determine the danger that waits there. Twists and turns will lead this group of warriors down paths that lead to dangers that they could never have imagined, and an evil that surpassed Kaiden&#39;s greatest fears. Josh Elliott was born and raised in the small, largely forgotten province of New Brunswick, but now lives in the bustling metropolis of Picton Ontario (look it up if you don&#39;t get the joke.) Josh fell in love with fiction at a young age, and has refused to grow up since. He&#39;s a new comer to the world of finishing novels, but a lifelong writer at heart. He enjoys comic books, punk rock music, epic fantasy and long walks on the beach." />
