  <title>Doing Justice: A Prosecutor&#39;s Thoughts on Crime, Punishment, and the Rule of Law by Preet Bharara | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Doing Justice: A Prosecutor&amp;#39;s Thoughts on Crime, Punishment, and the Rule of Law by&amp;nbsp;Preet Bharara&amp;nbsp;| Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After many years of observing and participating in the legal system, making efforts to improve on it, and prosecuting those who try to defy it, US Attorney Preet Bharara writes a book about his legal work. He asserts that as American citizens, people must work to protect the rule of law. They also need to accept the flaws inherent in the system because it is humans who make it work. The New York Journal of Books says the book is essential reading for Americans. It comes at a time when the ideals of truth and justice are under attack.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Doing Justice is the first book of Preet Bharara, the former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. He currently teaches at the New York University School of Law and hosts the podcast Stay Tuned with Preet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Create Hours of Conversation:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Foster&lt;/b&gt; a deeper understanding of the book&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Promote&lt;/b&gt; an atmosphere of discussion for groups&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; &lt;b&gt;Assist &lt;/b&gt;in the study of the book, either individually or corporately&lt;br /&gt;
