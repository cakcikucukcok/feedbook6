  <title>Refuge - Jason K Macomson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While visiting a reclusive aunt in the mountains of Western Maine, Carol is stranded at night on a desolate road after an automobile accident.  When she sets out alone to search for help, she finds herself stalked by vampires and then rescued by an unlikely pair of vampire hunters.  Eric and Will are not what they seem at first, though, and Carol is unsure if they are really her heroes or if something more sinister lies behind their actions.  Over the next three days, the trio is forced on the run from murderous vampires, and Carol slowly learns the truth about both Will and Eric.  Questioning everything she thought she ever knew about the nature of good and evil, Carol must confront difficult questions about the existence of God and where she will spend eternity.  When she is captured by the local vampire coven, she faces a life and death choice, and Will and Eric must risk everything in an attempt to save her life." />
