  <title>The Bounty - Holding On (Book 5): Dystopian Romance Series - Third Cousins, Kacey Lu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sarah knows that the guards are out looking for her. She knows that it&#39;s only a matter of time before they catch up, and that when they do, she might not be able to fight them all off. Natasha is close to finishing the device which will disconnect all the chips, but it&#39;s missing one vital piece. Will she be able to find it before it&#39;s too late? Nathan thought he was going to escape from the bunker. That was before Bella stopped him. Now he&#39;s stuck. The only contact with the outside world he can have is through monitoring people&#39;s chips. He tries to find comfort in watching over Sarah, but when he realizes that she&#39;s being attacked, he realizes that sitting on the sidelines is something he just can&#39;t do." />
