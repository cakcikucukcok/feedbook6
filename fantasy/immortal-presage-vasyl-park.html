  <title>Immortal Presage - Vasyl Park</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What are memories to us that live and die; Is it joy, pain, regret, hope, pride, hatred. Do those memories become the things we cherish for a lifetime? If the mind forgets does our heart remember? All these things wrapped in emotions and feelings; do these memories make us mortal, do they make us human?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world of legends, where religion, science, and magic meld together, there are those who live their lives as well as they can, holding on to their memories and allowing their feelings to guide and move them toward a better future through life and into death. And then there are those whose lives are unending, everlasting, and unchangingthe Amara the Immortals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four lives have begun to move along a path bound to the fate of every immortal. Although their lives cannot be given up or taken, they move according to a destinya cursethat was left behind by those of the past many centuries ago. A prophecy has foretold the deaths of the deathless, but who or what could bring an end to the Immortals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this novel, the immortals must face the possibility of extinction as the events of an ancient prophesy begin to unfold.&lt;/p&gt;" />
