  <title>Cally and Missy: the Fairy Tale Continues; - M Missy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Well! Another month of my life went by and there was much more excitement than I would have preferred. However, there was much more sissy maid home time that I find so relaxing as well, so it was more balanced this past month.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Milly spent several Friday nights at Miss Ts home being trained to be a better sissy maid. I can tell you that Miss T did a wonderful job with milly. Milly is a much better maid and she looks so much more feminine. Milly enjoyed the training and is enjoying herself more as Mollys sissy maid, as well as, when she fills in for Sabrina as the homes common area sissy maid. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cally and I had an interesting and almost funny kidnapping case to solve. That only took an afternoon and a morning and had a conclusion that neither Cally nor I saw coming, but we were close and had the right idea. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cally, Ally, Mindy, and I had the most unusual birthday you could possibly imagine. Everyone seemed to have a good time except me as I did not care for the attention. However, I was a birthday to remember as it was like no other in the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I was spanked twice this month, once at home in front of some strangers that I found extremely humiliating. The second time, it was for losing a tennis match. That spanking also was in front of strangers which also made it very humiliating. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The Management company is doing very well. However, there was an internal problem that Cally needed to straighten out and Cally straightened it out the way she usually straightens out problems with someone getting a very humiliating spanking. It was not me this time. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cally and I had the most wonderful tennis vacation. It was the first time for over three years that Cally and I had some alone time together. We played in a tennis tournament and did a lot of fun things. I was able to have all the sex I wanted from Cally for the VERY FIRST TIME. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I also saved the lives of three people and Cally and I had to run away from the press twice as we did not want the publicity. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The other day, Cally was contacted by Lloyds of London looking for our help with another professional sex slave kidnapping ring. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Cally and I would need to go to Bolivia and get inside the kidnapping ring to figure out all the pieces. It sounded both interesting and dangerous. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I will tell you all about it when we get home. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Last; Ally brings home a great looking Dominate ALPA male which started to change the entire makeup of the home; which was that of Dominate females, who were now melting to the stronger Dominate ALPA male. That may be a problem as Cally is not liking it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Until then, thank you for following my unusual fairy tale life." />
