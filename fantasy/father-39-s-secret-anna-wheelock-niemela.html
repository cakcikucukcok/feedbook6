The brothers do not know of their relationship until their father&amp;rsquo;s deathbed confession. Jonathan seeks a father&amp;rsquo;s love but follows his father&amp;rsquo;s path of deceit. As a lawyer, he seeks revenge on his father for causing his illegitimate birth to his retarded mother. Jonathan, raised by Christian grandparents, rebels against God until he falls in love with his Christian secretary, Sharon. David lives with his father and mother, but guilt and alcohol destroy their marriage. A friend, Sharon&amp;rsquo;s brother Robert, introduces David to Christ. It takes a while for David and Jonathan to become brothers. They must seek forgiveness and accept their Heavenly Father&amp;rsquo;s love and hope for a better future.&lt;/p&gt;" />
