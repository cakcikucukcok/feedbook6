  <title>The Apprentice Boy Part Ii - Luke Okoli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This Book, The Apprentice Boy Part II, is the continuation of The Apprentice Boy Part I. You probably have read The Apprentice Boy Part I. The Apprentice Boy is an African story of a Nigerian boy born in a poor family without any future. His father died after he fell from height, and there was no one to pay his schools fees. He loved to go to school, but his mother could not afford to send him to school. Eventually he managed to attain a high level of education through self-effort and hardwork. There were many obstacles on his way as he wrestled with life. The climax of his woes came when he was captured by some barbaric natives who needed human heads for a sacrificial burial for a dead King. 
While Part I of The apprentice Boy narrated the boys life from age 4 up to age 22, when he was captured by barbaric natives, Part II narrated what happened to the young man in his captivity. 
The book is rich with Nigerian (African) legend, idioms, and figurative speech. It is excellent for improving the knowledge of English language, especially for English learners. The Book is also excellent for English Literature text book in High Schools and Universities." />
