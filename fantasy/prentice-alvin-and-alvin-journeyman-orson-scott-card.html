But Alvin must also learn to control and use his own talent, that of a Maker, else his destiny will be unfulfilled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alvin Journeyman&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Alvin is a Maker, the first to be born in a century.

For Alvin has had a vision of the Crystal City he will build, and he knows that he cannot build it alone. But he has left behind in Hatrack River enemies as well as true friends. His ancient foe, the Unmaker, whose cruel whispers and deadly plots have threatened Alvin&#39;s life at every turn, has found new hands to do his work of destruction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
