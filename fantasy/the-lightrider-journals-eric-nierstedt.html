  <title>The Lightrider Journals - Eric Nierstedt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Joseph Hashimoto is happy with his ordinary life. A man who believes in fairness and just action, Joes greatest love is his family. But as he moves about his days, he is completely unaware that his actions are carefully observed. With one momentous decision, Joes ordinary life is about to transform into an extraordinary existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While attempting to save a little girl from danger, Joe is killed in a violent explosion. Instead of dying, however, his soul is brought before the elemental Architects of the Universe, who tell him he has been chosen for a sacred duty. Reborn as Lightrider, the earthly representative of Light, Joe is given leadership of the Elemental Knights, a group of half-man, half-animal beings. Charged with maintaining a delicate balance between good and evil, Joe must police both sides and destroy anyone who threatens to ruin it. As Joe struggles with his conflicting emotions and longing for home, he must face his greatest threatthe ancient Chaos Demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this fantasy tale, a man inadvertently thrust into a world of cosmic forces must come to terms with change and accept what needs to be done for the good of all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
