  <title>The Howl of the Whisperers - Patricia E. Peterson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This fictional novel parallels a story from World War II, a saga based on a band of Navajo Marines called the True Whisperers. In this present era there is a small band of select women and men called ATA agents-Whisperers, hired by the President of the United States. These select agents come from different international organizations, each bringing unique skills to decipher anything within the global cyber network. What they uncover are encrypted plans by a new Al Qaeda terror group founded by their leader, Abu Bakr. Under the Presidents command, their charge is to reveal the heinous plot of terror directed against the USA by Abu Bakr. For years this Al Qaeda group has secretly developed home grown terrorist cells within the USA working toward their final goal-an unprecedented attack within our contiguous borders using a lethal toxin. As leads and clues unfold in different parts of the world, these agents follow the cyber footprints to reveal the target sights. Each ATA agent brings individual personal reasons for taking this job that adds intrigue to pique the readers interest to unravel how their lives are caught up in this plot. It was fortuitous reality that an unparalleled event happened May 2, 2011 to mirror the actions and machinations within this fictional sagas plot filled with twists and turns. As with historys True Whisperers the American people will never hear about the heroic heights these few men and women reach to preserve our Freedoms. The Howl of the Whisperers...is silence." />
