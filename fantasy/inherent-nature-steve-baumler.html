      <meta name="description" content="Nature vs. nurture.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What would happen if the soul of a good person was suddenly shoved into the body of an inherently evil creature? Could it survive?
&lt;br&gt;
This is the situation in which Morgan Mclain has found himself. Morgan is a newly commissioned knight of The Dun Lian Brotherhood and while traveling the countryside spreading the good will of The Brotherhood, Morgan encounters a
magical gem that thrusts his soul into the body of a troll.  Can he maintain his sanity while trying to deal with the savage nature of the urges that now work their way into his thoughts?  Can he curb the desire to kill or will the primal nature of his new body overpower the years of training he received as a Dun Lian Knight? Will his god aid him in his quest to regain his own body or abandon him to the malicious nature of his new form? new form?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Meanwhile, Malchom Jamias, a wizard whose soul was trapped within the gem for hundreds of years is released into Morgans body and embarks on a killing spree aimed at regaining the attention of his evil god Altair. Only by sacrificing the lives of hundreds can Malchom hope to regain his former power and standing in Altairs eyes. Can he accomplish this before The Brotherhood catches up with him?" />
