  <title>Pirate&#39;s Alley - Suzanne Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;After vanquishing undead serial killers and discovering the dark secrets of her family history, wizard sentinel DJ Jaco must now stop the coming preternatural war in Suzanne Johnson&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Pirate&#39;s Alley.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wizard sentinel DJ Jaco thought she had gotten used to the chaos of her life in post-Katrina New Orleans, but a new threat is looming, one that will test every relationship she holds dear. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caught in the middle of a rising struggle between the major powers in the supernatural world--the Wizards, Elves, Vampires and the Fae--DJ finds her loyalties torn and her mettle tested in matters both professional and personal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her relationship with enforcer Alex Warin is shaky, her non-husband Quince Randolph is growing more powerful, and her best friend Eugenie has a bombshell that could blow everything to Elfheim and back. And that&#39;s before the French pirate Jean Lafitte, newly revived from his latest &quot;death,&quot; returns to New Orleans with vengeance on his mind. DJ&#39;s assignment? Keep the sexy leader of the historical undead out of trouble. Good luck with that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Duty clashes with love, loyalty with deception, and friendship with responsibility as DJ navigates passion and politics in the murky waters of a New Orleans caught in the grips of a brutal winter that might have nothing to do with Mother Nature. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;War could be brewing, and DJ will be forced to take a stand. But choosing sides won&#39;t be that easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
