  <title>Prophet to the Outerlands - Wm. Matthew Graphman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On their way to meet up with an ancient dragon, Guntharr, Taya, Firebane and the others encounter a group of elves taken captive by a small army of barbarians.  Concerned for their possible allies, Guntharr breaks away from the group to try and discover what fate would befall them. Firebane, now in charge, must lead the others without the help of Rift, through a dangerous dungeon in order to recover a coveted treasure that their dragon host requires to secure an audience with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compelled by a longing to return home and a fear that his life is nearing an end, Rift journeys back to Wolf Valley to spend his last days among his family. His warm welcome is cut short when Rift discovers that his oldest son has been missing for weeks, presumably out searching for him. As a result, his youngest has been trying to hold things together with the council of wolves and Rifts return sparks a controversy which ends with his arrest and subsequent trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Rift stands to defend himself, Raskin risks his life and makes a historic appearance in the middle of wolf territory. Alerted to the fact that Guntharr and the others are in deep trouble, Rift is forced to accept banishment from Wolf Valley. Recruiting his family, Rift follows his feathered friend into the wilderness to a long forgotten fortress. There, Firebane and the others are lured into a trap and captured by none other than Guntharr who is now under the control of an evil enchantress. Mastering the power of the green gem, the enchantress, at the request of her sister Naranda, returns a certain wizard back to life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Guntharr now under the sway of the enchantress, Firebanes faith and courage is taxed to the limit. Not only must he battle the persuasive power of the enchantress, but hope against all hope that he can find a way to free them all and recover the next piece to the Talisman of Alterian before all is lost.&lt;/p&gt;" />
