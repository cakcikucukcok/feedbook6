  <title>Till The World Ends: Dawn of Eden / Thistle &amp; Thorne / Sun Storm (Luna) - Julie Kagawa, Ann Aguirre, Karen Duvall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Imagine what it takes to survive in a world where everything you know— and love—is about to disappear…forever.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;DAWN OF EDEN BY JULIE KAGAWA &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Before The Immortal Rules, there was Red Lung, a relentless virus determined to take out all in its path. For Kylie, the miracle of her survival is also her burden—as a doctor at one of the clinics for the infected, she is forced to witness endless suffering. What’s worse, strange things are happening to the remains of the dead, and by the time she befriends Ben Archer, she’s beginning to wonder if a global pandemic is the least of her problems….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;THISTLE &amp; THORNE BY ANN AGUIRRE &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After a catastrophic spill turns the country into a vast chemical wasteland, those who could afford it retreated to fortresses, self-contained communities run by powerful corporations. But for Mari Thistle, life on the outside—in the Red Zone—is a constant struggle. To protect her family, Mari teams up with the mysterious Thorne Goodman. Together, they’ll face an evil plot in both the underworld of the Red Zone and the society inside the fortresses that could destroy those on the outside…for good.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;SUN STORM BY KAREN DUVALL &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sarah Daggot has been chasing storms since she was a child. But after the biggest solar flares in history nearly destroy the planet, she becomes a Kinetic, endowed by her exposure to extreme radiation with the power to sense coming storms—in the cosmos and beyond. And she’s not the only one. Sarah believes the Kinetics are destined to join forces and halt the final onslaught of the sun. She’ll vow to keep trying to convince the one missing link in their chain of defence, the enigmatic Ian Matthews, up until the world ends.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;FEATURING A PREQUEL TO THE IMMORTAL RULES BY JULIE KAGAWA&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘Katniss Everdeen better watch out.’&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;– &lt;em&gt;Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt; on&lt;em&gt;T he Immortal Rules&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&#39;Julie Kagawa is one killer storyteller.’—MTV&lt;/p&gt;
