      <meta name="description" content="An after-school job in the extraordinary collection of a peculiar Antiquarian takes a startling turn for Carlos and Sage. In a terrifying moment, they become part of the history surrounding them. It is 1692 and the stakes are high, very high, as a conquering army&#39;s march threatens to bring genocide to an ancient people and their culture. Can Carlos, riding as the Captain General&#39;s aide, and Sage, the granddaughter of a Tewa Indian leader, forestall a massacre and bring about peace and religious tolerance? MATTHEW BACA was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where his family has ranched and farmed since the first days of European colonization, and continues to do so to this day. When not living the country life, he can be found conducting research at the University of New Mexico. Matthew&#39;s writing was first recognized by the Recursos de Santa Fe Discovery Competition for his award winning short story &quot;A Taste from the Past.&quot; This is his first novel." />
