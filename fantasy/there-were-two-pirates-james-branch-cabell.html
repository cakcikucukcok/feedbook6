  <title>There Were Two Pirates - James Branch Cabell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="His name was José Gasparilla, and he was the 
self-proclaimed King of Pirates. He terrorized 
the waters around Florida, demanding tribute 
from every merchant ship he encountered.
 Riches flowed into his tiny island kingdom...and yet he longed for a life he could never have, 
for he had left his beloved Isabel behind in Spain. 
One day he would return to claim her for his 
bride, for she had vowed to wait for him.
&lt;P&gt;
When he captures a ship and discovers Isabel 
and her elderly husband aboard, he strikes a 
deal with the man who stole his bride. A chance 
to regain the lost years of his life...to live his 
childhood again and pick a new path, in the 
Land Without Shadow...
&lt;P&gt;
There Were Two Pirates is a fantasy adventure in 
James Branch Cabell’s best style, and a terrific 
addition to the Wildside Fantasy Classics line." />
