      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Without a job, a family, or a life, Rebecca starts her day with the unfortunate realization that it is just another average day. Desperate to shed the shadow that constantly plagues her every waking moment, Rebecca heads to the beachher sanctuarywhere she is flooded with memories. As the surf pummels the beach, a gigantic wave suddenly rips a baby out of his mothers arms. Rebecca springs into action, saving the baby from drowning. As she awakens, Rebecca Stewart realizes once again that this is not her reality, but just another dreamor is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For as long as she can remember, Rebecca has had continual dreams of herself living within another world, where she seemingly lives a surreal life without her husband and two children. As she struggles to understand the meaning behind her dreams, Rebecca begins to piece together a complex puzzle that leads her to a shocking discovery: the government has been keeping tabs on her for a long time. Now all she has to do is figure out why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this compelling thriller in which dreams and reality intertwine, a woman is led down a perilous path where she must rely on inner strength, perseverance, and courage to break free from those who control her and return to the one world where she truly belongs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
