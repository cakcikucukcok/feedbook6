  <title>Man of Destiny - F. V. Hank Helmick.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kerry Sean ODonnell, a thrill seeker, is sailing tranquilly above the Austrian Alps in his soar plane when he is suddenly sucked into a vortex that sails him out over the Planet Therium where an enormous dragon knocks him spinning from the sky. He crash lands and within the hour he is fighting for his life defending a beautiful woman that has been attacked by a grotesque water creature. Sean is badly wounded and the womans friends operate on him genetically; and save and transform his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is propelled from one strange race of people to another and from one fight to another, as he fights and hacks his way looking for the women he has seen and fallen in love with. His opponents range from the crudest to the most sophisticated, and there appears to be no end of them, but his finesse in making friends saves him again and again from extermination. The story is one of action bestirred by more action and Sean and his friends take on all comers, but not without consequences. The fast paced story is truly a Sci-Fi fantasy for action lovers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
