  <title>The Spirit of Vengeance - Christopher Mac Lairn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="So, this is my first venture into science fiction, at least for writing it. I&#39;ve been a huge sci-fi fan all my life: I&#39;ve seen every Star Trek episode ever made, many of my all-time favorite movies are sci-fi  Alien, Predator, A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, et. al..
     However, I never thought I&#39;d write write it. I&#39;ve always written fantasy, and fantasy is all I&#39;ve ever written  until now. I have finally entered the arena of sci-fi as a writer, although there are those who think this is more fantasy in space than true sci-fi.
     Not that that&#39;s a terrible thing...
     So, in any event, Garm ap Avanon is the third and final (?) mortal incarnation of the Spirit of Vengeance. His first was in ancient Rome. In the second, he was a rogue adventurer who lived in the 19th century and traveled all over Asia, Africa and Europe. And now, in his 29th century incarnation he is a rogue adventurer yet again, a world-class martial artists with few if any equals. But, impressive as that obviously is, it&#39;s going to take a lot more than that. For he must face not only the unforgiving realities of Vulturnus  a savage, primal world that could be a near duplicate of Earth in the Mesozoic Era, dinosaurs and all  on the one hand but also, on the other, the forces of a powerful, merciless monarch hell-bent on carving out in the cosmos an empire like that his ancestors, the Conquistadors, carved out on Earth centuries before." />
