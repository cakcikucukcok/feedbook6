  <title>Stop Mass Hysteria: America&#39;s Insanity from the Salem Witch Trials to the Trump Witch Hunt by Michael Savage  | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Stop Mass Hysteria: America&amp;#39;s Insanity from the Salem Witch Trials to the Trump Witch Hunt by&amp;nbsp;Michael Savage&amp;nbsp; | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Left is deranged in its political reactions. Mass hysteria has happened in the past, as in the case of Cristopher Columbus and in the Communist scare that prevailed in the 1940s. The public insanity that resulted from these incidents were often created by politicians who had sinister motives. Author Michael Savage points out the effects on society which these events created.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
He cites the witch trials in Salem and compares these to panic reactions over Russian interference, climate change, President Trump, guns, among others. He says creating mass hysteria is a method used by the Left to incite restlessness among Americans. He warns that mistakes of the past will be replayed if people do not understand their history.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop Mass Hysteria is a New York Times bestseller.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Conversation Starters&lt;/i&gt; is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
