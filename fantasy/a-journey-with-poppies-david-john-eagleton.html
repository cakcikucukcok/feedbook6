mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&#39;&gt;While, together on several camping trips,
grandfather and grandson, John Moore and David John Eagleton, respectively,
wondered what life would be like when David John is as old as his
grandfather...in the year 2053.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Around
many campfires, they speculated about that future world, how it will change,
and how David Johns life would evolve.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&#39;&gt;What began as whimsical speculations became more
believable and from those, a story was born.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;It is the story of life in the mid-twenty first century, as it might
exist for David John, who will then be in his sixties, and his teenage
grandson, David John III.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;It is a story
of a grandfather and grandson.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;But it
is more than that.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;It is a commentary
on what might come to pass in areas such as technology, politics, warfare, and
human relations.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt&#39;&gt;If you have ever tried to imagine the future, you
know its relatively easy to dream but its downright hard to be a credible
visionary.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;However, the authors have
woven a mosaic of adventure, romance, and challenge into a believable
story.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;This book will challenge your
imagination and your ability to project yourself into time, fifty years in the
future.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Read it.&lt;span
