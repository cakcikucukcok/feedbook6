  <title>Survival of the Fittest - Michael Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The world is in turmoil. Reeling after a devastating alien invasion that decimates the worlds population, humanity survives in small communities, fighting for their lives. Countless millions died during the initial invasion, and those still alive are seen as nothing more than a food source for the hungry Quar. Governments quickly fall across the globe, and a primitive, brutal, survival mentality now consumes the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But amid the chaos, one small pocket of technology held out longer than the rest. Within a secret lab, Earths salvation rested on the small shoulders of a group of genetically modified children known only as the Theta DNA kids. No longer fully human, they carry the genetic traits of humanity withinand they now face the very destiny they had been engineered for. They were humanitys last, best hope for a futureany future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once out of the lab, the Theta DNA kids be-gin a dangerous, nomadic adventure. Along the way, they encounter other small groups of other Thetan DNA mutants and struggle to form alliances. Can these young heroes put their own adolescent insecurities aside long enough to truly work together for the common good? To do so, they must learn to work together, to leadand to fight for the very future of humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their enemies are close, but even the teens dont fully understand how close. Through the horrors of invasion, grief, loss, and brutal truth, these young soldiers fight for every-thing, with everything theyve been genetically enhanced to give.&lt;/p&gt;" />
