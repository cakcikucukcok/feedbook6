as his garden. &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Sabbah&lt;/span&gt; was an entrepreneur of sorts
using the assassin as a tool to gain political influence throughout the Middle
East. He would use young men by making them smoke hash then allowing them to
enter his garden of earthly delights. The young men were told they had entered
paradise and would be expelled if they did not carry out &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Sabbahs&lt;/span&gt;
wishes, which were usually to kill someone of relative importance. This tale is
not only a fictional look at &lt;span class=SpellE&gt;Sabbah&lt;/span&gt;, but also a
mind-altering look into Americas drug culture and the idea of paradise. &lt;span
