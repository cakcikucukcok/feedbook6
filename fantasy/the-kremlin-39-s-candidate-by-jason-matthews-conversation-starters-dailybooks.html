There is a plot to assassinate the CIA director and Russian double agent Dominika Egorova is in danger of being exposed. Her CIA handler Nate Nash with whom she has become romantically entangled goes on a mission to prevent her cover from being revealed. But Russian president Vladimir Putin has plans for Egorova and if this will push through, Egorova will either have more power in the Kremlin or die by execution.&lt;br /&gt;
The Kremlin&amp;rsquo;s Candidate is the third book in Jason Matthews&amp;rsquo; New York Times bestselling trilogy. The first book, Red Sparrow, has been turned into a film with Jennifer Lawrence as the seductively fatal undercover agent.&lt;br /&gt;
