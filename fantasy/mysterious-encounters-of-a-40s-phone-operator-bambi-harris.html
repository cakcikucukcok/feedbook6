  <title>Mysterious Encounters of a 40S Phone Operator - Bambi Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The year is 1944, and Violet Verne is approaching her 44th birthday with little enthusiasm.&lt;br /&gt;Her days are spent toiling as a telephone operator in the small town of Homestead Hills. Her nights are spent listening to Bing Crosby while staring up to the heavens with only her canine companion, Wells, at her side.&lt;br /&gt;But the night before her birthday, everything changes...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While wishing upon a falling star, Violet notices mysterious lights in the sky. Soon, mystery men are lurking in the streets, eerie calls are ringing in the night, and an enigmatic stranger, Griffin, appears with an aura of secrets, bringing more than this small town girl could bargain for.&lt;br /&gt;Opening her guarded heart to a whirlwind adventure, Violet joins the charismatic Griffin on a secretive mission and slowly piece together his knowledge of all this strange phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What danger has come to this sleepy town? What connection do these mystery men have to the coded messages coming through the phone lines, and the shimmering pastel lights in the sky? Can she trust her feelings for the handsome stranger?&lt;br /&gt;With romance and intrigue, &lt;em&gt;Mysterious Encounters of a 40s Phone Operator&lt;/em&gt; is guaranteed to delight and thrill, and maybe just make you wonder...&lt;/p&gt;" />
