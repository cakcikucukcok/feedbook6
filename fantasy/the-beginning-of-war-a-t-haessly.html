  <title>The Beginning of War - A. T. Haessly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;William Kries shares his tale of a lost love and the supernatural in this introductory tale. Will begins his journey with memory loss, but after a night&#39;s sleep he reclaims the events of the previous night. A deal struck with a shadowy angel gives him the opportunity of revenge for his dead wife; a deal Will gladly accepts. Will strikes out on a rampage of vengeance and suffering. &lt;br /&gt;The body count rises as Will begins his transformation into the biblical entity of the Apocalypse - War. The rider of the red horse, War rides to end the corruption of his world through violent madness. Combined with his hellish steed, his legendary sword, and his divine eyes of emerald he continues on his path of slaughter. &lt;br /&gt;William Kries made a deal with a shadowy angel, but listen as he shares his tale. Will his path lead him to shimmering gates and the open arms of his beloved? Or will they deliver him to the gates of damnation? Listen to his story as he becomes the second Horsemen of the Apocalypse. &lt;br /&gt;Let War ride.&lt;/div&gt;" />
