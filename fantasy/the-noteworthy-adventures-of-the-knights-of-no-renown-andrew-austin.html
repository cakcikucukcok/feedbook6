  <title>The Noteworthy Adventures of the Knights of No Renown - Andrew Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an epic poem about seven outcastes who go in search of a better life; there is Alpanore, whose charisma and gleeful recklessness mask his fear of being alone; William, an old alcoholic who knows better than his friends the high price of making a mistake; Ethan, a temperamental loudmouth with street smarts and a hidden heart of gold; Gunther, a big, brave soldier who has a speech impediment and a yearning to learn to read; Dodger, a timid rodent who longs to cook; Deep Johnny, an unstable genius who must live with a malformed face. And finally, there is Robert, a youth who is bitter that he grew up bullied and isolated. It is Robert who will have to find the courage to stand and fight when his friends need him the most.
As the seven meet and decide to travel together to find a home of their own, a home away from all the persecution and loneliness they have left behind, they face a host of dangers. Their world is filled with predators and hazards, including killer midgets, talking plants, hard-partying cannibals, a chainsaw wielding doctor, and more. And as they stumble through one disaster after another, they are watched with cold amusement by Disturbo the Clown, a marionette whose only desire is to make the world a worse place by encouraging others to act on their basest desires.
And awaiting the seven is the Cult of Weirdoes, a gang of serial killers who worship Disturbo and long for blood.
The story is filled with peculiar countries, creepy villains, and action. And it explores through the lives of the seven stumbling heroes the ideals of friendship, community, compassion, honor, and courage. It is a mixed-genre epic with elements of absurdist comedy, camp adventure, science fiction, horror, satire, and, eventually, serious drama." />
