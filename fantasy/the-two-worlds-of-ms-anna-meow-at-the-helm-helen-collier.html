  <title>The Two Worlds of Ms. Anna - Meow at the Helm, Helen Collier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Guided by supernatural forces, Anna Bradley leaves her lover, Raymond Forlorn, behind and returns to her hometown to reunite with her children and fulfill a personal mission. Now virtually a stranger to the family and friends she left behind four years earlier with only the remains of a burning car and no idea of her whereabouts, there is no question that Anna is a changed woman.
Anna has plans to finally divorce her adulterous husband, Jake, and leave with her children to create a new life. But a wrench is thrown in her plans when she discovers her husband will do anything to get her back, including killing Raymond and her attorney. When a near tragedy prompts an encounter with an old enemy, the supernatural forces lead her to move to Louisiana where a devastating discovery nearly ends her life. Deeply angered, Anna is left to question her relationship with the Supernatural forces until a deep dark secret is revealed that changes everything
In this continuing saga, a woman trapped between the supernatural and her harsh reality must confront life and death struggles in order to keep the two worlds apart and somehow find the happiness she knows she deserves.
Helen Collier has created a metaphor for the many challenges that people face as individuals and in relationships with friends, families and communities
