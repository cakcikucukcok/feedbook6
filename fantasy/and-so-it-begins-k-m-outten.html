  <title>And so It Begins... - K.M. Outten</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;And So It Begins... is a fantasy novel written for a large audience of people in the world who have longed for something more or different. It is a novel about traveling to another reality and living your dreams. But, it is also about people, their relationships to each other, and their understanding of themselves and their own reality. This novel provides people with something we all need; the opportunity to examine ourselves from the safe distance of a reader in another world.
&lt;P&gt;The story begins with Roxanne Black, a college student in 20th century America who hates the reality in which she lives, trying desperately to get through college and life without losing her mind. Then, one day, something extraordinary happens; she is given a mysterious pendant by a twisted and equally mysterious old man who immediately vanishes. The next thing she knows, Roxie cant take the necklace off, she starts having nightmares about people calling to her, and, for some reason, she can read the thoughts of some of those around her. An attempt to find out information about the pendant leads her down the road of no hope. Soon she realizes that she may be stuck with the thing forever. A thought which is somewhat terrifying, yet appealing to her overactive imagination.
&lt;P&gt;However, just as she resolves herself to a life of enslavement, Roxanne is faced with a new twist. She is magically transported to another reality. Now, here is where the story gets immensely entertaining. Roxanne fins herself in a world filled with Lords, trolls, demons, and warriors, where she is informed that she is one of three Chosen who must save the world in its battle with the Betrayer, (a really scary demon-type who is wiping out civilization as they know it). Deciding to accept everything as reality and not just a mass hallucination brought on by sleep deprivation and reading one too many fantasy novels herself, Roxie accepts her role and begins her journey.
&lt;P&gt;However, her books never told her that alternate realities are still realities. Instead of having super powers, skills, and knowledge, Roxie is still herself. She must learn to fight and she must learn to understand the world she is in, and she has to do it all in time to save the world- no small task. She also has to interact with real people who have real problems themselves. Suddenly, she finds herself in the middle of reality, only with a new cast of characters.
&lt;P&gt;There are the 13 Lords sworn to protect the Land. Of those, Lord Earin is young, scared, proud, and falls deeply in love with Roxanne. His constant feelings of inadequacy provide a never ending challenge for Roxanne and the other Lords. High Lord Brennen is very old, strong, and tired. He has been through this battle before and carries the scars of the ages. He assumes a great deal of guilt for all that happens to those around him as he directs them closer and closer to war. Lord Anjalina is a fiery, proud Lord who will stop at nothing to save the world she loves. Everything is black and white to her. There are no inbetweens. Lord Ambrose, who only wants people to be happy. He provides emotional strength and guidance for all the others. Often, he is the only thing keeping everyone from insanity.
&lt;P&gt;Aside from the Lords, Roxanne comes face to face with warriors of all kinds. The tall,
powerful General of the forces of good, General Sabastian, is in command of everything around him. He is sure of himself and confident in what has to be done. His orders and ideas leave no room for questions. He is a battle-worn, tactical genius. Yet, he too has been through this all before and shares the guilt of the High Lord. Another member of the fighting force is Major Elway who is notorious for getting out of impossible situations and getting into beds with the ladies. He is the &quot;Joe Cool&quot; of this reality, with plenty of reason to have a high opinion of himself.
