      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The dramatic conclusion to &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Vicki Pettersson&amp;#8217;s critically acclaimed Celestial Blues series&amp;#8212;an inventive blend of paranormal romance, noir mystery, and urban fantasy&amp;#8212;involving a fallen angel and a flesh-and-blood rockabilly reporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After learning his wife survived the attack that killed him fifty years earlier, angel/PI Griffin Shaw is determined to find Evelyn Shaw, no matter the cost. Yet his obsession comes at a price. Grif has had to give up his burgeoning love for reporter Katherine &amp;#8220;Kit&amp;#8221; Craig, the woman who made life worth living again, and dedicate himself to finding one he no longer knows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet when Grif is attacked again, it becomes clear that there are forces in both the mortal and heavenly realm who&amp;#8217;d rather see him dead than unearth the well-buried secrets of his past. If he&amp;#8217;s to survive his second go-round on the Surface, Grif will have to convince Kit to reunite with him professionally, and help uncover decades of police corruption, risking both their lives . . . and testing the limits to what one angel is really willing to give for love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
