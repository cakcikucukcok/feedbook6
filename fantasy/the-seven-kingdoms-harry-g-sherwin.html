      <meta name="description" content="A new Emperor sits on the throne of Justava, one who many now suspect has lead the Necromancers from the very beginning. The Masked Man is cunning and ruthless, and it will take more than a single victory for the Resistance to overthrow his tyrannical rule. 
	In an attempt to expand his army, Brenik divides his forces, sending Nalia and Yukov to the desert lands of Al Quidin whilst he and Ornith venture into the very heart of Resgard in search of a weapon that could change the fortunes of the war.
	In the midst of all the fighting arrives Torrin Welfast, an explorer from a distant country. Venturing into a land at war, Torrin comes across an old man who claims to be hiding a power that dates back to the very founding of Justava and that endangers the country far more than the civil war that rages over the land. Tasked with destroying this artefact, Torrin embarks on a quest that sees him battling the Emperor and his dark past, confronting his innermost fears and desires, and that will ultimately decide the fate of Justava and the world around her." />
