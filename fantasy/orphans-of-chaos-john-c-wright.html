  <title>Orphans of Chaos - John C. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;John C. Wright burst onto the SF scene with the Golden Age trilogy. His next project was the ambitious fantasy sequence, &lt;i&gt;The Last Guardians of Everness.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wright&#39;s new fantasy is a tale about five orphans raised in a strict British boarding school who begin to discover that they may not be human beings. The students at the school do not age, while the world around them does. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The children begin to make sinister discoveries about themselves. Amelia is apparently a fourth-dimensional being; Victor is a synthetic man who can control the molecular arrangement of matter around him; Vanity can find secret passageways through solid walls where none had previously been; Colin is a psychic; Quentin is a warlock. Each power comes from a different paradigm or view of the inexplicable universe: and they should not be able to co-exist under the same laws of nature. Why is it that they can?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The orphans have been kidnapped from their true parents, robbed of their powers, and raised in ignorance by super-beings no more human than they are: pagan gods or fairy-queens, Cyclopes, sea-monsters, witches, or things even stranger than this. The children must experiment with, and learn to control, their strange abilities in order to escape their captors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
