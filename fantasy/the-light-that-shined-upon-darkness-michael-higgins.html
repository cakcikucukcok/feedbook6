  <title>The Light That Shined Upon Darkness - Michael Higgins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dave and Jay, best friends from Cleveland, Ohio, both grew up with one goal in mindgetting paid! Both being natural-born hustlers, money came easy to them. Managing the lifestyle that came along with it was the hard part. 
Dave, a husband and owner operator of the Reason, an inner-city nightclub adorned with exotic dancers, did his best to balance both lifestyles. He believed that he was doing a good job too. His wife, Tracie, who wasn&#39;t exactly a saint herself, seemed to think otherwise. Eventually, Tracie&#39;s trust issues led her into the arms of another guy. Dave, feeling the distance between the two of them, reluctantly hired a bombshell named Shanina, who eventually swept him off his feet. 
Jay, a hustler turned general contractor, who believed in loyalty, had other problems. But with an extremely loyal girlfriend in Candace, who believed in him unequivocally, what real issues could Jay possibly have? The lifestyle! Jay wanted out. The further he tried to remove himself, though, the closer it came. 
With two best friends going in polar-opposite directions, see what unfortunate event reunites their lifestyles for a final time!" />
