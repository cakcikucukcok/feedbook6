  <title>Zawadi - Esther N. Mwangi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Zawadi was right: a puny woman who was still a political armature, operating from the equally punitive Zanzibar would not have interested a mighty giant like America. There was a deeper reason for their interest in Africa in general, that went far before Zawadi&#39;s time.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a futuristic world, an extraordinary woman named Zawadi becomes the first president of a united Africa. She lives in an undated &quot;anything goes&quot; era during which the world is inundated by transgenic madness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Zawadi discovers that America, in cahoots with Argentinean Mafiosi, hired her best friend to try and stop Zawadi from becoming president. But their reasons are economical: vast oil deposits, caused by a shift of the earth&#39;s crust, have collected underneath Africa. Coveting this oil wealth, America wants to hasten the formation of a world government. Can Zawadi successfully lead her country through this global challenge?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Replete with futuristic technologies, including laser operated pest control, and air crafts that have a capacity to stop in midair, &lt;I&gt;Zawadi&lt;/I&gt; takes an intriguing look at a future plagued by our own twenty-first-century problems." />
