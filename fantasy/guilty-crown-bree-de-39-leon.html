      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;To Morena Darkstorm, fighting for the equality of her citizens in her kingdom, Arisite, is a dangerous game in the vampyre court. The high nobles seek to enslave their lower silver counterparts to enhance their rule and to sign an alliance with their enemy kingdom of 100 years Kindred. She finds herself at odds with her family, speaking against the injustice of their lands with only the support of her closest servants, Lucille an ancient silver of great power and Amelia, a silver-haired maid with more power than she knows. When Alexander Lothbrok, a soulkeeper and the ruling King of the people, enters Arisite capital, Casai, he is beguiled by Morenas affection towards her people. Unknowingly, he finds himself at odds with an unlikely threat Amelia. With the girls&amp;#39; powers unlocking, Morena and Amelia become one in the same to protect the realms.&lt;/p&gt;" />
