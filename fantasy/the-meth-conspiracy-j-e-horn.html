  <title>The Meth Conspiracy - J.E. Horn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jonathan Champion was the golden boy. A federal prosecutor who made his mark bringing down some of the biggest meth dealers the country had ever known, and he did it in glamorous style. But fame often has a price, and Champion paid for it with the life of his wife and child.
Now, he is a broken man. Scarred, both inside and out, he wants to hide from the world. But its not this world that needs him.
Champion finds himself taken to a world filled with magicand meth. A place where human beings, or mundanes , are used like chattel. Here mundanes are forced into meth addiction that destroys them, body and soul. All in order to provide energy for their powerful masters.
A crazed old woman tells him that he is the only hope for his people. That he is a mage with almost unreal powers. So Champion must choose. To embrace this new world and pit his fledgling powers against impossible odds or to hide and fade away.
As Champion deals with his inner struggles and tries to stay alive, he and his companions begin to unravel a conspiracy that stinks of human misery and ancient evil. A conspiracy that traces the meth epidemic to this new world." />
