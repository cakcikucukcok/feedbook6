  <title>Dark Beginnings - Kris Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Experience where it all began for Gabriel Redfeather and his quest to save the world from demons in &lt;i&gt;Dark Beginnings!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Dark Storm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Gabriel is a New York City college kid who loves to bury his nose in books, looking up stories of long-dead cultures, lost languages, and forgotten legends. He never imagined one of those legends would come looking for &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;--until a tough-talking girl named De Mona Sanchez thrusts an ancient weapon into his hands...and recruits Gabriel in a dark epic war he was born to fight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banished centuries ago by warrior knights, a demonic army is storming through a dimensional rift into our world. Stalkers are prowling the streets. Corpses are rising up to fight. And Gabriel--a descendant of one of the original warriors--has no choice but to drop his textbooks and start kicking demon butt alongside his new friend De Mona...who has a few secrets of her own. If Gabriel fails, humanity loses. If war is hell,&lt;i&gt; this is hell on earth...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Demon Hunt&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Soul-sucking demons. Half-human killers. Doomsday prophesies. No, this isn&#39;t a late-night movie on cable TV. This is Gabriel&#39;s life--or least, what&#39;s left of it--ever since he discovered his true destiny as a warrior knight in the battle against darkness.  Once an ordinary college kid studying lost legends in books, Gabriel now finds himself face to face with actual demons. As a warrior, he has no choice but to fight them. And if he screws it up, the world is toast...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dimensional rift has opened between worlds. Which means more demons--and more death--than you could shake a proverbial stick at. Luckily, Gabriel has just the stick for the job, an ancient trident that gives him awesome demon-bashing powers. To watch his back he has the butt kicking half Demon De Mona and several unlikely heroes who he&#39;s picked up along the way. To make matters more complicated two of Gabriel&#39;s college buddies wind up dead and he finds that the demons aren&#39;t the only ones who want a piece of his hide. The cops want him too--for murder...&lt;/p&gt;" />
