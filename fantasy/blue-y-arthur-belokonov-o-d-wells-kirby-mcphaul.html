  <title>Blue-Y - Arthur Belokonov, O. D. Wells, Kirby McPhaul</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Picking up where they left off in RED-X, BLUE-Y finds the alien girl Zodoo chaotically pursuing her birthright to become a GOD after being possessed by the demon Kali. After much doing they subdue her but by then the earth is invaded by the Insectoids, forcing Obediah to revive Zodoo/Kali to raise her undead army to help thwart sure defeat. As one worldwide battle ensued, politicians initiated multiple schemes to undermine and control the worlds poor and sabotage Terrordyne&#39;s aid projects across the globe. Fighting off invading aliens, corrupt politicians controlled by the 1 per-centers, the worldwide nuclear threat, and abject poverty forced upon the people, Terrordyne&#39;s leader employs a master plan of his own to rid the world of these evils once and for all. By instituting massive work projects, jobs programs, and incredible humanitarian inventions, Obediah begins to free the poor and middle class from under the boots of the oppressive regimes that kept the masses locked out. Their schemes and plots culminated in the firing of every nuke on the planet straight at Ten Mile High. See Monolithica, the Obama Maru, the Tokugawa, the Huangdi, and Alexander weapons platforms combine to fight off Yacafearian invaders, as the Giant Behemoth, commanded by Jeraldo Icefinger fights to capture the Insectoid Queen, Mettarra.  With megalomaniacal Gods, multiple alien attackers, demons from other dimensions and good old fashion solutions to corruption, this is the answer to a lot of questions unleashed in this non-descript package. Wow Hold onto you hats, cause this is some kind of ride!&lt;br&gt;" />
