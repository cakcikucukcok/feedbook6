  <title>Giuseppe’S Dresser - Vernon Farris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One night, while visiting San Francisco, I had a intriguing encounter with a distressed and well traveled dresser. This chance meeting sparked the gray matter deep inside my skull. I became obsessed with writing and illustrating a childrens book about a dresser!
It was my opportunity to express my art and explore the world of words. Being a giant six foot, 250 pound child myself, it seemed quite natural to write a book for kids. . So after many, many, re-writes, I am proud to present Giuseppes Dresser.
Take a nostalgic journey and visit the town of Falling Leaf Falls. In the year 1939, this quaint little town, deep in the heart of Maine, had 932 inhabitants. Acts of kindness and good deeds were the order for every day. Children used their imagination to play. Hand held electronic devices didnt exist. The good town folk worked very hard and when a holiday rolled around they rewarded themselves with a joyous celebration.
Our hero, Giuseppe, was the town craftsman. He created many carousel animals for many a
circus. My story begins when a spoiled, little girl asked him to make her a beautiful dresser. In this case, our hero creates another hero with the secret of his magic. Perhaps the most incredible piece of furniture ever created. Give a read and see how this dresser changes the lives of every child it comes in contact with." />
