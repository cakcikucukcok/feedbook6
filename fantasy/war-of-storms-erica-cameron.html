  <title>War of Storms - Erica Cameron</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The immortal mages have risen, and they&#39;re out for blood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Khya arrived at the Ryogan coast too late to stop the invasion. Now, cities are falling before the unrelenting march of an enemy army, and Khya&#39;s squad is desperately trying to stay ahead of them. Warning the Ryogans, though, means leaving her brother imprisoned even longer. Time is running out for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But how can her squad of ten stand against an army of ten thousand?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Calling in help from every ally she&#39;s made in Ryogo, Khya tries to build a plan that won&#39;t require sacrificing her friends or her brother. It&#39;s a tough balance to find, especially when the leadership role she thought she wanted sits heavy on her shoulders, and her relationship with Tessen is beginning to crack under the strain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The end is coming, and there&#39;s no way to know who&#39;ll be left standing when it hits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ryogan Chronicles are best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Island of Exiles&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Sea of Strangers&lt;br&gt;Book #3 War of Storms&lt;/p&gt;" />
