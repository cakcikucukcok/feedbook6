  <title>The Nameless Day - Sara Douglass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Black Plague.  The Pestilence.  Disease and death haunt every town and village across 14th century Europe and none are immune from its evil.  Some see the devastation of their world as a sign from God for Man&#39;s wickedness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Brother Thomas Neville sees this swath of death as something much more.  Neville is a man beset by demons.  Or is it angels?  He has had a visitation from none other than the Archangel Michael, who commands Thomas to a mission.  This mission will take Neville across the length and breath of the continent in a desperate bid to find the means to stop the minions of Satan who have found a doorway out of Hell and are preparing to venture forth, to try and seize this world in preparation for an assault on Heaven itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Thomas Neville encounters angels and demons, saints and witches, he comes to realize that the armies of God and Satan are arraying themselves for the final battle...and that his soul is to be the battleground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question is, has Neville picked the truly good side?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
