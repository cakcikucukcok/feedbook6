  <title>From Brain to Toe and Beyond - George Same</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This book is a collection of three scripts.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The first is the Brain Game. This concerns the efforts of a short-sighted, freelance, charlatan surgeon, to bring his method of brain transplantation to the Worlds&#39; attention. The trouble is nobody takes him seriously. Therefore he has to work surreptiously and take funds from dodgy financial wheeler-dealers.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Then there is the story of a depressed, unemployed actor. This man is desperate to go out with his attractive flatmate. In his desire to impress her, heperforms a ventriloquist act with his big toe. She loves it. Unfortunately her love only extends to his toe and not beyond. She persuades him to go on stage with his act, which is a great success. In the meantime shemakes plans, along with others,to run off with the actor&#39;s toe, and break up the showbiz partnership of miserable,sulky personand bodily part.But events do not quite pan out as expected.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Finally, there is the story of three upwardly mobile friends. They believe they have finally acheived their goal of middle class, respectablilty when they are invited to a wine and cheese party in Hampstead. Unfortunately the household turns out to be a den of vampires.Two escape, butthe sporty oneis kidnapped. They go to enlist the help of a fearless vampire hunter. But end up with a drunken old reprobate to guide them. They eventually kill the vampires and retrieve their friend, by luck rather than judgement. Along the way they learn some shocking truths about Nineteenth Century Liberals, the class sytem, history, and why gardeners tend to be werewolves.&lt;/P&gt;" />
