  <title>Brotherhood of the Wolf - David Farland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Volume Two of &lt;i&gt;The Runelords&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raj Ahtan, ruler of Indhopal, has used enough forcibles to transform himself into the ultimate warrior: The Sum of All Men. Ahtan seeks to bring all of humanity under his rule-destroying anything and anyone that stood in his path, including many friends and allies of young Prince Gaborn Val Orden. But Gaborn has fulfilled a two-thousand-year-old prophecy, becoming the Earth King-a mythic figure who can unleash the forces of the Earth itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now the struggle continues. Gaborn has managed to drive off Raj Ahtan, but Ahtan is far from defeated. Striking at far-flung cities and fortresses and killing dedicates, Ahtan seeks to draw out the Earth King from his seat of power, to crush him. But as they weaken each other&#39;s forces in battle, the armies of an ancient and implacable inhuman enemy issue forth from the very bowels of the Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
