  <title>Rainbow&#39;s Shadow and the Covenant of Wisdom - John Cicero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rainbows Shadow and the Covenant of Wisdom picks up where Rainbows Shadow and the Tablets of Fate leaves off.  Will, Jimmy and Bryan are back to their normal lives until Will is rushed to the hospital with a bizarre case of vertigo.  With his head spinning like a top and dreams of his grandfather back in full force, Will is convinced he is being called back to Rainbow Alley for something big.
He has secretly tried to gain access back into the portal for months, and his failed attempts to open the vortex have frustrated him beyond belief.  Convinced the portal is permanently closed, Will sits in his hospital room confused.
It was temptation which lured Bryan to take the shiny black stone as a souvenir from Rainbow Alley.  Little did he know he had provided a way for evil to rejuvenate.
As he admires the shiny black stone he finishes reading yet another Sorcerers Shadow novel entitled The Pirates Revenge.  With the book resting up against the stone and another novel entitled The Island Where Magic Began, it only takes a few seconds for the evil forces of the Sorcerers Shadow to emanate from the stone and open the portal.
As the two novels meld together and the portal opens, Will finds himself confronted by an eccentric messenger who instructs him to return the stone.  Once the stone is returned the Covenant of Wisdom will be revealed and provide the necessary knowledge to open the path to true paradise.
Will and Jimmy find themselves on a new journey into a surreal world as they find access into the portal and into a new adventure.  Their mission at first is to save Bryan but quickly transforms into a quest for all mankind." />
