  <title>For Generations to Come - Richard Feldstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The second book in the Chardin Chronicles, For Generations to Come, continues the saga of three men who must confront the consequences of their past choices and learn how those choices will determine their futures, for better or worse.
After serving in the military of the Unified Territories in a war of attrition against the people of Torkos, the disillusioned Major Joe Horgon returns home ten years later to find his home irrevocably changed. There are new forces at work in the Unified Territories, forces that prove to be dangerous to Joe and his family. His neighborhood is in shambles, street gangs are the ones in charge, and Joes wife and son are missing. 
Determined to find them, Joe sets out to rescue his family. Along the way, he encounters a formidable enemy. A charismatic gang leader known as the Gent has conspired with High Priest Morthuza to give gang members a serum that creates a more powerful warrior. He rules the streets and intends to wipe out any who oppose him.
Joes search brings him face to face with the Gent, and in this epic battle of wills, there can only be one survivor." />
