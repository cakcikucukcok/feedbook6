But then the feathers started sprouting beneath her skin, invading her lungs like a strange cancer, and Hermes showed up with a fever eating away his flesh. Desperately seeking the cause of their slow, miserable deaths, Athena and Hermes travel the world, gathering allies and discovering enemies both new and old. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mortal Gods&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt; Ares, god of war, is leading the other dying gods into battle.

If not, at least she&#39;ll have killed the bloody lot of them, and she and Hermes can die in peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ungodly&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;For the Goddess of Wisdom, what Athena didn&#39;t know could fill a book. That&#39;s what Ares said. So she was wrong about some things. So the assault on Olympus left them beaten and scattered and possibly dead. So they have to fight the Fates themselves, who, it turns out, are the source of the gods&#39; illness. And sure, Athena is stuck in the underworld, holding the body of the only hero she has ever loved. But Hermes  is still topside, trying to power up Andie and Henry before he runs out of time and dies, or the Fates arrive to eat their faces&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Other Tor Teen books by Kendare Blake&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anna Dressed in Blood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Girl of Nightmares&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
