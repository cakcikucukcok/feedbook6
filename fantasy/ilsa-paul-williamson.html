  <title>Ilsa - Paul Williamson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ilsa is a passionate woman. Her life is a story of adventure, bravery, compassion, learning, leadership, triumph, and loss. She is a soul on a journey, learning many lessons as well as she can, living in an ancient Celtic world. The society where she lives is ruled by a spiritual government that espouses strong green values and respect for Mother Earth in all its forms; it is a place where people strive for peace and harmony in their lives. It is a very different world from the modern, high tech, and materialistic culture in which we inhabit today. However, even though this story is set in the more primitive past, there are many values in the lifestyle Ilsa and her friends live which could be applicable to our life today and could help us to move forward to a better future. All is not well in the land. There are threats of war and invasion, and Ilsa is confronted with personal struggles with some of those closest to her. Ilsa would wish to make everything right with everyone she meets, and she tries her utmost to do this. But sometimes, even the strongest and most determined souls meet limits to what they are able to do, and the lesson for her is about acceptance and letting go. However, Ilsa is not one to surrender, and her own fierce nature leads her on when, for others, all would seem lost. It is with this passion that she finally finds peace in this moving tale.&lt;/p&gt;" />
