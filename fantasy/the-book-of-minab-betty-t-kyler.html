  <title>The Book of Minab - Betty T. Kyler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After a strong-willed young woman ?nds herself the sole survivor of a plane crash, she is forced to become the newest resident of a lost ancient civilization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three weeks shy of her seventeenth birthday, Breena Keets embarks on a two-week expedition to the North Pole. As she, her father and several others board the tiny plane, no one has any idea that a storm lurks in the distance. On the ?nal leg of their journey to the land of the midnight sun, tragedy strikes and the plane crashes. Breena is the sole survivor. Worse yet, she has no idea where she is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Breena awakens, she soon learns she is in Moatsha, a strange land where there are, unfamiliar maps, strictly enforced laws, and no modern conveniences. Now Breena is not only lost, but deathly afraid she will never be found. Unwittingly catapulted into an ancient civilization where power, lust, violence, and love rule, Breena struggles to learn the ways of the people, and is forced into marrying a ?erce warrior. As the strange world envelops Breena, she ?ghts to survive within its suppressive society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caught between the only world she has ever known and a foreign land, Breena is about to discover that fate will not only determine her destiny, but also the future of those she loves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
