  <title>Where the Light Touches - Zachary J.M. Wilhelm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Steampunk fantasy meets coming-of-age adventure in this vibrant novel. Summer is ending in the Gulf Coastal town of Harbor Haven. Eccentric newcomers seem to appear out of nowhere. Although scrutinized by the locals at first, the strangers soon open their doors to reveal a new choclolate shop with a twist: everything is free. Smiles soon replace the scowls of the townspeople. Nonetheless, the shop&amp;#39;s owner, a mysteriously silent man in a bowler hat, remains ever aloof and watchful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the shadows of autumn stands Felix, a boy with a secret powerful enough to influence the fate of the world...if only he could remember who he is. With no memory of his own life, something powerful pushes Felix toward the shop&amp;#39;s strange owner. Somehow, he knows, the secrets of his identity are waiting behind the shop&amp;#39;s sweet displays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little does Felix realize that the fate of the world is at stake. Time is running down. Shadows are closing in. Nothing will be exactly as it appears in this tale of friendship, redemption, and heroism.&lt;/p&gt;" />
