  <title>The Island of Dreams - Gregory James Clark</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 2107, twenty-four year-old Gary Loman is disillusioned with life. There are scant opportunities in the capitalist world that surrounds him. When he receives a prestigious invitation, Gary knows that the change he has been waiting for has finally arrived; it&#39;s a ticket to fame and glory as a skater.&lt;br&gt;Leaving the old world behind, Gary embarks on a new adventure on The Island of Dreams, led by the world&#39;s newest monarchy, where he is introduced to the woman who will become his wife and a wildly different social order, one which has evolved over the previous seventy years by virtue of a slow, quiet and largely unnoticed revolution. By 2107, however, The Island is poised to become one of the most powerful states in the world, acquiring, most notably, the territory of Kamchatka.&lt;br&gt;The Island Queen, Queen Katie of Kamchatka, with the help of her devoted Prime Minister and her faithful staff, then attempt to educate and train the 240 receivers of the distinguished Queen&#39;s Ticket, both for their roles as skaters and within the Kamchatskiy organisation, for whom they will be working under a completely new concept in political economy, based on quality rather than profit motives, and which is replacing Marxism as the world&#39;s rival to capitalism.&lt;br&gt;As Gary progresses on The Island, and as its Queen seeks out her new King, the world is on the brink of a breath-taking transformation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
