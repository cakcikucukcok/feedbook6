  <title>Kala Bear Wars: A New Mythology - Neil Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Kala Bear Wars began as a story told in episodes on Facebook. The story grew, the characters came alive and started speaking for themselves. Friends joined in the adventure with comment and additional input. Some of those friends, in their aka identities, became characters themselves. The Kala Bear Wars is based on those initial Facebook posts, now expanded and presented in book form.&lt;br /&gt; It all started because of what humans were doing to the koala&amp;#39;s habitat. Koalas suffered but were powerless to do anything about it. That is until some curious bears stumbled across an illicit marijuana crop, hidden in Kondalilla National Park. The resinous heads of the marijuana plants were certainly tasty but unfortunately, the koala brain could not deal with the psychoactive cannabinoids they contained. The eyes of these bears turned from brown to blue and koala became kala.&lt;br /&gt; The kalas developed human intelligence, stupid and wicked humans that is. They got organised and&amp;nbsp;set about attacking what they saw, rightfully, as the source of all their problems - humans. They fought back against human encroachment,&amp;nbsp;beginning a war that now encompasses not only our familiar physical realm, but also the dreaming. What the kalas have unleashed is an enacting of what was already proceeding beyond the level of human consciousness; the Great Transition of &amp;nbsp;Planet Earth.&lt;br /&gt; This Great Transision was predicted by numerous ancient cultures and our&amp;nbsp;times will decide whether we enter the longed-for golden age, or fall into darkness. Demonic forces back the kala bears, promising apocalypse and eventually, kala dominion. However, they had not counted on Commander Lord Winnie the Only and his companion, Silverfox.&lt;br /&gt; Winnie and Silverfox represent Sirius Home, the main planet of the Sirius system. Sirius and Earth have an ancient connection, with Sirius in the role of mentor. Sirius,&amp;nbsp;under the guidance of the Bodhisattva Council of Canopus, is here to support Earth through the great transition. Commander Winnie has formed an allied force of Sirius agents, humans, and some normally unseen but very powerful spirit beings.&lt;br /&gt; Together they fight the Kala Bear Wars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
