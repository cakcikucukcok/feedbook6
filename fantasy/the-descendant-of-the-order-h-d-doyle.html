      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Years ago, the Order of Virtues waged war against Gods angels. It began when the archangel Michael was summoned to a disturbancea disturbance that soon turned into an ambush. The Order of Virtues, however, was defeated, despite their surprise attack. They were banished to Earth, where they now wander, infecting human souls with evil.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Atnis Trepe is a young man back in his old neighborhood, there to take care of some family business. Soon, strange things begin to happen. Atnis feels as though he is being watched. He has terrible dreamspossibly visions, though he cant be sure. Then, he discovers a mysterious winged dagger in his coat pocket. How did it get there, and who did it belong to?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Meanwhile, members of the Order of Virtues are in no way resigned to their lives on Earth. They want to challenge Heaven to another battle, but to do so, they must find the Sword of Glory, which they believe will enable their victory. Atnis has no idea that he is the only thing standing in their wayand that soon he will become a supernatural force to be reckoned with.&lt;/P&gt;" />
