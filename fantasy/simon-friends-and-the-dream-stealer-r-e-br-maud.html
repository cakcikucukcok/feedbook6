  <title>Simon, Friends, and the Dream Stealer - R. E. Brémaud</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is always summer in the secret town of Dreamville, a small village inhabited by artistic, scientific, and imaginative people dressed in colorful clothing. Simon Dreamlee is a musically dream inclined dreamer of  twelve-year-old who has always known his town to be a place where dreams come trueuntil the day he realizes the principal of Dreamtrue School is after him for no reason at all.
It is not long before Principal Toombsa man with yellow teeth, a pointy nose, and a mission to torment Simon and his friend, Almont Alldreamconfiscates Simons dreams. While he is banned to the principals office for a day of punishment, Simon observes the secretive secretary, Miss DreamNot, who, for some mysterious reason, is hoarding the computer chips that hold all the students dreams come true instead of recycling them as she should. Simon wonders who Miss DreamNot really is and why she and Principal Toombs are so miserable in such a lively town.
Simons troubles are just beginning, though; he will have to stand trial and have his latest dream scrutinized and possibly banned. Before that happens, however, he and Almont must uncover the secret that these two peculiar characters are hiding from everyone in Dreamville." />
