  <title>Fear to Lose - Jadyn Patrilita, Petimara Ualesi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Zekiah and Jaron thought that the drama was over once they got rid of Charity, Jarons adopted sister, and Jaden, but instead, everything fell apart again when Leila, Jarons dead ex-girlfriend, showed up at their front door with her son, Caleb.
Little did they know, Leila wasnt the only problem. Zekiahs past was brought back to life when her mothers secret lover escaped from prison. She knew that she had Jaron to rely on when Wes escaped, but at the same time, she thought that she was also too much for him. Wes wasnt the only one thats after Zekiah but also Jarons father, Niko, and Zekiahs ex-boyfriend, Ben.
What will happen to their engagement if theres no way out from all these people interfering with their love life?" />
