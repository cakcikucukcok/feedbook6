  <title>The Paradise War - Stephen Lawhead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;When I opened my eyes, I was no longer in the world I knew.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lewis Gillies is an American graduate student in Oxford who should be getting on with his life. Yet for some reason, he finds himself speeding north with his roommate Simon on a lark--half-heartedly searching for a long-extinct creature allegedly spotted in a misty glen in Scotland. Expecting little more than a weekend diversion, Lewis accidently crosses through a mystical gateway where two worlds meet: into the time-between-times, as the ancient Celts called it. And into the heart of a collision between good and evil that&#39;s been raging since long before Lewis was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First published almost twenty years ago, The Song of Albion Trilogy has become a modern classic that continues to attract passionate new readers. Enter into &lt;em&gt;The Paradise War &lt;/em&gt;and experience the dazzling brilliance of a world like ours--yet infinitely bolder and brighter: a place of kings and warriors, bards and battles, feats of glory and honour. It is a place you will forever wish to be. It is Albion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
