  <title>Curse of the Seven 70s - Sharon E Anderson, Keri Knutson, Nicole Persun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Curse of the Seven 70s
Sometimes love proves stronger than revenge, even for Vlad Dracula&#39;s younger brother...
Cassandra Blake is having a very bad day. Her fiancé dumps her for a silicone debutante and convinces her to store his boxes of precious research. If that wasn&#39;t bad enough, she&#39;s just moved into a cottage stocked only with sardines, canned peaches, and 50 year-old Scotch. 
Heartbroken, hungry, and a little bit drunk, Cassandra soon realizes that just when she thinks things can&#39;t get any worse, sometimes they can get very strange...like finding a skeleton in the basement of her newly inherited cottage. 
But when that skeleton suddenly becomes a hot, romantic, and business savvy vampire named Varo...well, things can get a little better. That is...until his infamous older brother shows up, and their centuries old sibling rivalry threatens her chance at true love. 
Can their love survive her conniving ex-fiancé, Varo&#39;s vengeful brother, and the Curse of the Seven 70s?" />
