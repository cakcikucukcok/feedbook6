He and his family were given the gift of having their ages frozen in time by the gods of the ancient druids. His ancient rival is the dreaded Tyrannous and his Gladiators, who made a pact with the devil that allowed them to fight in all the great wars in history for two millennium. However, during this two thousand year pact, Tyrannous did not bargain on the Gladigator being around to confront him at every turn. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

However, the emperor deceived the children of Rome by ordering his men to capture Gladigator. Gladigator knew he had to get out of the Roman empire and heads for Caledonia, Scotland. He knows that the Roman empire stops a Hadrians Wall and that he would be safe in Caledonia.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

Follow his many adventures along the way, culminating in the fantastic showdown with Tyrannous and his men in Auchinlea Park, where they reproduce the ancient Circus Maximus of Rome in the heart of Auchinlea Park, whilst the whole of the 21st century world holds its breath for the outcome of this final conflict between good and evil. &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

The book is also crammed full of Glasgows history, including the Bishoploch, Provan Hall house, and Blairtumock House, just to name a few.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
