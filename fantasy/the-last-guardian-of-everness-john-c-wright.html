  <title>The Last Guardian of Everness - John C. Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The  rave reviews for John Wright&#39;s science fiction trilogy, The Golden Age, hail his debut as the most important of the new century. Now, in &lt;i&gt;The Last Guardian of Everness&lt;/i&gt;, this exciting and innovative writer proves that his talents extend beyond SF, as he offers us a powerful novel of high fantasy set in the modern age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young Galen Waylock is the last watchman of the dream-gate beyond which ancient evils wait, hungry for the human world.  For a thousand years, Galen&#39;s family stood guard, scorned by a world which dismissed the danger as myth. Now, the minions of Darkness stir in the deep, and the long, long watch is over. Galen&#39;s patient loyalty seems vindicated.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That loyalty is misplaced. The so-called Power of Light is hostile to modern ideas of human dignity and liberty. No matter who wins the final war between darkness and light, mankind is doomed either to a benevolent dictatorship or a malevolent one. And so Galen makes a third choice: the sleeping Champions of Light are left to sleep. Galen and his companions take the forbidden fairy-weapons themselves. Treason, murder, and disaster follow. The mortals must face the rising Darkness alone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ambitious and beautifully written story, &lt;i&gt;The Last Guardian of Everness&lt;/i&gt; is an heroic adventure that establishes John Wright as a significant new fantasist. It is just the start of a story that will conclude in the companion volume, &lt;i&gt;Mists of Everness&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
