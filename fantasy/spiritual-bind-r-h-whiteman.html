  <title>Spiritual Bind - R.H. Whiteman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;For the past three hundred years, the medieval realm of Bijulan has been under a subversive attack from an evil wizard named Guerric. Now that the kingdom is ruled by young King Malcolm, Guerric increases his efforts to gain control of the realm, a move which could lead to a destructive war of wizards.&lt;P&gt; In modern El Paso, Justin Moran creates a teleporter which accidentally sends him to ancient Bijulan where he finds himself drawn into the power struggle between Guerric and King Malcolm and his own wizard Redmund. Justin agrees to help capture and transport Guerric to the Wizards&#39; Council if Redmund will help Justin return home afterward. &lt;P&gt;	They encounter obstacles and dangers the entire way, and Justin is shocked to discover that he himself may be the most powerful wizard in the alien land. Without fully understanding him magical powers, he discovers that Guerric is determined to destroy the land in order to confront the Creator Himself. Justin must either overcome his doubts about magic and save the land from Guerric or deny his powers and be at the mercy of the dark wizard.&lt;/P&gt;" />
