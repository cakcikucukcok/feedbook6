  <title>Stay with Me: A novel by Ayobami Adebayo | Conversation Starters - dailyBooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Stay with Me: A novel by Ayobami Adebayo | Conversation Starters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &amp;ldquo;Stay with Me&amp;rdquo;, readers are taken on a familiar journey with an original cast of characters and unique literary voice. The novel follows Yejide and Akin, a Nigerian couple who have been married since they met at university. Yejide&amp;rsquo;s difficulties with becoming pregnant eventually lead Akin to take a second wife, breaking the couple&amp;rsquo;s agreement to remain monogamous. As Yejide attempts to get pregnant, she must deal with the jealousy and fury she feels at her husband&amp;rsquo;s choice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ayobami Adebayo&amp;rsquo;s debut novel is unforgettable, bursting with color and heart and, as The Guardian describes, &amp;ldquo;demonstration of female spirit&amp;rdquo;. The beautiful and nuanced prose invites readers to explore the familiar motif of marital struggles through the lens of a culture that is patriarchal and oppressive. Heartbreak and the expectations of family and community weigh heavily in Adebayo&amp;rsquo;s narrative, creating a rich and layered story that earned both critical and commercial acclaim.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Brief Look Inside:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EVERY GOOD BOOK CONTAINS A WORLD FAR DEEPER&lt;br /&gt;
than the surface of its pages. The characters and their world come alive,&lt;br /&gt;
and the characters and its world still live on.&lt;br /&gt;
Conversation Starters is peppered with questions designed to&lt;br /&gt;
bring us beneath the surface of the page&lt;br /&gt;
and invite us into the world that lives on.&lt;br /&gt;
These questions can be used to..&lt;br /&gt;
