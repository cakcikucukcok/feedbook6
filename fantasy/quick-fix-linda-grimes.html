  <title>Quick Fix - Linda Grimes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;QUICK FIX--the second installment of the original urban fantasy series by LINDA GRIMES. &lt;br&gt;Ciel Halligan, an aura adaptor with a chameleon-like ability to step into the lives of her clients and fix their problems for them--&lt;i&gt;as&lt;/i&gt; them--is working a job at the National Zoo with her boyfriend, Billy, and his ten-year-old sister, Molly. It&#39;s supposed to be a quick fix, giving her time to decide if it&#39;s wise to pursue the romantic relationship her charming scoundrel of a best friend wants, or if she should give Mark, the CIA spook she&#39;s crushed on since hormones first rattled her pubescent brain, a chance to step up to the plate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molly has already begun to show signs of being an adaptor herself. She&#39;s young for it, but she&#39;s always been precocious, so it&#39;s not impossible. What &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; impossible is her taking on the form of the baby orangutan she touches--adaptors can only project &lt;i&gt;human&lt;/i&gt; auras. Until now, apparently. Worse, Molly is stuck in ape form. She can&#39;t change herself back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Escaping from the zoo with their new baby orang, Ciel and Billy head for New York City and the only person they know can help: Ciel&#39;s brother James, a non-adaptor scientist who&#39;s determined to crack the aura adaptor genetic code. But when Billy winds up in jail, accused of attempted murder, Ciel begins to suspect Molly&#39;s unusual adapting ability is more than just a fluke. Who&#39;s been experimenting on Molly, and what do they hope to gain? And will Ciel survive to find out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
