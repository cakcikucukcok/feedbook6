  <title>Journey’S Seekers - B. K. Parent, Katherine M. Parent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At the great summer fair in the capital city of Sommerhjem, the evil Regent is forced to step down due to the calling of the Gylden Sirklene challenge, leaving the future of the country hanging in the balance. One year to the day the challenge is called, all nine pieces of the oppgave ringe must be delivered to the capital. Four are already there, but five more need to be found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chance, a dreamer and adventure seeker, has been chosen by his family to return to Sommerhjem to retrieve a piece of the oppgave ringe his father hid before the family fled the country to escape certain demise. But what he thought would be a grand adventure turns out to be more than he bargained for; he is thrown into the brig on a smugglers ship, and that only marks the beginning of his troubles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Yara secures work in the royal library, where she secretly begins researching the whereabouts of a piece of the oppgave ringe her family was once charged with keeping safe. But what she eventually uncovers soon takes her and her fox companion, Toki, on a dangerous expedition to Sommerhjems border.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this continuing fantasy, two seekers embark on separate journeys to find treasured objects and return them to their rightful place without any idea of where life is about to take each of them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
