  <title>Storm Quest - Lisa Wright DeGroodt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Quests continue&lt;p&gt; 
Claire Jones has lived a difficult , albeit short, life. Orphaned, abandoned, left to drift through the foster care system, she has developed a hard outer shell designed to keep the world at bay. Yet this strength and resilience is just what the Land needs as it faces a series of devastating storms that cripple a Region and threaten the stability of the entire ecosystem.&lt;p&gt; 
Naturally skeptical, instinctively distrustful, Claire is far too young and far too unpredictable for the Protectors of the Land. Yet her ties to their group, and to the mystical dimension they are sworn to protect, is undeniable. With reluctance Claire is sent to the Land, where she must find a level of inner strength that belies age, defies her past, and embraces the possibilities. Finding friends and a sense of family along the way, Claire is faced with the most difficult decisions in her young life. The outcome will affect the fate of Claire, the Land, and even the World." />
