  <title>The Sword Stealers - Sean Woody</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When 14 year-old Dale Bonhams eccentric Uncle Ike buys her an unusual bottle at a garage sale, she is less than impressed. But Dale soon learns its terrifying secret after the bottle is accidentally broken and she is confronted with its prisoner, the malevolent and powerful Genie Lord Shrikescream. Together with her brother Dwayne, best friend Jill, and Uncle Ike, Dale finds herself caught in a deadly duel between Shrikescream and his archrival Lord Marcuros. At stake is the hand of the beautiful yet venomous Princess Allurie, heir to the Genie throne.
A dangerous and seemingly impossible quest lies before Dale and her friends. In only three days, they must find Excalibur, the sword of the legendary King Arthur for Shrikescream, so he may present it to the princess as a wedding gift. If the quest fails, Shrikescream promises the destruction of earth at his own hands.
Given a star sapphire alarm clock by Shrikescream to guide them on their quest, Dale and her friends are transported to a nightmare future where the vicious alien Mor-Drett have conquered earth, and the remnant of humanity battles against hopeless odds for their lives.
Dale and her friends must not only survive the Mor-drett, but also man-eating dinosaurs, poisonous fog, and worst of all, the wrath of Lord Marcuros, who tries to sabotage their quest. 
Along the way, three strange companions join in the search for the sword: a brazen Pooka named Nibs, his loyal friend William, and TShren Lightfoot, prince of an alien world and fugitive from the Mor-Drett.
Dale Bonham has never been one to surrender or compromise her beliefs. But against such adversity, how can she and her friends survive and ensure that life as she knows it will go on?" />
