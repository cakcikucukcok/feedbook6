  <title>Daughter of the Enemy - Sellipalayam R. Perumal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is it possible for an Indian Hindu woman to become the prime minister of Pakistan?
Yes! It happens in this novel. 
The story starts in Kuwait. In the year 1985, a Hindu Brahmin woman, due to the force of circumstances, married a Pakistani. They lived happily till Iraq occupied Kuwait in 1990. They came back to Pakistan. In Pakistan, she had to face religious fanatics. She took them head-on and succeeded. When things got settled, they returned to Kuwait. Again, due to Iraqi invasion by the USA in 2003, her husband was forced to come back to Pakistan. 
Mansoor, the fictional hero, interacted with the real characters of Pakistani politics. He entered into politics. He joined the PTI (party for Imran Khan) and worked hard for his success in Punjab. He could not agree with the policies of PTI. Therefore, he started his own party. With the active support of his wife, his party swept the general election held in 2018. Before he took oath, he was assassinated. Our heroine takes his place and becomes the prime minister of Pakistan, overcoming the initial legal resistance with the help of womens power. She brought the military under her control. She waged a war against militants, religious fanatics, and the Talibanand succeeded. 
She was not satisfied with her achievements. She wanted to change the political history of South Asian nations. She decided to form United South Asian Republics (USAR).
Read the book to know whether she succeeded or not." />
