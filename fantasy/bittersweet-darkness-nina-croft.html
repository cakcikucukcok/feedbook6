  <title>Bittersweet Darkness - Nina Croft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are no monsters, only good guys and bad guys. That&#39;s the creed by which Detective Inspector Faith Connolly has always lived. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Faith discovers she has a time bomb counting down in her head, she has one goal: to solve the murder case she&#39;s working on and gain closure. Her investigation brings her in contact with Ash Delacourt, who is definitely one of the bad guys, albeit a stunningly gorgeous one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As payment for a debt, Asmodai, AKA Ash Delacourt, finds himself working with the Order of the Shadow Accords. He&#39;s the demon representative on the newly formed committee for the integration of mankind and well...everything else. It&#39;s a chance to be near his daughter, make a new start, and--once he&#39;s met the delectable Detective Connolly--maybe have a little fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Faith&#39;s investigation deepens, her beliefs are eroded and for the first time, she is falling in love--with one of the bad guys. How can she ever let Ash close when her time is running out...?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Order series is best enjoyed in order.&lt;br&gt;Reading Order:&lt;br&gt;Book #1 Bittersweet Blood&lt;br&gt;Book #2 Bittersweet Magic&lt;br&gt;Book #3 Bittersweet Darkness&lt;br&gt;Book #4 Bittersweet Christmas&lt;/p&gt;" />
