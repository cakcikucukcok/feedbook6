  <title>Nathaniel Ages - Brandie Lagarde</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God granted the angel Nathaniel Ages the gift of persuasion, but it is precisely this gift that has caused his separation from God. For centuries, Nathaniel has questioned his purpose and lamented his inability to intervene on behalf of humankind. Why would God give him this wondrous gift, yet deny him use of it? Exercising his free will, Nathaniel has withdrawn from his relationship with his Father. He has lived through centuries as a thirty-three-year-old single doctor, but has found nowhere to belong. Cut off from his Creator, Nathaniel is subject to Lucifers unceasing efforts to recruit him into his own unholy army. 
But when twenty-five-year-old nurse Kate Jennings literally falls into Nathaniels arms, she turns his world upside-down. In Kates presence, Nathaniel experiences a gamut of new, unexpected, and challenging emotions and finds a kindred spirit who has also turned away from God in the face of tragedy. 
Kate finds herself torn between Nathaniel and her boyfriend Logan, a devoted Christian. She and Nathaniel both realize they must reassess faith and faithfulness, the questioning of God, and their separation from the Father. Can Nathaniel and Kate reconcile their feelings without endangering their souls and elude the greatest evil of all?" />
