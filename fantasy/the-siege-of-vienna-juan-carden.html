  <title>The Siege of Vienna - Juan Carden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    The Siege of Vienna begins in 1769 with the birth of Napoleon Bonaparte and our hero who will eventually become Napoleons nemesis. The two men are in
    love with the same woman and in their zeal to obtain the object of their love their armies clash, thus changing forever the physiognomy of Europe and the
    destiny of the world. The action takes place during a time period when the music of Mozart and Beethoven filled the air with emotion and when men and women
    dedicate
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The author entangles fiction with history during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century to narrate the adventures of two immortals that come into
    the world to fight for what is right for them and for the world. They dedicate their lives to living, loving, creating and fighting. While Napoleon wanted
    to secure power for France for centuries to come, little did he know he would be facing our hero? With Napoleon conquest to subdue the European nobility,
    our hero must be concerned in the safety of his family and his nation. While Napoleon covets his wife, our hero negotiates with the emperor for the peace
    of Europe.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    This historical period when the novel takes place is full of romance, where a noble means all, and the master will be well served. Its a time when a
    minority has almost everything and the commoners suffer from misery and poverty. The more advance the civilization is the more conflicts are created and
    more ideological, military, social, religious and political differences are noticeable. With the industrial revolution, the distances become smaller and
    the prevailing strength of a single empire is more difficult, as it is the tasks of the protagonists of this novel.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    The author again brings up another time, with different customs, different characters, but with the same ambitions, resentments, desires and frustrations.
    This time love is driven by a sublime music that surrounds us in an infinite passion that transforms our senses.
