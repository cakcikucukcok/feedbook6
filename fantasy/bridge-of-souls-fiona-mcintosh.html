  <title>Bridge of Souls - Fiona McIntosh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Wyl Thirsk, former general of the Morgravian army and bearer of the curse known as Myrren&#39;s gift, is running out of time. Marriage between his beloved Queen Valentyna and his sworn enemy, the despotic King Celimus, is imminent; yet, despite the impending nuptials, war looms between the two nations, while the threat from the Mountain Kingdom grows stronger. Trapped in a body not his own, with his friends and supporters scattered throughout the realm, Wyl is as desperate to prevent the wedding as he is to end Myrren&#39;s &quot;gift&quot; -- a magic that will cease only when he assumes the throne of Morgravia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinging to an ominous suggestion from his young friend Fynch, an increasingly powerful mage, Wyl must walk his most dangerous path yet -- straight into the brutal clutches of Celimus in a desperate attempt to save his nation, his love, and himself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
