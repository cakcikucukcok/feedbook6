  <title>The Facebook Suicides - Ethan Tyler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Millions of people, children and adults suffer from depression. It does not matter if you&#39;re young or old; female or male. It does not apply to specific countries nor races.   The invisibility of this illness makes it ever so deadly. It is highly undetected and wildly misunderstood due to the inability of sufferers to fully explain and describe what they go through.   People reject and fight the Big D, they try to lead a normal life and integrate into the fabrics of society. They wear a mask of smile in public and with friends, family. Yet when in solitude, the unbearable and prolonged period of sadness floods the mind and it is uncontrollable.   The Facebook Suicides is a labyrinth of reality blurred with fantasy; it seeks to raise awareness of a real society issue in a whimsical and ironic tone." />
