  <title>Invasion of the Ortaks:  Book 3 Rebellion - Sveinn Benónýsson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The battle of Broad Valley has been fought and lost, and the brutal Ortaks stand victorious.  But though the Esthopian forces have been defeated, they are not destroyed. As the Ortaks plunder their lands, the fragments of the defeated armies unite under the leadership of the young commander Axel, forming a rebel force against the invaders.  Desperate to aid them, their queen takes on a dangerous journey to cross the Great Mountains to join them in the battle at Crown City. At the same time, the hero Big John fights his way through Ortaks and outlaws in a seemingly hopeless attempt to save Sir William from certain death. We also learn about the part-Elven Tania, about her journey from childhood to become a captain of the Elven army and about her time in the monastery in Big Canyon. Meanwhile, as the armies of the Ortaks secure their footholds in Esthopia, the forces from the Underworld grow stronger by the day." />
