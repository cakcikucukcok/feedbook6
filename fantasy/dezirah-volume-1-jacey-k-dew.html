  <title>Dezirah Volume 1 - Jacey K Dew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A millennium and a half ago, supernatural beings signed a treaty to disappear. The general public was told they were wiped out, and over time their existence became stories, myths, legends, fairy tale, fable, and movie plot.&lt;br /&gt; New generations and some nostalgic individuals decide to take back their place in society. They will chant Dezirah as they revolt against the humans.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Supernatural beings throw the world into World War III like no one imagines. A supernatural revolution now threatens life as humans know it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The plight to survive in a world ravaged by a supernatural war, as told from different points of view of Alexa Brenner, Nikki Marshall, and Jaiden Kensington.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Follow Alexa, a teenager whose world is in constant upheaval; from her family dying and being caught in the foster system with her young niece, to a supernatural war distmantling her way of life. Now she needs to choose between her vampire boyfriend and her humanity while struggling to survive in an unfair war.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Follow Nikki as she&amp;nbsp;grasps for her old life as she survives the supernatural revolution alongside&amp;nbsp;three friends. She leads a group through denial, and disbelief of the events going on outside the mall.&amp;nbsp;Embracing, then tolerating a party atmosphere may prove disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Follow Jaiden as she finds herself, while thrust between supernaturals and humans. Dealing with multiple races and species, she finds&amp;nbsp;herself questioning who she should fear more; the humans, the wwerewolves, the succubus, the vampires, ore the various other beings she encounters.&amp;nbsp;The nightmares that plague her&amp;nbsp;only show a glimpse of what is to come.&lt;/p&gt;" />
