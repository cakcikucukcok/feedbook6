  <title>Remmie, a Southern Heiress - Brenda Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Having spent all her life in foster care or group homes, Remmie had every reason to be angry. Life had not been kind to the lovely auburn-haired girl, but the Remingtons had given her another chance at life with every advantage. The wealthy doctor and his wife adopted Remmie when she was eleven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remmie&#39;s life changed instantly. River Oaks, a lovely estate on the Chattahoochee River, became her home. Not only did the Remingtons provide for her, they loved her, and she loved them. She excelled at everything she did. Pursuing a medical career at age nineteen was difficult, but Remmie had her mind set to finish ahead of schedule, which she did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remmie was sure a busy career as a trauma surgeon would keep her mind off her past. Unfortunately, she lived with uncertainty and fear of failure. She was haunted by feelings of being abandoned. Why didnt her biological parents love her? How could people just abandon their child?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Remmie&#39;s desire to know who she is and where she came from takes her on a journey far from River Oaks, she remains true to herself and true to her God, but more than that, she learns what forgiveness truly is.&lt;/p&gt;" />
