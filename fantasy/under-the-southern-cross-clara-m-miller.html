  <title>Under the Southern Cross - Clara M. Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Under the Southern Cross,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; the eighth book in the Brothers Series and the fourth in the Shamrocks Saga, continues the story begun in Shamrocks in the Heather with the adventures of the rapidly maturing younger members of the Quigley clan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
	World War II is now in full swing and the Quigley cousins (by whatever name theyre known) volunteer for duty in the armed forces: Andrew, Finn and Doug in the RAF, Dennis in the Royal Navy and Geordie in the Army. Roarke, trapped in Australia by the outbreak of war, joins the coastwatchers in the Solomon Islands. This job, vital to the war effort and extremely dangerous, keep Martin, Anne and the twins on tenterhooks. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;	Whether due to old age or the toll taken by the stress of war, the family suffers many deaths. The younger generation suffers greatly as well as they perform their various stints in the military. In the meantime, the demon inhabiting the soul of Adolph Hitler is beginning to believe the Nazis are no longer going to win the war. He takes desperate and sometimes foolish measures to try to rectify the deteriorating situation. Lucifer, ever practical, decides to hedge his bet by looking at Stalin as a new would-be ally in his war to establish the Rule of Chaos. The Spear of Destiny will play a role in the outcome of the war and many forces are determined to gain control of the mystical weapon. What no one counts on is the interference of the Quigley twins. Dora and Dosia are set on reclaiming the Spear for its original owner.
	&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While a vicious war turns London into matchsticks and mainland Europe into hell-on-earth, a semi-normal life goes on. People, Quigleys included, marry and have children. Their traveling is curtailed by shortages of fuel; their gatherings are more subdued with less food and fewer gifts but a semblance of normalcy is stubbornly adhered to. So, the battle between good and evil goes on. On one side is the Prince of Hell and his faithful (?) Lieutenant Beelzebub. Or is he faithful? Hes beginning to develop a reluctant admiration for the twins and even begins to like them. On the other side are the Quigleys, their Angels and the two wild-cards: Dora and Dosia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	What happens to the Spear will have great bearing on the future of mankind although no one really realizes that and the twins want to keep it that way. They know this is not the last time theyll have to face and fight Lucifer and his minions but they take one day at a time, one challenge at a time while whispering the Quigley lullaby Whisht now, whisht.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	This is not a religious book nor meant to endorse or promote any type of belief. It is intended to provide a verbal roller-coaster ride. Plus, Ive grown to quite like The Old Man. Enjoy!" />
