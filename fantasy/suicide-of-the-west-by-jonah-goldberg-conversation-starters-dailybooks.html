Two-time New York Times bestselling author Jonah Goldberg his newest book Suicide of the West: How The Rebirth Of Tribalism, Populism, Nationalism, And Identity Politics Is Destroying American Democracy. Goldberg makes a case that only once in the last 250,000 years have humans found the miracle of liberal democratic capitalism. It is the way we lifted ourselves out of the endless cycle of poverty, hunger, and war that defines most of history. However, Goldberg writes that American democracy and other democracies are threatened by different ideologies - &amp;nbsp;populism, authoritarianism, tribalism, among others.&lt;br /&gt;
Yuval Levin of National Review calls Goldberg&amp;rsquo;s Suicide of The West &amp;ldquo;a conservative classic.&amp;rdquo; David Brooks of New York Times describes it as &amp;ldquo;epic and debate-shifting.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
