  <title>Astrum Divinus - John D Christopher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="All his life, Dr. Peter Northcott has been plagued by disturbing dreamsapocalyptic scenes of angels and demons and visions of fire and blood. Concentrating on his scholarly life in Rome, Peter is approaching his thirty-third birthday when he is accosted by a mysterious priest. 
Father Renauld claims to have important information regarding Peters destiny. He spins a tale of secret societies and ancient texts and enemies who not only threaten Peter himself but the whole of creation.
Peter retreats to his adopted parents home in England. Even there, he is haunted by dreams of Armageddon. His parents beg him to listen to the priests story. Can these intelligent people really believe in a war of cosmic proportions? What was the true motivation behind Peters adoption? 
Reluctantly, Peter visits a subterranean cavern, situated deep in the bowels of the Pyrenees Mountains, to retrieve an ancient scroll. Records of fire, murder, and secrets echo Peters visions, but can he really be the divine star, the savior of the world? 
The idea is unthinkable, but what if it is true? What if he is the Astrum Divinus?" />
