  <title>The Radiant Dawn - J. Eifie Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Humanity teeters on the brink of extinction. At the call of demon worshipers Aaron and Stacie Murphy, the dead have risen from the cemeteries across the world. In one short year, they have overtaken most of the world, and only a couple bastions of human power remain. Most of the world is a wasteland of undead. When the last humans die, the worshipers will be able to summon their lord to Earth.
Behind the walls of her father&#39;s great fortress, heiress Dawn Cahill is prepared for war. Surviving humans have gathered at Light&#39;s Bulwark, and man the guns against the undead menace. Dawn believes her fortress can hold the dead back, but has no ambitions of stepping out from within her walls to challenge the royals in combat. They wield powerful magic and feel no pain, and Dawn&#39;s brigade faces unfathomable odds, flying stone constructs, and monstrous flesh golems that can shatter rock and steel like glass.
But there is a power sleeping within her fortress, in a statue in her courtyard. The statue holds the power of the Solari, an ancient Greek warrior class who called upon Apollo&#39;s power to fight. By awakening this power, Dawn has magic of her own to fight the undead. The magic granted her the power to soar through the air, strike with tremendous power, and heal the wounds of her allies at a touch.
Is it enough? Can humanity survive the greatest threat to its existence? Or will the dead and their demonic overlords claim this world as their own?" />

    	<p>Humanity teeters on the brink of extinction. At the call of demon worshipers Aaron and Stacie Murphy, the dead have risen from the cemeteries across the world. In one short year, they have overtaken most of the world, and only a couple bastions of human power remain. Most of the world is a wasteland of undead. When the last humans die, the worshipers will be able to summon their lord to Earth. Behind the walls of her father's great fortress, heiress Dawn Cahill is prepared for war. Surviving humans have gathered at Light's Bulwark, and man the guns against the undead menace. Dawn believes her fortress can hold the dead back, but has no ambitions of stepping out from within her walls to challenge the royals in combat. They wield powerful magic and feel no pain, and Dawn's brigade faces unfathomable odds, flying stone constructs, and monstrous flesh golems that can shatter rock and steel like glass. But there is a power sleeping within her fortress, in a statue in her courtyard. The statue holds the power of the Solari, an ancient Greek warrior class who called upon Apollo's power to fight. By awakening this power, Dawn has magic of her own to fight the undead. The magic granted her the power to soar through the air, strike with tremendous power, and heal the wounds of her allies at a touch. Is it enough? Can humanity survive the greatest threat to its existence? Or will the dead and their demonic overlords claim this world as their own?</p>
