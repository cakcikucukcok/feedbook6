  <title>Tall, Dark, Deadly Alpha - Donna Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tall, Dark, Deadly Alpha is a collection of the first three novels in the Reaper series from &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Donna Grant!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;There is no escaping a Reaper. We are elite assassins, part of a brotherhood that only answers to Death. And when Death says your time is up, we are coming for you...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dark Alpha&#39;s Claim&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Baylon&#39;s whole existence is based on taking what Death wants. Born to eliminate Fae guilty of unforgivable crimes, his reckless, wild nature makes him the perfect assassin to carry out Death&#39;s bidding. But when he lays eyes on Jordyn, he&#39;s never wanted a woman-never mind a human-so badly. A Reaper saving Jordyn&#39;s life will only attract danger, but Baylon vows to protect her at all costs from the Fae that hunt her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dark Alpha&#39;s Embrace&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kyran is a warrior. As a Reaper who does Death&#39;s bidding, weakness is a word he doesn&#39;t understand. Until stunning librarian River White stirs emotions deep within him he&#39;s never felt before. But underneath those wide eyes and fierce femininity, she has a weapon, one she won&#39;t hesitate to use. And when the Dark begin their deadly descent, Kyran and River need each other&#39;s love and protection...or risk fracturing apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dark Alpha&#39;s Demand&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talen exists to exact vengeance on the Fae for their wrongs per Death&#39;s orders - a fearsome Fae.  But Neve captured his soul with just a look from her seductive gaze, and Talen has never wanted, never hungered for anyone else more than her.  But someone has set out to kill her - and expose Talen. But he&#39;ll stop at nothing to destroy any man - human or Fae - who brings harm to her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
