  <title>Prophecy of the Dark King - Adalberto Medina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A fate foretold may not always remain true.
Seventeen-year-old Maximus Kazehara has always been a carefree person without worry or doubt.  Unfortunately, fate has a way of sneaking up on those unsuspected.  Every few years the kingdom of Azure would hold a ceremony of magic when all young azurian create a contract with an elemental spirit.  During the ceremony two spirits appeared to him yet one was feared throughout the kingdom.  The spirit of darkness he would receive changed his life in mere moments forcing him to leave his home.
Now Maximus must travel to the academy of magic in Manas.  Once there he could find the answers needed to discover the reason for receiving such an elemental spirit. His journey would take him through the land of Terrene and test the courage in his heart
Why did the spirit of darkness appear to Maximus?  What fate does the dark spirit have for Maximus?
Take a peek beyond the Prophecy of the Dark King.  Life will never be the same." />
