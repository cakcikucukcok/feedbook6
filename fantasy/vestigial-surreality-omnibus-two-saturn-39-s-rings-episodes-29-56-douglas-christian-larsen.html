  <title>Vestigial Surreality: Omnibus Two: Saturn&#39;s Rings: Episodes 29-56 - Douglas Christian Larsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Omnibus Two: Saturn&#39;s Rings. Episodes 29-56.  Reality, what a concept. Is life a puppet show and are we nothing but puppets?  And now, the Simulation Hypothesis plagues us. Could we really be living in a computer simulation? Through the ages, the conundrum of Reality has messed with the collective consciousness of humanity. Descartes Evil Demon. The Allegory of Plato&#39;s Cave down through the ages to The Matrix.  A chance meeting in the park leads two strangers to discover strange connections between themselves and the world, and in truth both had felt that perhaps there was something not quite right with the world, something different. They have both noticed improbable coincidences popping up in their lives, at an almost alarming regularity, and now, meeting, they witness strange signs in the heavens, and find themselves on a bizarre path that will make them question their very reality, and the reality of the world about them, and the universe itself." />
