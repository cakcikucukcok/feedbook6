  <title>James and the Hidden Island of Pangenia - Jason Lee Purvis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anaptra dreamt. Not the kind of dreams you would expect a fourteen-year-old girl would have, even one that had seen the end of the world. No, Anaptras dreams were more like visions, almost memories. 
She saw a small boy surviving alone in the desolate streets of Hong Kong, forced to run with pack-dogs, the dominant species in the area. Now all the humans were gone. 
She saw another boy, around her own age, who lived in an ancient volcano on a hidden island and whose best friends were creatures she knew only existed in fairytales and fantasy games. 
These boys were like her, special, gifted. They were the future. 
She had wandered Africa for the seven years since the war. Her father was the only other human she knew, and her best friend was a juvenile cheetah, but that was all about to change. Today she would meet Ivan, the leader of the resistance and the person who would bring her dreams crashing into her reality." />
