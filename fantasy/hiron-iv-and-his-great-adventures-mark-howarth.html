  <title>Hiron Iv and His Great Adventures - Mark Howarth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Follow the adventures of the heroic Hiron IV in two separate, but complete stories as he battles against evil: Hiron and the Lightning God It is a dark time in the world, and an evil lightning god is leading a demon army into battle with men. The men are very powerful. King Aruban the leader of the army of men, comes face to face with the demon god Alatt. Aruban takes a very powerful swing with his sword, and knocks Alatts sword out of his hand. He then picks up the sword of Alatt and destroys him with it, or does he ... 400 years later King Aruban&#39;s descendant, Prince Hiron finds an old piece of paper which describes the body of Alatt being split into pieces before being scattered far and wide. Soon after Hiron&#39;s discovery, it becomes apparent the demons are trying to gather together the pieces of their former master in an effort to re-build him and bring him back to life. The task of stopping them now falls to Hiron. Will he succeed in preventing the evil Lightning God from walking the earth once again? Hiron and the Sorcerer of Darkness In the 4th dimension a sorcerer of terrible dark, magic powers attempts to destroy the world, but must first face the great King Aruban and his ally in this dimension, the demon lightning god Alatt. Together with their armies of men and demons, they banish the sorcerer to the 1st dimension where they believe he has already been defeated. The sorcerer has created his own army of creatures known as Rooshtangs. Both he and his army arrive through a portal into the 1st dimension in the time of King Hiron IV, of Hantell. Hiron, who has already fought many battles, must now take on the evil Sorcerer of Darkness, but finds the only way to defeat him, is with a weapon from his own dimension. How will Hiron possibly find a way to get hold of such a weapon?" />
