  <title>A Poisonous Echo - Mai Griffin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Joyce is angry that her boss won&amp;#39;t leave his wife, so his wife will have to be removed... one way or another!&lt;br /&gt;
A poisoning is planned and Joyce sets out to leave a lasting impression... then Joyce goes missing... A malevolent ghost and psychic detectives form the core of this enjoyable stand-alone sequel to Mai Griffin&amp;#39;s Ghostly Echoes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Originally published as A Poisonous Shade of Grey, the second of the ORIGINAL Shades of Grey series &amp;ndash; long before any of a number of other Shades of Grey were published by other people, this book is a Ghost Story &amp;ndash; with little or no sadomasochism in its content! Well, to be precise, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t any! We, the publishers and the Author, give up. Our books came first &amp;ndash; our titles were out first &amp;ndash; our books are beautifully written and crafted &amp;ndash; and we are fed-up with the assumption that this series is in some way a spinoff from any other when, in fact &amp;ndash; we repeat &amp;ndash; it was written and published FIRST!&lt;br /&gt;
In whatever order you read her books, Mai Griffin&amp;rsquo;s series of supernatural thrillers, Ghostly Echoes, will grip you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
