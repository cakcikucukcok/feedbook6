      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;For twenty years Destiny Carlton has put family and duty ahead of her own hopes and dreams. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now with the orphaned nephews she raised grown and married, it&#39;s time for the once free-spirited artist to reinvent herself yet again, this time as a savvy businesswoman out for revenge. Her target–William Harcourt, a man she once loved, a man who now seems hell-bent on destroying her family&#39;s business.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For William, going after Carlton Industries is a highstakes gamble. He&#39;s gotten Destiny&#39;s attention, but he&#39;s also infuriated her family. Now they stand firmly between him and his real goal–winning Destiny&#39;s heart. William has set the corporate game in motion, but suddenly he&#39;s playing by Destiny&#39;s rules. And when an unpredictable woman&#39;s fury has been unleashed, who knows what unexpected twists life might take?&lt;/p&gt;
