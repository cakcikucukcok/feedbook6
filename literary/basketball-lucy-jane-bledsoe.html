  <title>Basketball - Lucy Jane Bledsoe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="BJ, a talented college basketball player, lives and breathes the game.  For BJ, life means nothing without hoops.  Her mother-an abstract painter-doesn&#39;t get it.  Or at least she pretends she doesn&#39;t. Everything changes when BJ accidentally discovers her dad, a man who&#39;s been a shadowy presence throughout her life. As if that&#39;s not enough of a surprise, she begins to suspect that two of her teammates, and her best friends, may actually be her half-sisters.  As BJ struggles to keep her eye on the ball-literally-her life heads into overtime." />
