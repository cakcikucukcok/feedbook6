  <title>Chase and Haven - Michael Blouin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haven is fiercely protective of her little brother, Chase, spiriting him away when their father&amp;#8217;s temper is about to flare yet again. She hides the bread away so he&amp;#8217;ll have something for lunch, and she teaches him to hide himself. But when that&amp;#8217;s no longer enough to keep him safe, she steals the car and takes them both away to their aunt, Mary, who tries her best to love and nurture them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They try to redeem their harrowing childhood in different ways: Haven, lost and damaged, goes to medical school and teacher&amp;#8217;s college, and marries young, hoping to find meaning through her daughter, April. Chase battles his demons through cathartic but doomed performance art. And, always, they try to keep one another afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Chase and Haven&lt;/I&gt; is a haunting story &amp;#150; inventively told and deeply felt &amp;#150; of suffering and love, made of thousands of small impressionist facets that refract the quiet spectrum of the beauty and the detritus of two entwined lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
