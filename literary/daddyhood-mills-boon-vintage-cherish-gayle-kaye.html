          &lt;strong&gt;A NEWFOUND FAMILY…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Suddenly, divorced dad Gabe Lawrence was more than a part-time father…. He and his adorable girls were now a full-time family! Seeking advice on raising his six-year-old twins, he turned to Dr. Sabrina Moore–noted expert on kids.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gabe thought the good doctor&#39;s theories were a little off. So to bring her research back to reality, he invited Sabrina to observe his fledgling family and get to know his daughters.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Sabrina was more than Gabe ever expected–her eyes, her smile and the funny thing she did to his heart…where had that come from? He would bet his newfound daddyhood that her research shouldn&#39;t include distracting him with her kisses…or making him fall in love with her! Should it?&lt;/p&gt;
