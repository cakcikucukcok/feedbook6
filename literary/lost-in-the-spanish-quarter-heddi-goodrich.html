  <title>Lost in the Spanish Quarter - Heddi Goodrich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As seen in the&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;New York Times Book Review.&amp;#160;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set in the passionate, intense, and crumbling neighborhood known as the Spanish Quarter of Naples, comes a tale of two students searching for love and belonging in the city they so desperately want to call home.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Years after leaving Naples with a broken heart, Heddi receives an email from her first love. Although she now lives in New Zealand, just the thought of the Spanish Quarter&amp;#8217;s narrow, winding streets sparks the pain of longing. Heddi had found her place in that city built on Roman ruins and set against a sleeping volcano. A place she wants to call home despite being &lt;em&gt;l&amp;#8217;americana &lt;/em&gt;or the American. For Heddi&amp;#8217;s group of university friends, Naples is either a refuge from their familial responsibilities or an entryway to a wider world. But for all of them, Naples was their real university of life: the setting of their unrestrained youth. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Heddi first met Pietro at a party hosted by her bohemian roommates, she was inexplicably drawn to the serious geology student. Despite coming from wildly different backgrounds&amp;#8212;Heddi, a nomadic American; Pietro, an Italian farm boy&amp;#8212;the two fell into a liberating romance. She was searching for the roots she never had, while he tried to escape his. Yet even after the two were doomed to part ways, their story isn&amp;#8217;t finished just yet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by her own 10-year search for belonging in Naples, author Heddi Goodrich gives readers a passionate tale of a life caught between two worlds and a heartfelt ode to first love&amp;#8212;of a place, of a person&amp;#8212; where languages and cultures collide while dreams soar and crash in unexpected ways.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#160;" />
