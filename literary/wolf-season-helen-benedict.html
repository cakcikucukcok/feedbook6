  <title>Wolf Season - Helen Benedict</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#147;No one writes with more authority or cool-eyed compassion about the experience of women in war both on and off the battlefield than Helen Benedict. In &lt;I&gt;Wolf Season&lt;/I&gt;, she shows us the complicated ways in which the lives of those who serve and those who don&#39;t intertwine and how&amp;#151;regardless of whether you are a soldier, the family of a soldier, or a refugee&amp;#151;the war follows you and your children for generations. &lt;I&gt;Wolf Season&lt;/I&gt; is more than a novel for our times; it should be required reading.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;Elissa Schappell&lt;/B&gt;, author of &lt;I&gt;Use Me&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Blueprints for Building Better Girls&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;Fierce and vivid and full of hope, this story of trauma and resilience, of love and family, of mutual aid and solidarity in the aftermath of a brutal war is nothing short of magic. Helen Benedict is the voice of an American conscience that has all too often been silenced. To read these pages is to be transported to a world beyond hype and propaganda to see the human cost of war up close. This is not a novel that allows you to walk away unchanged.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;Cara Hoffman&lt;/B&gt;, author of &lt;I&gt;Be Safe I Love You&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Running&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;&lt;I&gt;Wolf Season&lt;/I&gt; delves into the complexities and murk of the after-war with blazing clarity. You will come to treasure these characters for their strengths and foibles alike.&amp;#8221; &amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;Matt Gallagher&lt;/B&gt;, author of &lt;I&gt;Kaboom&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;Youngblood&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After a hurricane devastates a small town in upstate New York, the lives of three women and their young children are irrevocably changed. Rin, an Iraq War veteran, tries to protect her blind daughter and the three wolves under her care. Naema, a widowed doctor who fled Iraq with her wounded son, faces life-threatening injuries. Beth, who is raising a troubled son, waits out her Marine husband&amp;#8217;s deployment in Afghanistan, equally afraid of him coming home and of him never returning at all. As they struggle to maintain their humanity and find hope, their war-torn lives collide in a way that will affect their entire community.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Helen Benedict&lt;/B&gt; is the author of seven novels, including &lt;I&gt;Sand Queen&lt;/I&gt;, a &lt;I&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/I&gt; &amp;#147;Best Contemporary War Novel&amp;#8221;; five works of nonfiction about justice, women, soldiers, and war; and the play &lt;I&gt;The Lonely Soldier Monologues: Women at War in Iraq&lt;/I&gt;. She lives in New York.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
