  <title>Changing Faces - Kimberla Lawson Roby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Meet Whitney, Taylor, and Charisse, three women who have been best friends since high school. However, this devoted troika is about to discover a wave of unexpected troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney is a plus-size woman who just can&#39;t turn down a box of Krispy Kremes or find a man who will stay put.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taylor is in a long-term relationship with a boyfriend who&#39;s allergic to commitment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Charisse is married, with two adorable children, but somehow doesn&#39;t have what she really wants&amp;#8212;or needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then suddenly Charisse spins out of control. Her doormat husband manages to stand up to her and even threatens to go public with a very shady secret Charisse had hoped to keep hidden, especially from her interfering mother. Desperate, she decides that only a very risky scheme will save her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One constant for these women has been the support they&#39;ve offered one another. But this time, how far can friendship go?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this witty, rollicking, deeply poignant story, Kimberla Lawson Roby demonstrates the storytelling magic that has won her legions of adoring fans and made her novels bestsellers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
