  <title>A Wild People - Hugh Leonard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This rich, mature novel follows a few years in the life of T. J. Quill, a middle-aged Dubliner trapped in a passionless marriage, who is soon lured into an affair with the voluptuous Josie, a woman he only half-understands. Meanwhile, through a doomed friendship with a producer named &quot;Thorn&quot; Thornton, Quill becomes embrangled with a staging of a Plautus satire (retitled Lust). It&#39;s a memorable production which premieres outdoors, at night, during a hurricane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But just when Quill&#39;s career seems on the skids, it receives a much-needed boost when he is hired as the archivist to the late, great Western filmmaker, Sean O&#39;Fearna, and finds himself matching wits with the director&#39;s flamboyant and feckless widow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a darkly comic tale of fluctuating friendships and rivalries on Dublin&#39;s creative fringes that makes subtle jabs at people&#39;s desire to reinvent themselves. Hugh Leonard has written an extraordinary first novel about marriage, adultery, friendship, and a lifelong love of film. &lt;i&gt;A Wild People&lt;/i&gt; is a brilliant, modern novel of manners by one of Ireland&#39;s most prominent and popular playwrights.&lt;/p&gt;" />
