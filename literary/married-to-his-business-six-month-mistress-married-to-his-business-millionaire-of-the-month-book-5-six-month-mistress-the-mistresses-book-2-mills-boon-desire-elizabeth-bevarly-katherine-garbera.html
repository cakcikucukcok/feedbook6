          &lt;strong&gt;Be swept away by passion… with intense drama and compelling plots, these emotionally powerful reads will keep you captivated from beginning to end.&lt;/strong&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Married to His Business &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Bevarly Matthias Barton’s dependable assistant of five years was taking another job – with the competition. Matthias felt incensed, betrayed and, shockingly, a little jealous. How had his feelings veered from professional to personal? Newfound lust begat determination. He would win her back – by any means necessary. Six-Month Mistress Katherine Garbera Years ago, in a desperate move, Bella McNamara had agreed to become millionaire Jeremy Harper’s temporary mistress. He would never know she’d fallen madly in love with him even before she’d signed herself away.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But now, finally, she had six very intimate months to work on her own plan: becoming Jeremy’s beloved wife.&lt;/p&gt;
