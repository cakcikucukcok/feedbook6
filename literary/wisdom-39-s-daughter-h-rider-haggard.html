But it's a good idea to read both 'She' and 'The Return of She' first. 'She and Allan' is pure Haggard but not essential to enjoying the novel.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Wisdom's Daughter (Dodo Press) (9781905432806 ...</i></b> | Wisdom's Daughter is a fantasy novel by British writer H. Rider Haggard, published in 1923, by Hutchinson &amp; Co in the UK and Doubleday, Page and Company in the US. It is the final published book in the Ayesha series but chronologically the first book in the series.<br /><b><i>Wisdom's Daughter - Wikipedia</i></b> | Wisdom's Daughter is arguably the best novel he wrote. Comparable to King's Soloman's Mines and it surpasses the original "She" focus and readability, without out being overly florid as much of his earlier works. It is the best by far in the "She" series, however "Ayesha" is the true sequel to "She", the others are more companions to them ...<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Wisdom&#39;s Daughter - H.
