  <title>The Italian Chapel - Philip Paris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Domenico Chiocchetti was a quiet, kindly man, an Italian artist caught up in a war that would change his life forever. When he and his friends and fellow prisoners of war arrived on the tiny Orkney island of Lamb Holm in January 1942, they found a freezing, windswept wilderness and a seemingly impossible task -to build giant causeways in the sea to protect the British Navy. It was a life seemingly without hope, until the arrival of Padre Giacomo. When the Padre arrived he brought a new hope for the future and helped Domenico persuade the British to allow him to build a chapel. Little did they know the extent of Domenico&#39;s extraordinary vision. And for the men of Camp 60 it was a story of triumph over adversity as, far from home, this small group of soldiers created a remarkable legacy - a masterpiece in plasterboard and scrap metal - and a lasting reminder of the true strength of the human spirit." />
