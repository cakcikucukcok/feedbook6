  <title>Solitaria - Genni Gunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Vito Santoro&#39;s body is inadvertently unearthed by a demolition crew in Fregene, Italy, his siblings are thrown into turmoil, having been told by their sister Piera that Vito had fled to Argentina fifty years earlier after abandoning his wife and son. Piera, the self-proclaimed matriarch, locks herself in her room, refusing to speak to anyone but her Canadian nephew, David. Now scattered over three continents, the family members regroup in Italy to try to discover the truth. They all arrive rife with their own resentments and conflicting desires: Aldo, the successful barrister everyone leans on; Teresa, the angry, abandoned wife; Renato, who lost Teresa to his brother Vito; Mimi, the bitter, ironic baby of the family; Clarissa, the famous opera diva whose peripatetic life had her frequently leaving her son David in the care of Piera; and David, who reluctantly accompanies his mother to Italy to bury his long-lost uncle. Set against the countryside of Italy&#39;s Adriatic coast, &lt;i&gt;Solitaria&lt;/i&gt; is a tale of longing and family honour, told from two points of view: Piera&#39;s and David&#39;s. With the unravelling of their stories, we glimpse a woman&#39;s growing awareness of her own capacity for self-delusion, and of the consequences of her actions on others, and a young man&#39;s awakening to the depth of his roots.&lt;/p&gt;" />
