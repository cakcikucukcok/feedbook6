  <title>The Swinging Bridge - Ramabai Espinet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mona, a film researcher rooted in Montreal, vividly remembers that night in Trinidad when her father, Da-Da, in a drunken rage, threatened to kill her nine-year-old brother, Kello. Years later, a terminally ill Kello asks Mona to revisit their native island and reclaim the property that their family had left behind. As Mona returns to the Caribbean to confront her family&#39;s turbulent past, the reader travels back in time—to nineteenth-century India, to British Trinidad, where her ancestors lived as indentured workers in the cane fields, and finally to urban North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steeped in the lyrical rhythms of Caribbean life, this exquisite, richly layered novel explores the immigrant experience with compassion and humour. It is a moving story of race and displacement, of love and betrayal, of endings and beginnings—a swinging bridge of the universal search for self.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praise for&lt;em&gt;The Swinging Bridge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Beautiful, luminous and an utter pleasure to read.
