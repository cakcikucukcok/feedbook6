  <title>All Girls Should Know How to Braid - Tonya Holloway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stacy Bell was a typical eighties teenager.  She had a colossal crush on Michael Jackson and teaching herself to break-dancewas a daily ritual.  Like most girls her age, she fantasized about being the prettiest, most fashionable, and the most popular seventh grader at Forest Hill Middle.  The key to making her dreams a reality was being noticed by the cutest eighth grade boy in school.
Desperate to fit in, Stacy and her best friend, Tomeka (who is well known), conspire to make Stacy&#39;s dream a reality.  Their weapon of choice is a Golden Girl perm hair kit.  However, to Stacy&#39;s surprise, an unexpected road block has halted her plans for a glamorous makeover.
This setback causes more agony than fame; spiraling Stacy&#39;s confidence to an all time low.  A continuous chain of unfortunate events forces Stacy to regret ever revealing her secret crush.  Her friendship with Tomeka is in limbo, a mysterious note may blow her cover, and to make matters worse, she is unprepared for an unanticipated class presentation.  
What appears to be shear tragedy leads Stacy to a completely new world and allows her to take an introspective journey of discovery." />
