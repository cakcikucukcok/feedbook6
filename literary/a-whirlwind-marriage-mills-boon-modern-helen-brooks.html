          &lt;strong&gt;Zeke Buchanan had swept Marianne off her feet, and their two-year marriage had been perfect - until recently.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Their physical passion was as strong as ever, but was Zeke starting to regret their impulsive wedding?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The beautiful Liliana was clearly interested in more than a business relationship with Zeke.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Was he tempted?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Marianne was determined to save her marriage and prove to her husband that their honeymoon wasn&#39;t over, it was only just beginning!&lt;/p&gt;
