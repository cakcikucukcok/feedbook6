  <title>Montpelier Parade - Karl Geary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;Charismatic Karl Geary is a talented writer to watch; translation rights for &lt;i&gt;Montpelier Parade&lt;/i&gt; have already been sold for 15 languages, and in the U.K., it is Harvill Secker’s lead title for 2017 after a 5-house auction.
&lt;li&gt;Geary, an Irish-born American, is well-connected in the New York arts/music scene and visits frequently; he co-founded music venue Sin-é, where performers including Jeff Buckley, Ben Folds, David Gray, and Sinead O’Connor played frequently, and he is co-owner of the Scratcher in NYC’s East Village. Geary is also an actor and screenwriter with connections in the film and music industries.
&lt;li&gt;The searing, intimate second-person narrative fits the novel perfectly; the style never feels gimmicky, and instead feels both cinematic and conversational, offering us intimate access to Sonny&#39;s thoughts.
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Montpelier Parade&lt;/i&gt; is a dark and atmospheric love story set against a realistic backdrop of working-class family life; the appeal of this novel is as present in the space between sentences as in the writing itself. Much of the genius comes from the words left unsaid by Sonny and his family, pulling the reader into an honest exploration of complex relationship dynamics and communication." />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Montpelier Parade - Karl Geary</i></b> | Montpelier Parade by Karl Geary is a beautiful and tender debut novel shortlisted for the Costa First Novel Award 2017. Montpelier Parade is set in Dublin in the 1980s, between the Georgian terraces of Monkstown and the rough, impoverished housing estate where the adolescent narrator, Sonny Knowles, lives.<br /><b><i>Montpelier Parade by Karl Geary - Goodreads</i></b> | MONTPELIER PARADE is one of those unputdownable reads, and from a brand new author, young Karl Geary, a Dublin-born NYC actor and entrepreneur. Saw the book advertised online, from Catapult, a small press. New author, new publisher (at least to me), new book. There is a NEW-ness to the novel, although it is an old story.<br /><b><i>Montpelier Parade: A Novel: Geary, Karl: 9781936787555 ...</i></b> | In Montpelier Parade, he delivers an unforgettable love story in writing that is often exceptional . . . Geary captures time and place startlingly well . . . Montpelier Parade is reminiscent of Barry Hines’ novel A Kestrel for a Knave — that 1960s classic of social realism — in its depiction of a youngster trapped by deprivation.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Montpelier Parade - Karl Geary</a> </h3></p><hr/>
