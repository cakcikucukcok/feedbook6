  <title>The Practical Navigator - Stephen Metcalfe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Michael Hodge has been many things in life. A surfer. A husband. A father. A son. A business owner. A lover. &lt;i&gt;Abandoned.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever  since Michael&#39;s wife, Anita, ran off leaving him to raise their child  on his own, he has been struggling to pick up the pieces. And after  seven years, he&#39;s finally starting to put his life back together. He has  given up his dream of surfing and now manages his own construction  business, he works hard to be the best father possible to his autistic  son, and he&#39;s falling for a new woman. But when Anita returns to town  unannounced wanting to be a part of their lives again, and his mother  begins showing early signs of Alzheimer&#39;s, Michael&#39;s carefully  reconstructed world begins to fall apart. Now, Michael must decide  whether or not to give Anita a second chance or to protect his son, and  himself, from being hurt yet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With pitch perfect emotion  and a beautiful portrayal of the relationship between a father and son,  Stephen Metcalfe has drawn a rich and layered portrait of what it means  to be a family and what it means to be truly loved.&lt;/p&gt;" />
