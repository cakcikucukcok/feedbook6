  <title>Project June Bug - Jackie Minniti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;With focus and characters as mainstream as &lt;i&gt;Main Street&lt;/i&gt;, this fine novel is far more a great read than message tale.&quot;-&lt;b&gt;Tom Corcoran&lt;/b&gt;, author of &lt;I&gt;Air Dance Iguana&lt;/I&gt;, &lt;I&gt;Jimmy Buffett-The Key West Years&lt;/I&gt;, and &lt;I&gt;Key West in Black and White&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Life is good for Jenna Bianchi. She&#39;s just started her second year of teaching English at Morrison High School, a job she loves. She has a pet parrot with attitude. And there&#39;s a handsome math teacher who wants to be more than just friends. But everything changes when a defiant, disruptive tenth grader walks into her classroom.&lt;/p&gt;
With a smart mouth and a swagger to match, Michael Tayler is a problem for Jenna from the very first day. His school record screams &lt;I&gt;troublemaker&lt;/I&gt;, and Jenna wonders if the new year is already doomed. But when she reads Michael&#39;s first poetry assignment, she recognizes it for what it truly is: a cry for help.&lt;/p&gt;
Michael&#39;s presence sets into motion a chain of events that turns Jenna&#39;s perfect life upside-down and threatens to destroy her career. Faced with a challenge unlike anything she&#39;s ever known, Jenna commits to doing what no one has done for Michael Tayler before.&lt;/p&gt;" />
