  <title>A Home of Her Own (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) - Brenda Novak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;
            &lt;em&gt;When Lucky Caldwell was ten, her mother, Red–the best-known hooker in Dundee, Idaho–married Morris Caldwell, a wealthy and much older man.&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It didn&#39;t last, of course, but Morris&#39;s kindness was the highlight of Lucky&#39;s life. Mike Hill, Morris&#39;s grandson, doesn&#39;t feel too well-disposed toward Red or her kids. He believes they alienated Morris from his family. Even Morris&#39;s Victorian mansion, on the property next to the Hill ranch, wasn&#39;t inherited by one of his grandchildren. Instead the house went to Lucky, who left it sitting empty for years.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now that Red and Morris are both dead, Lucky has finally come back to Dundee. She plans to restore the derelict place–and to look for her real father, who has to be one of three men named in her mother&#39;s diary. That means Mike has a new neighbor. One he doesn&#39;t want to like…&lt;/p&gt;
