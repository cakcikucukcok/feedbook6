  <title>The Book of V. - Anna Solomon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A GOOD MORNING AMERICA BOOK CLUB PICK&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;A BELLETRIST BOOK CLUB PICK&lt;/b&gt;     &lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For fans of &lt;i&gt;The Hours &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; Fates and Furies&lt;/i&gt;, a bold, kaleidoscopic novel intertwining the lives of three women across three centuries as their stories of sex, power, and desire finally converge in the present day.&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lily is a mother and a daughter. And a second wife. And a writer, maybe? Or she was going to be, before she had children. Now, in her rented Brooklyn apartment she&#39;s grappling with her sexual and intellectual desires, while also trying to manage her roles as a mother and a wife in 2016. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vivian Barr seems to be the perfect political wife, dedicated to helping her charismatic and ambitious husband find success in Watergate-era Washington D.C. But one night he demands a humiliating favor, and her refusal to obey changes the course of her life--along with the lives of others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Esther is a fiercely independent young woman in ancient Persia, where she and her uncle&#39;s tribe live a tenuous existence outside the palace walls. When an innocent mistake results in devastating consequences for her people, she is offered up as a sacrifice to please the King, in the hopes that she will save them all. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In Anna Solomon&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Book of V.&lt;/i&gt;, these three characters&#39; riveting stories overlap and ultimately collide, illuminating how women&#39;s lives have and have not changed over thousands of years.&lt;/p&gt;" />
