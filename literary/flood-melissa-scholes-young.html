      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winner of the Literary Fiction Category for the 2017 Best Book Award&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A sparkling debut set in Mark Twain&#39;s boyhood town, &lt;i&gt;Flood&lt;/i&gt; is a story of what it means to be lost . . . and found.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Laura  Brooks fled her hometown of Hannibal, Missouri, ten years ago after a  historic flood and personal heartbreak. Now she&#39;s returned unannounced,  and her family and friends don&#39;t know what to make of it. She says she&#39;s  just home for a brief visit and her high-school reunion, but she&#39;s  carrying too much luggage for that: literal and metaphorical. Soon Laura  is embroiled in small-town affairs--the contentious divorce of her  rowdy best friend Rose; the campaign of her twelve-year-old godson,  Bobby, to become the town&#39;s official Tom Sawyer; and the renewed  interest of the man Laura once thought she&#39;d marry, Sammy McGuire. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Leaving  town when she was eighteen had been Laura&#39;s only option. She feared a  stifling existence in a town ruled by its past, its mythological  devotion to Mark Twain, and the economic and racial divide that runs as  deep as the Mississippi River. She can&#39;t forget that fateful Fourth of  July when the levees broke or the decisions that still haunt her. Now as  the Mississippi rises again, a deep wound threatens to reopen, and  Laura must decide if running away once more might be the best way to  save herself." />
