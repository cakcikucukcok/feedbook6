  <title>Convenience Store Woman - Sayaka Murata, Ginny Tapley Takemori</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;Murata has been a huge runaway bestseller in Japan, one of the highest selling literary novels of recent years, selling 660,000 hardcovers to date. &lt;i&gt;Convenience Store Woman&lt;/i&gt; won Japan’s most prestigious literary prize, the Akutagawa Prize. Rights have been sold in nine territories so far; Grove conducted a four-way auction for UK &amp; Commonwealth rights, selling to Granta Books, the UK publisher of &lt;i&gt;The Vegetarian&lt;/i&gt;, which is a good comp title. There is already a lot of buzz behind this book and author.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;li&gt;Reminiscent of the work of Haruki Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto, &lt;i&gt;Convenience Store Woman&lt;/i&gt; follows a young woman who adores her dead-end job at a convenience store in Tokyo and doesn’t understand the concern of her friends and relatives who want her to settle down. &lt;i&gt;Convenience Store Woman&lt;/i&gt; is both wry social novel and sensitive portrait, a heartfelt and brilliantly written novel.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;li&gt;We hope to follow the trajectory of an author like Han Kang and think that this book has the potential to win a big readership as well as the literary clout to be awarded major international prizes.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;li&gt;Murata has a building international profile and was recently selected as one of &lt;i&gt;Freeman&lt;/i&gt;’s “The Future of New Writing” authors. Murata’s short fiction has been published by magazines including &lt;i&gt;Granta&lt;/i&gt;, who featured her in their Japan issue but this is her English-language debut and we hope for significant press and great bookseller support.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;li&gt;The author herself worked at a convenience store in Japan and despite her huge success as a writer still finds the time to do the occasional shift at her store. She is an ideal subject for journalist profiles.&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;li&gt;A Japanese film adaptation of the novel is underway and there has been interest in the book from American film studios." />
