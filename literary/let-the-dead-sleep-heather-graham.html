  <title>Let the Dead Sleep - Heather Graham</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;An object of desire? Or of fear?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It was stolen from a New Orleans grave—the centuries-old bust of an evil man, a demonic man. It’s an object desired by collectors and by those with wickedness in their hearts. One day, its current owner shows up at Danni Cafferty’s antiques shop on Royal Street, the shop she inherited from her father.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But before Danni can buy the statue, it disappears, the owner is found dead…and Danni discovers that she’s inherited much more than she realized. In the store is a book filled with secret writing: instructions for defeating evil entities. She’d dismissed it as a curiosity…until the arrival of this statue, with its long history of evil and even longer trail of death.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Michael Quinn, former cop and now private investigator, is a man with an unusual past. He believes that doing the right thing isn’t a job — it’s a way of life. And the right thing to do is find and destroy this object weighted with malevolent powers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;He and Danni are drawn together in their search for the missing statue, following it through sultry New Orleans nights to hidden places in the French Quarter and secret ceremonies on abandoned plantations. Cafferty and Quinn already know that trust in others can be misplaced, that love can be temporary.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And yet their connection is primal. Mesmerizing. They also know that their story won’t end when this case is closed and the dead rest in peace once again.&lt;/p&gt;
