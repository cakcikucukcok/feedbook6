  <title>The White Horse - Irene Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Combining literary fiction and memoir The White Horse provides a sensitive, humorous and endearing account of a familys struggle to survive living with an alcoholic. Through the lens of a wife and mother, the story evokes the shifting choices confronting families and the social issues they face. It is more than a novel; it is also a social history. 
The story transcends three continents and forty years. The highs and lows, the laughs and smiles all are here to share. Above all else runs the depth of love that permeates the apparent normalcy of family life on the surface, and the trauma of living in a dysfunctional situation. 
It is challenging and thought-provoking; although this is subtly assumed through the typical daily activities of the family. 
Using the metaphor of riding a carousel the story unfolds to reveal the different approaches the family takes to cope with the increasing trials posed by living with an alcoholic husband and father, John. Each ride portrays the emotions and feelings that are encountered during this journey, providing an insight into how the family survives and emerges stronger for the challenge. 
On the last visit to the carousel the final white horse looms  who will be riding it and where is it heading?B
Joan from Al-Anon says: 
&quot;The White Horse is an inspirational book focusing on one of the leading addictions today: alcoholism. The plot is fresh and different&quot;. 
Frank from AA says: 
&quot;It&#39;s a fantastic book. It&#39;s funny in places emotional, thoughtful I am now re-thinking my own life&quot;.
