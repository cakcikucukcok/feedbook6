  <title>The American - Martin Booth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The locals in the southern Italian town where he lives call him Signor Farfalla--Mr. Butterfly: for he is a discreet gentleman who paints rare butterflies. His life is inconspicuous--mornings spent brushing at a canvas, afternoons idling in the cafes, and evening talks with his friend the town priest over a glass of brandy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet there are other sides to this gentleman&#39;s life: Clara: the young student who moonlights in the town bordello. And another woman who arrives with $100,000 and a commission, but not for a painting of butterflies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this assignment returns the dark fear that has dogged Signor Farfalla&#39;s mysterious life. Almost instantly, he senses a deadly circle closing in on him, one which he may or may not elude. Part thriller, part character study, part drama of deceit and self-betrayal, &lt;i&gt;The American&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;A Very Private Gentleman)&lt;/i&gt; shows Martin Booth at the very height of his powers.&lt;/p&gt;" />
