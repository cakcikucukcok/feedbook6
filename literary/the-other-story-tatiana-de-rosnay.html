  <title>The Other Story - Tatiana de Rosnay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A New York Times best seller!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and international best-selling author Tatiana de Rosnay comes &lt;i&gt;The Other Story&lt;/i&gt;, &quot;[a] brilliant pager-turner&quot;(&lt;i&gt;BookPage&lt;/i&gt;), layered and beautifully written, that is a reflection on identity, the process of being a writer and the repercussions of generations-old decisions as they echo into the present and shape the future.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vacationing at a luxurious Tuscan island resort, Nicolas Duhamel is hopeful that the ghosts of his past have finally been put to rest... Now a bestselling author, when he was twenty-four years old, he stumbled upon a troubling secret about his family-a secret that was carefully concealed. In shock, Nicolas embarked on a journey to uncover the truth that took him from the Basque coast to St. Petersburg-but the answers wouldn&#39;t come easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the process of digging into his past, something else happened. Nicolas began writing a novel that was met with phenomenal success, skyrocketing him to literary fame whether he was ready for it or not - and convincing him that he had put his family&#39;s history firmly behind him. But now, years later, Nicolas must reexamine everything he thought he knew, as he learns that, however deeply buried, the secrets of the past always find a way out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;The tension of Nicholas&#39;s unsustainable half-truths and the gradual parceling out of his father&#39;s secrets will keep readers in de Rosnay&#39;s thrall, hoping redemption will come. Readers in real life should anticipate de Rosnay&#39;s latest with all the fervor Nicholas&#39;s fans show in awaiting his.&quot;-&lt;i&gt;Shelf Awareness&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;de Rosnay&#39;s fans...will not be disappointed.&quot;-&lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
