  <title>What His Money Can&#39;t Hide (Mills &amp; Boon Modern) - Maggie Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The man with the golden touch&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Drake Ashton has defied his under-privileged, unloved upbringing to become a world-famous architect. With a house in Mayfair and a platinum card to buy anything he wants, his past is well and truly behind him. Until he’s called back home to revitalise his family’s ailing fortunes…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Layla Jerome has been duped by the trappings of wealth before – a man with money isn’t enough to impress her! So when Drake strides into her small town like Midas himself she’s determined not to be branded by his touch. But when she’s faced with the sheer force of Drake, that’s more easily said than done…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;‘I love reading Maggie Cox. Always oozing with emotion and sexual tension!’ – &lt;em&gt;Victoria, Retired, Belfast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
