  <title>Rooted - Idabel Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Working his lifetime to bury a shameful past and restore the family name, Grover McQuiston rules the town of Moonsock, Tennessee and his family with an iron fist. Or he did, until his eerily skittish tomboy granddaughter, Sarah Jane, scandalizes the entire town. Before Grover can force Sarah Jane to marry, blue-haired, strung-out punk Slade Mortimer crash lands in Moonsock in a stolen car, claiming to be Grover&amp;#39;s long-lost grandson and seeking an inheritance. When Slade&amp;rsquo;s presence resurrects questions regarding his mother&amp;rsquo;s mysterious disappearance years before, it seems things couldn&amp;rsquo;t get any worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Grover&amp;rsquo;s wife, Eleanor, dies. And in those flat delta fields, Grover learns nothing, absolutely nothing stays buried forever. As the McQuistons prepare for a most unusual funeral, they must account for their past sins: Grover, whose darkest secrets are about to become unearthed. Reclusive Sarah Jane, who hides deep literary talents and deeper scars. And Slade, running from the memory of his dead girlfriend and her vengeful father, seeking the legacy he never knew he possessed&amp;mdash;and discovering the family he never knew he needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeping from the grime of the 70&amp;rsquo;s New York City punk scene to the truck-scarred roads of rural Tennessee, this evocative, wry, and beautifully-written novel captures the grit of Southern storytelling at its finest while also launching a fresh, unique new voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;?????&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
