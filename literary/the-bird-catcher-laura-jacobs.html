  <title>The Bird Catcher - Laura Jacobs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Margret Snow is the quintessential New York woman.  She dresses the windows of Saks Fifth Avenue by day and mingles in the downtown art world by night, always searching for her niche in a city intent on capturing The Next Big Thing as it flies into view.  Married to Charles, a professor at Columbia, and living on the Upper West Side, the backdrop to Margret&#39;s life is made up of the poetic rhythms and colors of the Manhattan day: slow-running buses, the gray morning light striking the Hudson, the winter landscape of Riverside Park, the endless round of gallery openings, cocktail parties and grand dinners in the palatial apartments on Manhattan&#39;s upper east side.  Against this metropolitan whirl, Margret and Charles pursue a lifelong hobby of bird watching, a passion for which was kindled by her grandfather during long-past summers near the shore in Gloucester, Massachusetts. As they shuttle between their Manhattan apartment, birding in the city&#39;s parks, and weekends out of town in their house near Cape May, a violent upheaval pushes Margret beyond the boundaries of her hobby.  Overnight, she becomes an art world sensation and just as suddenly has fame ripped from her.   As Laura Jacobs proved in her first novel, &quot;Women About Town&quot;, she understands the natural habitat of the New York Woman in all its complexity.  In The Bird Catcher, her second, she moves deeper into that territory with the story of a remarkable woman who is as rare and special as the birds that fill the skies above her.&lt;/p&gt;" />
