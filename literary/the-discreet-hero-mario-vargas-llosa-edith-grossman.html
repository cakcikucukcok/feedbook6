  <title>The Discreet Hero - Mario Vargas Llosa, Edith Grossman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The latest masterpiece&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;--perceptive, funny, insightful, affecting&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;--from the Nobel Prize-winning author&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa&#39;s newest novel, &lt;i&gt;The Discreet Hero&lt;/i&gt;, follows two fascinating characters whose lives are destined to intersect: neat, endearing Felícito Yanaqué, a small businessman in Piura, Peru, who finds himself the victim of blackmail; and Ismael Carrera, a successful owner of an insurance company in Lima, who cooks up a plan to avenge himself against the two lazy sons who want him dead.&lt;br&gt;     Felícito and Ismael are, each in his own way, quiet, discreet rebels: honorable men trying to seize control of their destinies in a social and political climate where all can seem set in stone, predetermined. They are hardly vigilantes, but each is determined to live according to his own personal ideals and desires--which means forcibly rising above the pettiness of their surroundings. &lt;i&gt;The Discreet Hero&lt;/i&gt; is also a chance to revisit some of our favorite players from previous Vargas Llosa novels: Sergeant Lituma, Don Rigoberto, Doña Lucrecia, and Fonchito are all here in a prosperous Peru. Vargas Llosa sketches Piura and Lima vividly--and the cities become not merely physical spaces but realms of the imagination populated by his vivid characters.&lt;br&gt;     A novel whose humor and pathos shine through in Edith Grossman&#39;s masterly translation, &lt;i&gt;The Discreet Hero&lt;/i&gt; is another remarkable achievement from the finest Latin American novelist at work today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
