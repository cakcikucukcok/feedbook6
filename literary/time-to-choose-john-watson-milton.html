  <title>Time to Choose - John Watson Milton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, the abortion issue became the most important blood test for political candidates.  Those who didn&#39;t follow the party line on this issue had little or no chance to win their party&#39;s endorsement.  Anyone seeking middle ground was caught in the crossfire.  
Time to Choose is a novel of romance in the middle of the crossfire.  A story about the many choices we make  personal and professional, why and how we make them, and the consequences of those choices.  
Former state senator Michael Burke returns to the State Capitol after a ten year absence, to attend the funeral of a former colleague and close friend.  The funeral evokes memories of bittersweet years in politics.  Exhilarating victories, and crushing losses.  He&#39;s reminded that he left the turbulent political arena for a more stable and balanced life, one with time and energy for his children.  But after meeting an intriguing new candidate for the Senate, Dr. Patricia Culligan, he breaks a vow: never to go back to politics. 
Michael Burke&#39;s return to the battleground forces him to confront his past, and understand how his choices caused harm to himself and others.  And how accepting this can be a prelude to moving on with his life." />
