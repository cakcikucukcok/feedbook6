  <title>What Was Lost - Catherine O&#39;Flynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A tender and sharply observant debut novel about a missing young girl--winner of the Costa First Novel Award and long-listed for the Booker Prize, the Orange Prize, and &lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt; First Book Award&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, Kate Meaney--&quot;Top Secret&quot; notebook and toy monkey in tow--is hard at work as a junior detective. Busy trailing &quot;suspects&quot; and carefully observing everything around her at the newly opened Green Oaks shopping mall, she forms an unlikely friendship with Adrian, the son of a local shopkeeper. But when this curious, independent-spirited young girl disappears, Adrian falls under suspicion and is hounded out of his home by the press. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2003, Adrian&#39;s sister Lisa--stuck in a dead-end relationship--is working as a manager at Your Music, a discount record store. Every day she tears her hair out at the outrageous behavior of her customers and colleagues. But along with a security guard, Kurt, she becomes entranced by the little girl glimpsed on the mall&#39;s surveillance cameras. As their after-hours friendship intensifies, Lisa and Kurt investigate how these sightings might be connected to the unsettling history of Green Oaks itself. Written with warmth and wit, &lt;i&gt;What Was Lost&lt;/i&gt; is a haunting debut from an incredible new talent.&lt;/p&gt;" />
