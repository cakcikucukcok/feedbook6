  <title>Shoot Me, I´m Already Dead - Julia Navarro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;The gripping story of two families struggling to overcome their own destinies. &lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;A mosaic of treachery and revenge, of possible and impossible loves,  and of the great adventure that is living and surviving in a land marked by intolerance and outrage.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;Marian Miller, an NGO aid worker, is asked to write a report on illegal  Jewish settlements on Palestinian territories. In order to do so, she  wants to make sure she understands both sides of the story. Marian  arranges a meeting in Israel with Ezekiel Zucker, an elderly man who,  like many others, has a lot to tell and also, a secret to hide. Ezekiel  will narrate his story as if it were a massive jigsaw puzzle with many  complex pieces and Marian will tell him the version she&#39;s familiar with: the Arab one.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;At the twilight of the 19th century, the Zuckers are banned from their  homeland of Russia because they are Jewish. After undergoing unspeakable  horrors and injustices under the tsar&#39;s rule, they set out for the  Promised Land and buy land owned by the Ziads, an Arab family headed by  a man named Ahmed. The two men, Ahmed Ziad and Samuel Zucker, will  establish a strong bond, a friendship that can overcome religious and  political differences and that will continue on for generations.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;P&gt;This riveting family saga that culminates in 1948 is not only Julia  Navarro&#39;s best and most ambitious novel yet, it&#39;s a tale filled with  real people taking responsibility for their own destinies by following  their dreams and fighting for their lives. An unforgettable novel that,  like all of history&#39;s greatest books, conceals many novels within.&lt;/P&gt;" />
