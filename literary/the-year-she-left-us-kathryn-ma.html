  <title>The Year She Left Us - Kathryn Ma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the winner of the 2009 Iowa Short Fiction Prize&amp;#8212;comes the extraordinary, unexpected debut tale of three generations of Chinese-American women in a San Francisco family who must confront their past and carve out a future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kong women are in crisis. A disastrous trip to visit her &quot;home&quot; orphanage in China has plunged eighteen-year-old Ari into a self-destructive spiral. Her adoptive mother, Charlie, a lawyer with a great heart, is desperate to keep her daughter safe. Meanwhile, Charlie must endure the prickly scrutiny of her beautiful, Bryn Mawr educated mother, Gran&amp;#8212;who, as the daughter of a cultured Chinese doctor, came to America to survive Mao&#39;s Revolution&amp;#8212;and her sister, Les, a brilliant judge with a penchant to rule over everyone&#39;s lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they cope with Ari&#39;s journey of discovery and its aftermath, the Kong women will come face to face with the truths of their lives&amp;#8212;four powerful intertwining stories of accomplishment, tenacity, secrets, loneliness, and love. Beautifully illuminating the bonds of family and blood, &lt;em&gt;The Year She Left Us&lt;/em&gt; explores the promise and pain of adoption, the price of assimilation and achievement, the debt we owe to others, and what we owe ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;" />
