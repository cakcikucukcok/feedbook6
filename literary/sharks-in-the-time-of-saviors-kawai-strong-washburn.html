When a shiver of sharks appears in the water, everyone fears for the worst. But instead, Noa is gingerly delivered to his mother in the jaws of a shark, marking his story as the stuff of legends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nainoa&#39;s family, struggling amidst the collapse of the sugarcane industry, hails his rescue as a sign of favor from ancient Hawaiian gods--a belief that appears validated after he exhibits puzzling new abilities. But as time passes, this supposed divine favor begins to drive the family apart: Nainoa, working now as a paramedic on the streets of Portland, struggles to fathom the full measure of his expanding abilities; further north in Washington, his older brother Dean hurtles into the world of elite college athletics, obsessed with wealth and fame; while in California, risk-obsessed younger sister Kaui navigates an unforgiving academic workload in an attempt to forge her independence from the family&#39;s legacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When supernatural events revisit the Flores family in Hawai&#39;i--with tragic consequences--they are all forced to reckon with the bonds of family, the meaning of heritage, and the cost of survival.&lt;/p&gt;" />
