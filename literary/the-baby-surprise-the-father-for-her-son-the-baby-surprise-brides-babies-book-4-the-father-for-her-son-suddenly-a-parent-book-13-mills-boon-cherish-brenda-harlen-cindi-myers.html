        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Paige was married to her job – until she became guardian to a baby. Then Zach Crawford appeared on Paige’s doorstep and her life really went topsy turvy. Because the sexy pilot was determined to win custody of his little girl…no matter the sparks that flew every time he and Paige were together!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The Father for Her Son&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After seven years away, Troy Denton is back. How can Marlee deny him knowing his son, Greg? Every time she watches Troy with Greg the icy place in her heart melts a little. Can she believe Troy’s vow he’s here for good?&lt;/p&gt;
