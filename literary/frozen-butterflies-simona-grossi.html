  <title>Frozen Butterflies - Simona Grossi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Susan Blanc, the protagonist and narrative voice, teaches psychology at a university in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She lives alone and suffers from insomnia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night, at a nightclub, she meets Nick, a blogger who seemed to be &amp;ldquo;consumed by something, someone, or himself.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they meet again the next day, Nick takes her to his apartment, and while browsing through Nick&amp;rsquo;s books looking for ideas for a story to post on Nick&amp;rsquo;s blog, Susan finds a &amp;ldquo;consumed notebook with a light blue cover.&amp;rdquo; Nick explains that it&amp;rsquo;s a journal someone lost on a bus and that the writing and the drawings it contains made him want to keep it and try to return it to its owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author is a graphic novelist, his name is Andrew, but that&amp;rsquo;s all he knows about him. After leafing through its pages, Susan convinces Nick to post excerpts of the journal on Nick&amp;rsquo;s blog. She believes the journal will resonate with the readers, and that the readers might help them find the unknown artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they read and write, search and explore, Nick and Susan&amp;#39;s stories melt with the artist&amp;#39;s story, in a cocktail of passion, sex, lies, and self-discovery.&lt;/p&gt;" />
