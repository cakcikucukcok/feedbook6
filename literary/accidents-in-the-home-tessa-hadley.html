  <title>Accidents in the Home - Tessa Hadley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A powerful literary debut chronicling a year in the life of one thoroughly modern family&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clare Verey, a twenty-nine-year-old mother of three, bakes her own bread and grinds her own spices. She has a comfortable home in the suburbs and a devoted husband. Why is it, then, that when her best friend&#39;s lover appears in her life he has the power to invert her world? Why is the desire for more never satisfied?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So begins &lt;i&gt;Accidents in the Home&lt;/i&gt;, a novel that exposes the emotional underbelly of a modern-day family. Clare&#39;s narrative is deftly intertwined with the stories of her extended family: her mother, Marian, the clever daughter of a Dostoevsky scholar whose husband leaves her for a beautiful young art student; Clare&#39;s half brother, Toby, a dreamy boy who prefers to view life through the lens of a camera; her troubled younger half sister, Tamsin, who develops an apparatus of taboos and rituals to restore order to her chaotic past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the world Tessa Hadley has created, family is no longer a steady foundation but a complex web of marriages, divorces, half siblings, and stepchildren that expands with every new connection and betrayal. &lt;i&gt;Accidents in the Home&lt;/i&gt; offers a startling, intimate portrait of family life in our time.&lt;/p&gt;" />
