          &lt;strong&gt;Forbidden to Love&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Doomed to Fail Savannah Colbert has never known why she’s so hated by the kids of the Clann. Nor can she deny her instinct to get close to Clann golden boy Tristan Coleman. Especially when she recovers from a strange illness and the attraction becomes nearly irresistible. It’s as if he’s a magnet, pulling her gaze, her thoughts, even her dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her family has warned her to have nothing to do with him, or any members of the Clann. But when Tristan is suddenly everywhere she goes, Savannah fears she’s destined to fail. For years, Tristan has been forbidden to even speak to Savannah Colbert.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Then Savannah disappears from school for a week and comes back. . . different, and suddenly he can’t stay away. Boys seem intoxicated just from looking at her. His own family becomes stricter than ever. And Tristan has to fight his own urge to protect her, to be near her no matter the consequences. . . .&lt;/p&gt;
