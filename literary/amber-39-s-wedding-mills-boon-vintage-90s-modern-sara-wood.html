  <title>Amber&#39;s Wedding (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage 90s Modern) - Sara Wood</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A wedding to remember!&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The bride was resplendent, the groom was handsome, the location was grand and the cream of society was there. It was a glorious affair - with just a few small hitches. The groom was behaving both jealously and possessively, yet strangely Jake and Amber were friends but not lovers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Amber, however, was pregnant - with another man&#39;s child. All in all it wasn&#39;t your average wedding, and the best was yet to come: Jake was about to reveal to Amber a secret about her past, her family. It was a revelation that would change her life and uncover Jake&#39;s true motives for marrying her. It was all happening at Amber&#39;s wedding.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Three women are looking for their family - what they truly seek is love. Things are rarely as they seem, in Sara Wood&#39;s intriguing family trilogy.&lt;/em&gt;
