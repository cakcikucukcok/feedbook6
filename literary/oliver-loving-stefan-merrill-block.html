  <title>Oliver Loving - Stefan Merrill Block</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A dazzling novel about love, loss, and the mysteries of the mind.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;-- David Ebershoff, Bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;The Danish Girl&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The 19th Wife&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;A breathtaking tale of tragedy and redemption... A triumph&quot; --&lt;i&gt; People&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A family in crisis, a town torn apart, and the boy who holds the secret has been cocooned in a coma for ten years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One warm, West Texas November night, a shy boy named Oliver Loving joins his classmates at Bliss County Day School&#39;s annual dance, hoping for a glimpse of the object of his unrequited affections, an enigmatic Junior named Rebekkah Sterling. But as the music plays, a troubled young man sneaks in through the school&#39;s back door. The dire choices this man makes that evening --and the unspoken story he carries-- will tear the town of Bliss, Texas apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly ten years later, Oliver Loving still lies wordless and paralyzed at Crockett State Assisted Care Facility, the fate of his mind unclear. Orbiting the stillpoint of Oliver&#39;s hospital bed is a family transformed: Oliver&#39;s mother, Eve, who keeps desperate vigil; Oliver&#39;s brother, Charlie, who has fled for New York City only to discover he cannot escape the gravity of his shattered family; Oliver&#39;s father, Jed, who tries to erase his memories with bourbon. And then there is Rebekkah Sterling, Oliver&#39;s teenage love, who left Texas long ago and still refuses to speak about her own part in that tragic night. When a new medical test promises a key to unlock Oliver&#39;s trapped mind, the town&#39;s unanswered questions resurface with new urgency, as Oliver&#39;s doctors and his family fight for a way for Oliver to finally communicate-- and so also to tell the truth of what really happened that fateful night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A moving meditation on the transformative power of grief and love, a slyly affectionate look at the idiosyncrasies of family, and an emotionally-charged page-turner, Stefan Merill Block&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Oliver Loving&lt;/i&gt; is an extraordinarily original novel that ventures into the unknowable and returns with the most fundamental truths.&lt;/p&gt;" />
