  <title>The Reeducation of Cherry Truong - Aimee Phan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Cherry Truong&#39;s parents have exiled her wayward older brother from their Southern California home, sending him to Vietnam to live with distant relatives.  Determined to bring him back, twenty-one-year-old Cherry travels to their homeland and finds herself on a journey to uncover her family&#39;s decades-old secrets--hidden loves, desperate choices, and lives ripped apart by the march of war and currents of history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Reeducation of Cherry Truong&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of two fierce and unforgettable families, the Truongs and the Vos: their harrowing escape from Vietnam after the war, the betrayal that divided them, and the stubborn memories that continue to bind them years later, even as they come to terms with their hidden sacrifices and bitter mistakes. Kim-Ly, Cherry&#39;s grandmother, once wealthy and powerful in Vietnam, now struggles to survive in Little Saigon, California without English or a driver&#39;s license. Cherry&#39;s other grandmother Hoa, whose domineering husband has developed dementia, discovers a cache of letters from a woman she thought had been left behind. As Cherry pieces their stories together, she uncovers the burden of her family&#39;s love and the consequences of their choices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set in Vietnam, France, and the United States, Aimee Phan&#39;s sweeping debut novel reveals a family still yearning for reconciliation, redemption, and a place to call home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
