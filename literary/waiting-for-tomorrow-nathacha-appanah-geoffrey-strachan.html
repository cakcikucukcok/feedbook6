  <title>Waiting for Tomorrow - Nathacha Appanah, Geoffrey Strachan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A powerful examination of the artistic impulse, cultural identity, and family bonds&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anita is waiting for Adam to be released from prison. They met twenty  years ago at a New Year&#39;s Eve party in Paris, a city where they both  felt out of place--he as a recent arrival from the provinces, and she as  an immigrant from the island of Mauritius. They quickly fell in love,  married, and moved to a village in southwestern France, to live on the shores of the Atlantic with their little girl, Laura.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In order  to earn a living, Adam has left behind his love of painting to become an  architect, and Anita has turned her desire to write into a job  freelancing for a local newspaper. Over time, the monotony of daily life  begins to erode the bonds of their marriage. The arrival of Adèle, an  undocumented immigrant from Mauritius whom they hire to care for Laura,  sparks artistic inspiration for both Adam and Anita, as well as a  renewed energy in their relationship. But this harmony proves to be  short-lived, brought down by their separate transgressions of Adèle&#39;s  privacy and a subsequently tragic turn of events.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the careful observation, vivid description, and emotional resonance that are the hallmarks of her previous novel, &lt;i&gt;The Last Brother&lt;/i&gt;, in &lt;i&gt;Waiting for Tomorrow &lt;/i&gt;Nathacha  Appanah investigates the life of the artist, the question of cultural  differences within a marriage, and the creation and the destruction of a  family.&lt;/p&gt;" />
