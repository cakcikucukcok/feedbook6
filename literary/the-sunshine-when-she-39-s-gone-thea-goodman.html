  <title>The Sunshine When She&#39;s Gone - Thea Goodman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A fresh, funny, and wisely observed debut novel about marriage-about the love, longing and ambivalence exposed when a husband takes the baby on a highly unusual outing&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Veronica Reed wakes up one frigid January morning, two things are &quot;off&quot;-first of all, she has had a good night&#39;s sleep, which hasn&#39;t happened in months, and second, both her husband and her baby are gone. Grateful for the much-needed rest, Veronica doesn&#39;t, at first, seriously question her husband&#39;s trip out to breakfast with baby Clara. Little does she know, her spouse has fled lower Manhattan, with Clara, for some R&amp;R in the Caribbean. &lt;br&gt;Told through alternating points of view, &lt;i&gt;The Sunshine When She&#39;s Gone&lt;/i&gt; explores the life-changing impact of parenthood on a couple as individuals and as partners. Thea Goodman brings us into intimacies made tense by sleep-deprivation and to losses and gains made more real by acknowledging them. Here is the story of a couple pushed to the edge and a desperate father&#39;s attempt give them both space to breathe.&lt;/p&gt;" />
