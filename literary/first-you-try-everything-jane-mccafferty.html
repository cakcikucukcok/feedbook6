  <title>First You Try Everything - Jane McCafferty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An engrossing tale of a marriage that&amp;#8217;s falling apart and a wife who will stop at nothing to keep it together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From their early days in college, Evvie and Ben were drawn to each other by feelings of isolation stemming from their wounded childhoods, passionate idealism, and zeal for music. Sheltered by their love, they weathered the challenges and trials of the imperfect world around them. But as the years passed, they grew apart. Now Ben has his sights set on a completely different kind of future&amp;#8212;alone, or with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Convinced that Ben cannot live without her, Evvie begins to unravel, as she obsessively devises ways to reclaim the love that she cannot let go of. She gambles on a spectacularly dangerous scheme, one that may ultimately have devastating consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane McCafferty has written a highly original, utterly beguiling, and emotionally satisfying novel about marriage. Told from alternating viewpoints, this gripping, psychologically astute, and madcap novel illuminates the power of love to define and transform our lives, for better or for worse. &lt;/p&gt;" />
