  <title>@Expectations - Kit Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;@expectations&lt;/i&gt; is a fabulous work of women&#39;s fiction by a writer who has made a career of delving deep into women&#39;s hearts and finding the truth of their feelings and their lives. Reed&#39;s fiction has always examined the female and familial conditions with a sharp eye, a truthful insight, and a unique style that leaves her readers breathless and wanting more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jenny is living a typical suburban life, one she&#39;s no longer sure she really wants and doesn&#39;t know how to change. When she stumbles upon an online community where people create their own lives through words, she dives in headfirst, eager for something new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But soon Jenny becomes so far removed from her life that she can no longer even see the line between reality and fantasy; she&#39;s even got an online lover who insists that he will leave his own family, take her away from it all, and make their virtual life a reality. Eventually Jenny will have to make a choice: return to her husband, her children, her home, her &quot;real life&quot;--or escape into the arms of a fantasy world that may never become truly real. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
