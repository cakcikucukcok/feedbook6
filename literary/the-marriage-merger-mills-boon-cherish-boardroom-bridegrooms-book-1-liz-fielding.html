            &lt;em&gt;Flora Claibourne had arranged a business trip specifically to avoid having to work with handsome Bram Farraday Gifford. Only, her plan had backfired; he&#39;d decided to come with her!&lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Instead of nine to five, now she was forced to be with this powerfully attractive man constantly - on a romantic tropical island. She craved his touch, his kiss, but the barriers she&#39;d erected around herself were too strong, too high.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She wouldn&#39;t let anyone near - and Bram was intrigued…and willing to accept the challenge to find out why….&lt;/p&gt;
