  <title>Seahorse: A Novel - Janice Pariat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Nem was not like his college classmates. Instead of crowding around a TV set, Nem opted for lonely walks where he could indulge his passion for photography, until the night he saw Nicholas, a young professor from London, with another male student. The affair is passionate and brief. When Nicholas returns to London, Nem must move on. He graduates and soon finds success as a critic in Mumbai&amp;#8217;s burgeoning art world. Then comes an invitation to speak to artists in London, and the past is suddenly resurrected. As London&#39;s cosmopolitan art scene envelops Nem, he is haunted by the possibilities of a life with Nicholas. But Nicholas eludes Nem, avoiding a reunion with his old student, but leaving clues that lead to someone else: Myra, a woman Nem thought was Nicholas&#39;s sister. Brought together by their love for Nicholas, Nem and Myra embark on a surprising friendship.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Janice Pariat explores the concept of emotional memory with the inquisitive mind of a scientist and the prowess of a poet. Rich, immersive prose drives a story with international scope, one that seeks answers to the age-old mystery of what binds us to others, and how we can ever let them go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
