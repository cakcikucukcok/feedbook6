  <title>To Me You Seem Giant - Greg Rhyno</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 1994 and Pete Curtis can&#39;t wait to get out of Thunder Bay, Ontario. Already, he&#39;s playing drums in a band whose songs belong on mix-tapes everywhere. Even though his new girlfriend seems underwhelmed, he knows it&#39;s just a matter of time before he and his pals break big.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten years later, Pete is stuck teaching high school in the hometown he longed to escape, while his former best friend and bandmate is a bona fide rock star.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his debut novel, with its compelling hook and realistically flawed characters, Greg Rhyno remembers the time signatures of mid-nineties. Told in two alternating decades, &lt;i&gt;To Me You Seem Giant&lt;/i&gt; is a raucous and evocative story about the difficulties of living in the present when you can&#39;t escape your past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Praise for &lt;i&gt;To Me You Seem Giant&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;A brooding tenor - combined with a lifelong love for music that manifests itself in new ways as he ages - lends Pete&#39;s character a believable continuity.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Becky Robertson, &lt;i&gt;Quill &amp; Quire&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;To Me You Seem Giant&lt;/i&gt; is ultimately a touching and hopeful reminder of the need to confront the demons of your past in order to move on.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Alexander Kosoris, &lt;i&gt;The Walleye&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Underneath the layers of rock and roll is a compelling tale of lost loves, backstabbing bandmates and wondering where it all went wrong.&quot;&lt;br&gt;~ Steven Sandor, &lt;i&gt;Avenue Edmonton&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
