  <title>The Clay Girl - Heather Tucker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A stunning and lyrical debut novel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vincent Appleton smiles at his daughters, raises a gun, and blows off his head. For the Appleton sisters, life had unravelled many times before. This time it explodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eight-year-old Hariet, known to all as Ari, is dispatched to Cape Breton and her Aunt Mary, who is purported to eat little girls. But Mary and her partner, Nia, offer an unexpected refuge to Ari and her steadfast companion, Jasper, an imaginary seahorse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet the respite does not last, and Ari is torn from her aunts and forced back to her twisted mother and fractured sisters. Her new stepfather, Len, and his family offer hope, but as Ari grows to adore them, she’s severed violently from them too, when her mother moves in with the brutal Dick Irwin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the sexual revolution and drug culture of the 1960s, Ari struggles with her father’s legacy and her mother’s addictions, testing limits with substances that numb and men who show her kindness. Ari spins through a chaotic decade of loss and love, the devilish and divine, with wit, tenacity, and the astonishing balance unique to seahorses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Clay Girl&lt;/i&gt; is a beautiful tour de force about a child sculpted by kindness, cruelty, and the extraordinary power of imagination, and her families — the one she’s born in to and the one she creates.&lt;/p&gt;" />
