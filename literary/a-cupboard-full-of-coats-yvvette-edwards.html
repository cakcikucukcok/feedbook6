      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;[A] gorgeously lyrical debut novel&amp;#8230;.Engrossing and human to the core, Edwards&amp;#8217;s novel wrings the heart in the most tender of ways.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/em&gt; (starred review)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The novel is high drama, full of breathtaking tension, and, at times, brought to mind the works of Arthur Miller and August Wilson, both of whom knew a thing or two about secrets spilled across a kitchen table.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8212;Attica Locke, author of &lt;em&gt;Black Water Rising&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon the name on every fiction lover&amp;#8217;s lips will be Yvvette Edwards, thanks to her extraordinary debut novel, &lt;em&gt;A Cupboard Full of Coats&lt;/em&gt;. Longlisted for the Man Booker Prize, one of Great Britain&amp;#8217;s most prestigious literary awards, and named one of &lt;em&gt;Kirkus Review&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8217;s Best Books of the Year, Edwards&amp;#8217;s powerful first novel is at once a poignant family drama and a gripping mystery&amp;#8212;page-turning literature with an exhilarating infusion of noir. It is the story of Jinx, who believes she played a pivotal role in her mother&amp;#8217;s murder, until an old acquaintance appears at her door with seductive air, a long, strange story, and, quite possibly, the bitter truth. A truly stunning work of contemporary literary fiction that packs an emotional punch and keeps readers guessing to the end, &lt;em&gt;A Cupboard Full of Coats&lt;/em&gt; is already being compared by critics to the novels of the master, Ruth Rendell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
