  <title>Before I Burn - Gaute Heivoll, Don Bartlett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An international literary sensation about an arsonist on the loose in rural Norway and the young man haunted by the story&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1970s Norway, an arsonist targets a small town for one long, terrifying month. One by one, buildings go up in flames. Suspicion spreads among the neighbors as they wonder if one of their own is responsible. But as the heat and panic rise, new life finds a way to emerge. Amid the chaos, only a day before the last house is set afire, the community comes together for the christening of a young boy named Gaute Heivoll. As he grows up, stories about the time of fear and fire become deeply engrained in his young mind until, as an adult, he begins to retell the story. At the novel&#39;s apex the lives of Heivoll&#39;s friends and neighbors mix with his own life, and the identity of the arsonist and his motivations are slowly revealed. Based on the true account of Norway&#39;s most dramatic arson case, &lt;i&gt;Before I Burn&lt;/i&gt; is a powerful, gripping breakout novel from an exceptionally talented author.&lt;/p&gt;" />
