  <title>Triple Time (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) (The Art of Seduction, Book 2) - Regina Kyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;How to unravel your straightlaced lover…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Gabe Nelson would be a great district attorney, but his public image is too boring to get voters&#39; attention. Tattoo artist Devin Padilla can help him show off his fun, sexy side, but she needs something in return–his legal expertise to track down her missing brother. She&#39;s not Gabe&#39;s type, but they can&#39;t keep their hands off each other, whether it&#39;s good for his image or not.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;At first, Devin thinks she got the easy end of the bargain. Gabe&#39;s the sexiest stuffed shirt in Manhattan, and his kisses practically set her on fire. But every deal has its fine print. As their relationship goes from business to pleasure, Devin realizes this one won&#39;t cost her soul…it&#39;ll just steal her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
