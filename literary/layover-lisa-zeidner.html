  <title>Layover - Lisa Zeidner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Subtle, astute . . . With &lt;i&gt;Layover&lt;/i&gt;, Zeidner joins the ranks of Doris Lessing, Margaret Atwood and Fay Weldon.&quot; --Karen Karbo, &lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claire Newbold has watched her life collapse: her only child has died, her husband has been unfaithful, and she&#39;s just learned that she&#39;s infertile. She tries, dutifully, to go through the motions of her daily routine, but then she walks out of work on a whim, and soon she&#39;s living out of hotels--not always with the intention of paying for them--and confronting loss. As Claire indulges in a pattern of seduction and deception, she begins to feel that she is clairvoyant, capable of &quot;reading&quot; strangers without knowing them. As she struggles to find redemption in her marriage and her life, she finds herself wondering: Is she erratic or just full-on deranged?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisa Zeidner&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Layover &lt;/i&gt;is a provocative, affecting, and confident novel. As &lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt; said, &quot;Zeidner&#39;s writing is like her heroine: taut, intelligent, and seductive.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
