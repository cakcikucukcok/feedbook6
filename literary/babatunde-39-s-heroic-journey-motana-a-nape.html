  <title>Babatunde&#39;s Heroic Journey - Motana `a Nape</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An exciting new novel from South African author, Nape Motana.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Babatunde&amp;rsquo;s Heroic Journey&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is the story of Babatunde Okoronkwo, a Nigerian recipient of a Russian scholarship who does not return to his country once his schooling is complete. As the Soviet flag tumbles into a new epoch, he is consumed by zeal to be part of the transformation of a new society. He raises his hand and says, &amp;ldquo;Here am I, send me!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;having no idea where the answer to that prayer might lead him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hungry crocodiles trail him on his tortuous journey, determined to make minced meat of him and his dream. But Babatunde refuses to give in, even if following his faith is like signing a death warrant. The burden becomes back-breaking, so he asks to be blessed with a strong back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he&amp;rsquo;s eager to shout, &amp;ldquo;Hallelujah,&amp;rdquo; he senses a teeth-gnashing villain behind his back. And he&amp;rsquo;s reminded that the tiger is not tame and never changes its spots. When he reaches the point of no return, he ignores both real and false alarms&amp;mdash;because he has something to learn about being an African hero in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The novel is a captivating novel that kept me awake all through the night while exploring the trials and vicissitudes of Babatunde Okoronkwo. It is so well grounded in Igbo cosmology, belief systems and aesthetics that one would hardly believe that it was written by a South African author.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Professor Femi Shaka, University of Port Harcourt&lt;/p&gt;" />
