But as the son of a single father working in warehouses across the Pacific Northwest, Charley&#39;s been pretty much on his own. When tragic events leave him homeless weeks after their move to Portland, Oregon, Charley seeks refuge in the tack room of a run-down horse track. Charley&#39;s only comforts are his friendship with a failing racehorse named Lean on Pete and a photograph of his only known relative.
