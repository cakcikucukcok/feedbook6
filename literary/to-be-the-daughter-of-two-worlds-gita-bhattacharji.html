  <title>To Be the Daughter of Two Worlds - Gita Bhattacharji</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ask anyone who knows and loves her: Aunt Priya is a feisty little country bumpkin, a loud-mouthed, uncouth characterwith a heart of gold. She loves her only niece, Sita, and has made it her mission to see that the young woman is suitably married. Frustrated by the challenges of a long-distance relationship with her niece, Aunt Priya makes a bold plan. In the summer of 2001, Aunt Priya and her adopted four-year-old son Rohit arrive in New York. Despite her oddball character, limited English, and peculiar dress sense, she is determined to make a difference in her nieces modern and confusing new life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She enlists the help of her New York relatives, and together they plot, scheme, and manipulate Sita to get their way. But Sita isnt quite as malleable as they hoped. A New Yorker through and through, Sita is a contradiction: a modern Indian woman who both respects and questions her familys traditions. As the daughter of a traditional Indian household, shes bound by the expectations of her family and culture. Aunt Priya decides that Sita should never forget her roots, no matter where she lives.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Sita has her own challenges, including a breast cancer diagnosis and the serious injury of a loved one in the World Trade Center disaster. And now, her family wants to force her into an arranged marriage shes not really ready for. Can she find a way to find her own true love without disappointing her family?&lt;/p&gt;" />
