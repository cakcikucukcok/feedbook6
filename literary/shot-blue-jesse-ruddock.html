  <title>Shot-Blue - Jesse Ruddock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&#39;&lt;em&gt;Shot-Blue&lt;/em&gt; is that rarest species, a genuinely wise novel.&#39; - Rivka Galchen&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rachel is a young single mother living with her son, Tristan, on a lake that borders the unchannelled north - remote, nearly inhospitable. She does what she has to do to keep them alive. But soon, and unexpectedly, Tristan will have to live alone, his youth unprotected and rough. The wild, open place that is all he knows will be overrun by strangers - strangers inhabiting the lodge that has replaced his home, strangers who make him fight, talk, and even love, when he doesn&#39;t want to. Ravenous and unrelenting, &lt;em&gt;Shot-Blue&lt;/em&gt; is a book of first love and first loss.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The road was like a portage: an opening that lets you in but makes no promise to bring you out on another side. Maybe the road narrowed to a dead end or was blocked by a swamp raised by a beaver dam. Maybe it led to a place they weren&#39;t welcome. She walked through the cut slowly and stopped, her dark hair falling across her shoulders heavily, and Tristan imagined that she meant to let her hair sweep the ground as it did. Most boys would have run out to meet their mothers. But he knew he couldn&#39;t understand. She was always telling him,you can&#39;t understand everything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
