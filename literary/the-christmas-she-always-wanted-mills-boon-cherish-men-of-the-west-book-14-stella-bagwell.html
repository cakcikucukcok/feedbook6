  <title>The Christmas She Always Wanted (Mills &amp; Boon Cherish) (Men of the West, Book 14) - Stella Bagwell</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;A very special Christmas wish Single mum &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Angie Malone left Christmas wishes to her daughter. After all, nothing could fix the broken heart Angie had had since Jubal Jamison married another woman. She had never seen Jubal again…not even to say she was carrying his child.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But now a miracle might happen for Angie and her little girl. With Jubal hired as the vet for the Sandbur Ranch, there was a chance for father and daughter to find each other. And with Christmas just around the corner, perhaps Jubal and Angie could finally forgive the past – and become the family they’d always wanted to be…&lt;/p&gt;
