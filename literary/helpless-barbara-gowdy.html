  <title>Helpless - Barbara Gowdy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From the internationally acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The White Bone&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;The Romantic&lt;/i&gt;, a haunting and suspenseful novel of abduction and obsessive love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine-year-old Rachel Fox has the face of an angel, a heart-stopping luminosity that strikes all who meet her. Her single mother, Celia, working at a video store by day and a piano bar by night, is not always around to shield her daughter from the attention--both benign and sinister--that her beauty draws. Attention from model agencies, for example, or from Ron, a small-appliance repairman who, having seen Rachel once, is driven to see her again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a summer blackout plunges the city into darkness and confusion, Rachel is taken from her home. A full-scale search begins, but days pass with no solid clues, only a phone call Celia receives from a woman whose voice she has heard before but cannot place. And as Celia fights her terror and Rachel starts to trust in her abductor&#39;s kindness, the only other person who knows where she is wavers between loyalty to the captor and saving the child. Will Rachel be found before her abductor&#39;s urge to protect and cherish turns to something altogether less innocent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tapping into the fear that lies just below the surface of contemporary city life, Barbara Gowdy draws on her trademark empathy and precision to create a portrait of love at its most consuming and ambiguous and to uncover the volatile point at which desire gives way to the unthinkable.&lt;/p&gt;" />
