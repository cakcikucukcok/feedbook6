      <meta name="description" content="STILL FRIENDS A DECADE ON? WHAT ARE THE CHANCES?  For a while, Ian, Lauren and Paul shared the same friends, the same university, the same dreams and the same potential. Ten years on they are worlds apart. Call centres, charity shops and bedrooms that smell like cabbage were never part of the plan. The real world doesn&#39;t look quite like any of them imagined. But when Lauren, in a moment of nostalgia, cracks open a long-forgotten Hotmail account, she comes face to face with the people these three friends used to be . . .  For two of them it will mean a new beginning to an old love story.  Hilarious and heart-breaking, In Real Life paints a searingly honest portrait of a generation and captures a world where human connection is easier than ever before but where relationships remain just as tricky." />

In beautiful prose Chris Killen precisely captures the sharp, quiet sadness of Wetherspoons and Tesco Meal Deals and watching repeats of Grand Designs with your dinner on your knees.<br /><b><i>In Real Life by Chris Killen - Goodreads</i></b> | Chris Killen writes with an understated beauty about things like Tesco Meal Deals and the internet and hospitals and Babybels and the distance between people. In Real Life is a book about love and failed dreams that is full of truth and tenderness (MATT HAIG, author of The Humans) A thoughtful comedy of manners which has some truly great moments . . .<br /><b><i>In Real Life: Killen, Chris: 9781847672629: Amazon.com: Books</i></b> | In Real Life by Chris Killen review – a triangular love story for the digital age The emotional sincerity in this modern romance makes a refreshing change from the ironic tone found in many novels...<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>In Real Life - Chris Killen</a> </h3></p><hr/>
