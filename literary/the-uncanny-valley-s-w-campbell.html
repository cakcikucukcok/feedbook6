  <title>The Uncanny Valley - S W Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all know a Paul. A person who seems to see stuff that isn&amp;rsquo;t there. The type the polite call quirky and the blunt call nuts. Conspiracies? He&amp;rsquo;s got a few. He&amp;rsquo;s got his finger on how the world really works. He knows what kind of shit is coming down the pipe. Flee across the West Texas desert to Mexico? Makes sense to him. Feel like you&amp;rsquo;re being watched? You bet your ass someone is watching. Best turn off your cell phone. Troubles? Of course, that&amp;rsquo;s just part of life. Doubts? No time for doubts. Shit is getting real. Get in, buckle up, crack open a beer. The only real question is, how far down the rabbit hole are you willing to follow?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Paul is an every man gone off the rails. Fearing the tightening noose of government surveillance he sets out with his family on a twisting psychological jaunt to break free of society&amp;#39;s restrictions, no matter what the cost. Hero and villain. Culprit and victim. Paul is stuck in a world he wants no part of. Sacrifices are made and connections are severed. As his world collapses around him, Paul perseveres in his quest, unsure about his way forward, but increasingly feeling that there is no way for him to turn back.&lt;/p&gt;" />
