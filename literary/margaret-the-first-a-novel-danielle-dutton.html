  <title>Margaret the First: A Novel - Danielle Dutton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;One of both &lt;I&gt;Flavorwire&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;The Millions&lt;/I&gt; Most Anticipated Books of 2016&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Margaret the First&lt;/I&gt; dramatizes the life of Margaret Cavendish, the shy, gifted, and wildly unconventional 17th-century Duchess. The eccentric Margaret wrote and published volumes of poems, philosophy, feminist plays, and utopian science fiction at a time when &amp;#147;being a writer&amp;#8221; was not an option open to women. As one of the Queen&amp;#8217;s attendants and the daughter of prominent Royalists, she was exiled to France when King Charles I was overthrown. As the English Civil War raged on, Margaret met and married William Cavendish, who encouraged her writing and her desire for a career. After the War, her work earned her both fame and infamy in England: at the dawn of daily newspapers, she was &amp;#147;Mad Madge,&amp;#8221; an original tabloid celebrity. Yet Margaret was also the first woman to be invited to the Royal Society of London&amp;#151;a mainstay of the Scientific Revolution&amp;#151;and the last for another two hundred years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Margaret the First&lt;/I&gt; is very much a contemporary novel set in the past. Written with lucid precision and sharp cuts through time, it is a gorgeous and wholly new narrative approach to imagining the life of a historical woman.&lt;/div&gt;" />
