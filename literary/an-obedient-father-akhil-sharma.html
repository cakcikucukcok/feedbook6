  <title>An Obedient Father - Akhil Sharma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Corrosive, funny, and frightening--one of the year&#39;s most absorbing first novels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;My general incompetence and laziness at work had been apparent for so long that I now think it was arrogant of Mr. Gupta to pick me as his money man. I am the type of person who does not make sure that a file includes all the pages it must have or that the pages are in the right order.  I refuse to accept even properly placed blame, lying outright that somebody else misplaced the completed forms or spilled tea on them, even though I was the last one to sign them out, or had the soggy papers still on my desk.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an inspector for the Physical Education Department in the Delhi school system, Ram Karan supports his widowed daughter and eight-year-old granddaughter by collecting bribes for a small-time Congress Party boss. On the eve of Rajiv Gandhi&#39;s assassination, one reckless act bares the lifetime of violence and sexual shame behind Ram&#39;s dingy public career and involves him in a farcical, but terrifying, political campaign that could cost him his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An astonishing character study, a portrait of a family--and a country--tormented by the past, Akhil Sharma&#39;s &lt;i&gt;An Obedient Father&lt;/i&gt; recalls Dostoyevsky&#39;s guilt-ridden anti-heroes in this fully formed debut novel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
