  <title>The Texan&#39;s Convenient Marriage (Mills &amp; Boon Desire) (A Piece of Texas, Book 2) - Peggy Moreland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;SHE WAS PREGNANT WITH HIS BROTHER&#39;S BABY&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mack McGruder was there to pay her off…another one of his ne&#39;er-do-well brother&#39;s women, claiming paternity. But Addy truly was having a McGruder heir…at that exact moment.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HE OFFERED HER AN IN-NAME-ONLY MARRIAGE&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;At her side during the birth, Mack knew he couldn&#39;t just abandon her. So he offered Addy a name for her baby and a hands-off marriage, though secretly he desired her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;BUT HE WANTED MORE&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Together in his grand Texas home, the temptation was unbearable. If Mack took what he truly wanted, would having Addy be worth the price he&#39;d have to pay?&lt;/p&gt;
