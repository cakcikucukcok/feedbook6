  <title>Becoming JiJi - David R Yale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jill Frisk, 18-year-old daughter of a violent father and shattered mother, has no plans, no hope. She is a straight-A high school graduate, but her 1970s blue collar neighborhood in North Minneapolis discourages women&amp;rsquo;s dreams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although she reads advanced chemistry books as a hobby, her father won&amp;rsquo;t allow her to go to college. The prospect of an existence like her mother&amp;rsquo;s holds Jill in the grip of depression.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Stern, the new recreation director, sees Jill differently. He hires her to run a preschool group and assists her in founding a teen council that uplifts the neighborhood. With his encouragement, she rises above her depression and discovers she has a world-class singing voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Empowered with the promise of a future she never dreamed possible, Jill finds a safe home for her family and brings her mother back to life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jill falls in love with Joe, but she&amp;rsquo;s too shy to tell him before he suddenly leaves town. Will new, improved Jill have the guts to pursue him, woo him, help him overcome his secret past, win his hand, and become a successful musician?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Becoming JiJi&lt;/em&gt; is an antidote to America&amp;rsquo;s current wave of dystopian fear, confusion, and hopelessness. It&amp;rsquo;s a great story about &amp;ldquo;ordinary&amp;rdquo; blue-collar Americans changing themselves from defeated cynics to high achievers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The novel weaves resistance to racism, classism, domestic violence, sexism, and sexual harassment into a heart-warming story of empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll love this story by an award-winning author, filled with touching portrayals of ordinary people. The characters seem so real they&amp;rsquo;ll feel like your good friends. JiJi will raise your spirits and inspire you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Includes links to performances of music mentioned in the book, and an original English translation of Schubert&amp;rsquo;s song, &lt;em&gt;Du Bist die Ruh&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
