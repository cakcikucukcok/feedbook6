          &lt;strong&gt;Tempted to make her his bride?&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Millionaire Ethan Hayes considered Eve to be a spoilt little rich girl hell-bent on bringing men to their knees. But when she was senselessly attacked, Ethan offered to pose as her fiancé to calm her elderly Greek grandfather&#39;s fears.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Suddenly Ethan was with Eve 24/7, and it was all he could do to prevent himself from giving in to temptation. Because, at the end of the coming fortnight, their mock engagement would be over. Then, surely, Ethan would be forgotten as Eve continued on her wicked, teasing way…?&lt;/p&gt;
