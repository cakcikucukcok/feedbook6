  <title>The Marriage Artist - Andrew Winer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Two mysterious deaths unlock one man&#39;s past and another&#39;s future in this moving tale of art, love, and history&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the wife of renowned art critic Daniel Lichtmann plunges to her death, she is not alone. Lying next to her is her suspected lover, Benjamin Wind, the very artist Daniel most championed. Tormented by questions about the circumstances of their deaths, Daniel dedicates himself to uncovering the secrets of their relationship and the inspiration behind Wind&#39;s dazzling final exhibition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Daniel discovers is a web of mysteries leading back to pre-World War II Vienna and the magnificent life of Josef Pick, a forgotten artist who may have been the twentieth century&#39;s greatest painter of love. But the most astonishing discoveryis what connects these two artists acrosshalf a century: a remarkable woman whose response to the tragedy of her generation offers Daniel answers to the questions he never knew to ask.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ambitious, haunting, and stunningly written, &lt;i&gt;The Marriage Artist&lt;/i&gt; tells a universal tale of a family dramatically reshaped by the quest for personal freedom in the face of inherited beliefs, public prejudices, and the unfathomable turns of history. It is at once a provocative snapshot of contemporary marriage, the recovery of a passion that history never recorded, and a fierce reminder of the way we enlist love in our perpetual search for meaning and permanence.&lt;/p&gt;" />
