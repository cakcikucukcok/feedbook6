  <title>The Magic Journey - John Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Boom times came to the forgotten little southwestern town of Chamisaville just as the rest of America was in the Great Depression. They came when a rattletrap bus loaded with stolen dynamite blew sky-high, leaving behind a giant gushing hot spring. Within minutes, the town&#39;s wheeler-dealers had organized, and within a year, Chamisaville was flooded with tourists and pilgrims, and the wheeler-dealers were rich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spanning forty years, &lt;i&gt;The Magic Journey &lt;/i&gt;tells the tale of how progress transformed a rural backwater into a boomtown. At first, it was a magic time for Chamisaville--almost as if every day were a holiday. But the euphoria gradually dissipated, and the land-hungry developers, speculators, and interlopers moved in. Finally, the day came when Chamisaville&#39;s people found themselves all but displaced, their children no longer heirs to their land or their tradition. With mounting intensity, &lt;i&gt;The Magic Journey &lt;/i&gt;reaches a climax that is tragically foreordained. A sensitive, vital, and honest chronicle of life in America&#39;s Southwest, it is also an incisive commentary on what America has become on its road to progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Magic Journey&lt;/i&gt; is part of the &lt;i&gt;New Mexico Trilogy&lt;/i&gt;, which includes &lt;i&gt;The Milagro Beanfield War &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Nirvana Blues&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
