  <title>Acceptance - Susan Coll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A comic chronicle of a year in the life in the college admissions cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s spring break of junior year and the college admissions hysteria is setting in. &quot;AP&quot; Harry (so named for the unprecedented number of advanced placement courses he has taken) and his mother take a detour from his first choice, Harvard, to visit Yates, a liberal arts school in the Northeast that is enjoying a surge in popularity as a result of a statistical error that landed it on the top-fifty list of the &lt;i&gt;U.S. News &amp; World Report &lt;/i&gt;rankings. There, on Yates&#39;s dilapidated grounds, Harry runs into two of his classmates from Verona High, an elite public school in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. There&#39;s Maya Kaluantharana, a gifted athlete whose mediocre SAT scores so alarm her family that they declare her learning disabled, and Taylor Rockefeller, Harry&#39;s brooding neighbor, who just wants a good look at the dormitory bathrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the human spirit of Tom Perrotta and the engaging honesty of Curtis Sittenfeld&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Prep&lt;/i&gt;, Susan Coll reveals the frantic world of college admissions, where kids recalibrate their GPAs based on daily quizzes, families relocate to enhance the chance for Ivy League slots, and everyone is looking for the formula for admittance. Meanwhile, Yates admissions officer Olivia Sheraton sifts through applications looking for something-anything-to distinguish one applicant from the next. For all, the price of admission requires compromise; for a few, the ordeal blossoms into an unexpected journey of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;" />
