  <title>Just the Nudge I Needed - Timothy M. Zuverink</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;English as a Second Language instructor Trevor McCall lives with his cat in a studio apartment on the north side of Chicago. Its not a bad life but its far from what Trevor pictured for himself at age 38. Not only is he struggling financially, hes also alone. And having been single for the last four years, hes beginning to fear it will become a permanent condition. Nice guys finish last, or so hes been told, and Trevor is definitely a kindhearted, contemplative soul. When not teaching, Trevor tries to fill his time with various cultural pursuits. And while fulfilling, he lacks that one special person to share it all with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One day Trevor and Scotta musician hes befriended who has recently moved into his buildingrun into a stranger at their local pet supply store and Trevor cant keep his eyes off the handsome somewhat older man. By chance Scott later runs into the same man and decides to make contact on Trevors behalf. It turns out hes a Greek-American named Nick who lives in their neighborhood. And he owns a beautiful Shiba Inu named Jefferson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trevor himself spots Nick one night and from somewhere deep inside musters up the courage to approach. There is an instant rapport between them and soon they become romantically involved. Nick is everything Trevor has ever wanted in a partner, and although commitment is scary, Trevor knows that Nick is just the nudge hes needed to get his life moving forward again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
