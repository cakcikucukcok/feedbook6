  <title>The Name of the World - Denis Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The acclaimed author of &lt;em&gt;Jesus&#39; Son&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Already Dead&lt;/em&gt; returns with a beautiful, haunting, and darkly comic novel. &lt;em&gt;The Name of the World&lt;/em&gt; is a mesmerizing portrait of a professor at a Midwestern university who has been patient in his grief after an accident takes the lives of his wife and child and has permitted that grief to enlarge him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Reed is living a posthumous life. In spite of outward appearances -- he holds a respectable university teaching position; he is an articulate and attractive addition to local social life -- he&#39;s a dead man walking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing can touch Reed, nothing can move him, although he observes with a mordant clarity the lives whirling vigorously around him. Of his recent bereavement, nearly four years earlier, he observes, &quot;I&#39;m speaking as I&#39;d speak of a change in the earth&#39;s climate, or the recent war.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facing the unwelcome end of his temporary stint at the university, Reed finds himself forced &quot;to act like somebody who cares what happens to him. &quot; Tentatively he begins to let himself make contact with a host of characters in this small academic town, souls who seem to have in common a tentativeness of their own. In this atmosphere characterized, as he says, &quot;by cynicism, occasional brilliance, and small, polite terror,&quot; he manages, against all his expectations, to find people to light his way through his private labyrinth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elegant and incisively observed, &lt;em&gt;The Name of the World&lt;/em&gt; is Johnson at his best: poignant yet unsentimental, replete with the visionary imaginative detail for which his work is known. Here is a tour de force by one of the most astonishing writers at work today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
