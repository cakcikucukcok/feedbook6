  <title>Beast - Paul Kingsnorth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The stunning new novel from the prizewinning author of &lt;i&gt;The Wake&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beast&lt;/i&gt; plunges you into the world of Edward Buckmaster, a man alone on an empty moor in the west of England. What he has left behind we don&#39;t yet know. What he faces is an existential battle with himself, the elements, and something he begins to see in the margins of his vision: some creature that is tracking him, the pursuit of which will become an obsession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This short, shocking, and exhilarating novel is a vivid exploration of isolation, courage, and the search for truth that continues the story set one thousand years earlier in Paul Kingsnorth&#39;s bravura debut novel, &lt;i&gt;The Wake&lt;/i&gt;. It extends that book&#39;s promise and confirms Kingsnorth as one of our most daring and rewarding contemporary writers.&lt;/p&gt;" />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Beast - Paul Kingsnorth</i></b> | “Beast” by British novelist and writer Paul Kingsnorth is one of most unusual novels I’ve read. It’s the second in what Kingsnorth calls the “Buckmaster Trilogy” (the first being “The Wake”) but it’s a standalone novel.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Beast: A Novel (9781555977795): Kingsnorth ...</i></b> | Paul Kingsnorth is an English writer and thinker. He is a former deputy-editor of The Ecologist and a co-founder of the Dark Mountain Project. He lives in the west of Ireland. He studied modern history at Oxford University, where he was also heavily involved in the road protest movement of the early 1990s.<br /><b><i>Beast by Paul Kingsnorth - Goodreads</i></b> | Beast continues Kingsnorth’s powerful exploration of the connection between people, place and prose . . . this is a novel bravely wrestling not only with the bestial, but with what it is that makes us human.
