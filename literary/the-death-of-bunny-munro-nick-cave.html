  <title>The Death of Bunny Munro - Nick Cave</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Set adrift by his wife&#39;s suicide and struggling to keep a grip on reality, Bunny Munro does the only thing he can think of: with his young son in tow, he hits the road. To his son, waiting patiently in the car while his father peddles beauty wares and quickies to lonely housewives in the south of England, Bunny is a hero, larger than life. But Bunny himself, haunted by what might be his wife&#39;s ghost, seems only dimly aware of his son&#39;s existence. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When his bizarre trip shades into a final reckoning, when he can no longer be sure what is real and what is not, Bunny finally begins to recognize the love he feels for his son. And he sees that the revenants of his world--decrepit fathers, vengeful ghosts, jealous husbands and horned psychokillers--are lurking in the shadows, waiting to exact their toll. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At turns dark and humane, &lt;i&gt;The Death of Bunny Munro&lt;/i&gt; is a tender portrait of the relationship between a boy and his father, with all the wit and enigma that fans will recognize as Nick Cave&#39;s singular vision.&lt;/p&gt;" />
