        &lt;p&gt;Gary Lindstrom doesn&#39;t remember ever being a child named Lucien. So when his long-lost sister calls to remind him of who he was, he tells her he&#39;s not interested. But even he can&#39;t resist the pull of the past, and he goes to meet the only family he has left. Little does he know that he&#39;s also going to meet Rebecca Wilson….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rebecca has never met anyone like Gary. He&#39;s attractive and successful, but determined to go through life alone. His first attempt at marriage was a bust and he doesn&#39;t want kids. She knows there&#39;s no future for them. But how can either ignore what&#39;s developing between them?&lt;/p&gt;
