  <title>Dead Writers in Rehab - Paul Bassett Davies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When literary reprobate Foster James wakes up in a strange country house, he assumes he&#39;s been consigned to rehab (yet again) by his dwindling band of friends and growing collection of ex-wives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he soon realises there&#39;s something a bit different about this place after he gets punched in the face by Ernest Hemingway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is Foster dead? Has his less-than-saintly existence finally caught up with him? After an acrimonious group therapy session with Hunter S Thompson, Colette, William Burroughs, and Coleridge, it seems pretty likely. But he still &lt;i&gt;feels&lt;/i&gt; alive, especially after an up-close and personal one-on-one session with Dorothy Parker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he discovers that the two enigmatic doctors who run the institution are being torn apart by a thwarted love affair, he and the other writers must work together to save something that, for once, is bigger than their own gigantic egos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a love story. It&#39;s for anyone who loves writing and writers. It&#39;s also a story about the strange and terrible love affair between creativity and addiction, told by a charming, selfish bastard who finally confronts his demons in a place that&#39;s part Priory, part Purgatory, and where the wildest fiction can tell the soberest truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
