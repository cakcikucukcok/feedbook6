  <title>Lily in Red - C.P. Kent</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For years Tina Devers&#39; lonely mundane life has been plagued by frightening dreams, brought on by years of suppressed guilt and fear-the guilt of causing a terrible accident that killed her mother and sister, and the fear of her father, who she believes hates her for what happened all those years ago. This guilt and fear cause her nights to be filled with haunting dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only real friend Tina has is Lily, the big cloth doll with brown yarn ponytails from Tina&#39;s childhood. It is in Lily that Tina confides her most private thoughts and confesses her deepest secrets. Tina&#39;s only means of escape is the office where she works-the only place where she feels secure and in control of her life. But disturbing events cause the safety of that haven to be destroyed and the tension at home to worsen, triggering even more haunting dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then architect Ben Collins comes into Tina&#39;s life and evokes feelings she never dreamed of, introducing her to a kind of love she never expected to find. With that love comes dreams that are filled with more guilt and fear, but there is also the possibility that Tina will be able to leave her childhood demons in the past. Will Ben&#39;s love for Tina be strong enough to help her overcome her past?&lt;/p&gt;" />
