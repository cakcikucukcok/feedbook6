  <title>The Divers&#39; Game - Jesse Ball</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the inimitable mind of award-winning author Jesse Ball, a novel about an unsettlingly familiar society that has renounced the concept of equality&amp;#8212;and the devastating consequences of unmitigated power&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The old-fashioned struggle for fairness has finally been abandoned. It was a misguided endeavor. The world is divided into two groups, pats and quads. The pats may kill the quads as they like, and do. The quads have no recourse but to continue with their lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Divers&amp;#8217; Game&lt;/em&gt; is a thinly veiled description of our society, an extreme case that demonstrates a truth: we must change or our world will collapse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the effect of constant fear on a life, or on a culture? &lt;em&gt;The Divers&amp;#8217; Game&lt;/em&gt; explores the consequences of violence through two festivals, and through the dramatic and excruciating examination of a woman&amp;#8217;s final moments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brilliantly constructed and achingly tender,&amp;#160;&lt;em&gt;The Divers&amp;#8217; Game&lt;/em&gt; shatters the notion of common decency as the binding agent between individuals, forcing us to consider whether compassion is intrinsic to the human experience. With his signature empathy and ingenuity, Jesse Ball&amp;#8217;s latest work solidifies his reputation as one of contemporary fiction&amp;#8217;s most mesmerizing talents.&lt;/p&gt;" />
