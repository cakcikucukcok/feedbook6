  <title>Sea Monsters - Chloe Aridjis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;li&gt;Seventeen-year-old Luisa&#39;s narrative voice is wildly immersive and utterly believable, and her wry, keen-eyed cadence lends &lt;i&gt;Sea Monsters&lt;/i&gt; its singular sense of the story&#39;s place and time in 1980s Mexico 
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sea Monsters&lt;/i&gt; is a sharp story, one with heart, with punk and surrealist undertones; a sort of Mexican &lt;i&gt;Weetzie Bat&lt;/i&gt; meets Eve Babitz&#39;s sense of place meets Knausgaard&#39;s autobiographical realism meets Elena Ferrante&#39;s gift for characters
&lt;li&gt;The novel is inspired by a true story; Aridjis ran away from home at age sixteen, and her father came looking for her; as such, the narrator feels intimate and fully formed, and her simultaneous teenage skepticism and buoyant, hopeful adventure-seeking is natural and addictive to read
&lt;li&gt;Chloe Aridjis was born in New York and grew up in the Netherlands and Mexico City; she received her B.A. from Harvard University in Cambridge, MA
&lt;li&gt;The author has been compared by critics to Haruki Murakami, Walter Benjamin, and W. G. Sebald
&lt;li&gt;Bookstores and readers across the country are hungry for narratives and perspectives that counteract the wall-building and border-closing agendas of the current American political administration; the success of writers like Luiselli and Herrera point to a thriving moment for Mexican and Mexican American literature; and as the author says of her impetus to write the novel, &quot;I wanted to write about a time in Mexico when the harrowing drug violence had yet to cast a pall over the country, and young people felt free enough to enact their daydreams.&quot;
&lt;li&gt;Of particular interest for independent booksellers: In 2015, Chloe was the guest curator of the Leonora Carrington exhibition at Tate Liverpool. She is also the daughter of Homero Aridjis (and the translator of his 2016 &lt;i&gt;The Child Poet&lt;/i&gt;, from Archipelago)" />
