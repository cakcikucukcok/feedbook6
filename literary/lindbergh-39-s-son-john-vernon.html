  <title>Lindbergh&#39;s Son - John Vernon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&amp;#147;All this began long before I died,&amp;#8221; says the brain in a jar that narrates John Vernon&amp;#8217;s second novel.  The brain once belonged to Charles Cooper, a 55-year-old water engineer in upstate New York, and has been kept alive by a perfusion pump invented by the man who may have been Coop&amp;#8217;s father&amp;#150;Charles Lindbergh.  Then again, maybe not.  Coop&amp;#8217;s suspicion that he is the kidnaped Lindbergh baby who never really died but instead was stolen as a child and raised by gangsters begins when, on a day like any other, while playing basketball with his ne&amp;#8217;re-do-well stepson, two women approach him, one claiming to be the mother he thought long dead, the other his sister.  &amp;#147;As a rule, I&amp;#8217;m not a paranoid man,&amp;#8221; he says, but these persistent strangers initiate a chain of clues and strange events that open before him like a bottomless pit.  His search for an identity locks him inside a labyrinth of memory, historical detective work, deceit and obsession.  Is he Lindbergh&amp;#8217;s son or the victim of an elaborate hoax designed to rob him of his inheritance?  And is he deranged or rather is it &amp;#147;reality,&amp;#8221; as he says, that &amp;#147;has come down with an illness.&amp;#8221;?  Lindbergh&amp;#8217;s Son is a map of a peculiar kind of American megalomania, one whose genealogies are floating, roots shallow, and borders ever shifting. &lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;Franz Kafka, I think, is Mr. Vernon&amp;#8217;s true master . . . [His] story, with bits of new and old news falling into contradictory configurations, will excite those who love a mystery.  It&amp;#8217;s a dark dream, told with twin passions for intellectual process and the bizarre required by this particular dark age.&amp;#8221; &amp;#150; New York Times Book Review&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;Striking and original and never dull . . . Truly novel, truly chancy and subversive.&amp;#8221; &amp;#150; St. Petersburg Times&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;A fascinating book, full of intrigue, verbal luminosity, and mysterious thrills.  Vernon&amp;#8217;s imagination is all over the place with a virtuoso&amp;#8217;s irreverence for standard procedures.  Let the reader beware and be dazzled by this rising and unique voice in American literature.&amp;#8221; &amp;#150; John Nichols, author of The Milagro Beanfield War and The Sterile Cuckoo&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&amp;#147;We are soon caught up in the autobiography of this brain&amp;#150;the way it shifts and assimilates facts, exchanges imagination and memory, forgets to remember, anything to justify itself, to keep on going.&amp;#8221; &amp;#150; Washington Post Book World&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
