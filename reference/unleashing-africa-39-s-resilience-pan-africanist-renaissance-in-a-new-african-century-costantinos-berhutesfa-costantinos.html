  <title>Unleashing Africa&#39;s Resilience: Pan Africanist Renaissance In a New African Century - Costantinos Berhutesfa Costantinos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Africa includes five of the world&#39;s fastest-growing economies, as well as a treasure chest of natural resources. Those very things, however, have caused multinational corporations to flock to the continent in an attempt take control of those resources.   An African renaissance is hard to conceptualize, but that is exactly what is beginning to effect real change, with the assistance of both public officials and ordinary citizens. This study theorizes an African renaissance as the dynamic interaction of strategy and process and seeks to motivate researchers to shift analysis in that direction. This shift emphasizes the task of broadly structuring African renaissance as a geopolitical system is more important than that of promoting it within a specific program of nations.   Unleashing Africa&#39;s Resilience provides the necessary tools for research-based policymaking and the critical thinking needed to help Africa build a vibrant economy and become a more prominent player on the world stage." />
