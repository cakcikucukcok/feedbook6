  <title>Instructions for Chinese Women and Girls - Zhao Ban, Esther E Jerman, Susan Blumberg-Kason</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Little known today,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Instructions for Chinese Women&amp;nbsp;and Girls&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;has a storied place in Chinese history as the first educational text for women and a standard reference for them from the first century AD all the way into the nineteenth. Polymath author Ban Zhao was perhaps China&amp;rsquo;s greatest female scholar. A writer, historian, mathematician, and astronomer, she was also a tutor to the ladies of the imperial court and a close confidant of Empress Deng. Although Ban Zhao completed a monumental historical tome on the Western Han dynasty, she would be best remembered for this slighter work &amp;ndash; a short handbook of female etiquette in which she advises submissiveness in order to achieve household harmony. A kind of women&amp;rsquo;s&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Art of War&lt;/em&gt;, there is more yielding than winning in the guidebook, but at least Ban Zhao was a pioneer in asserting that girls should be educated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instructions for Chinese Girls and Women&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is an easy, enjoyable read. It contains passages preaching subservience that will make the modern reader cringe and/or laugh, but there is interesting nuance there for readers with an open mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The husband commands, the wife obeys;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Yet let there be mutual grace and love;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are timeworn, universal complaints:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The present generation&amp;rsquo;s children are very bad;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;They have learned nothing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there are humorous warnings against immoral immodesty:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Imitate not those rude women who with confusion eat, drink, and talk;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Drinking wine until crazy, they shamefully vomit their food;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;In this state going home, before reaching their house, many shameful, rude acts will they do.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This Camphor Press edition has illustrations and a new introduction from Susan Blumberg-Kason, author of the memoir&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Good Chinese Wife&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
