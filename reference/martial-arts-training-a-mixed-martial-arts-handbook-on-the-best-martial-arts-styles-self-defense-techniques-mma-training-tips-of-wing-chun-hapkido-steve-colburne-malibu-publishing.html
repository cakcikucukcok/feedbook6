  <title>Martial Arts Training: A Mixed Martial Arts Handbook on the Best Martial Arts Styles &amp; Self Defense Techniques MMA Training Tips of Wing Chun, Hapkido - Steve Colburne, Malibu Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anytime an individual decides to learn how to protect themselves, learn self-defense, or become a better person, one thing comes to mind - martial arts.  Martial arts are very common these days, being practiced all over the world.    The martial arts have been used for many centuries, although they really became famous around the time of Bruce Lee.  Bruce invented the style of Jeet Kune Do, which involves very fast strikes with amazing counter defenses.  Once people began to see just how fast Bruce Lee could move, they began to look into martial arts and see just how it could benefit them.  Martial arts are broken down into specific styles.  The style all depends on where and what you study.  A lot of cultures and countries offer martial arts that they originated, developed, and perfected.  Brazil offers Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Japan has Karate, Thailand has Muay Thai, France has Savate, and China has Shaolin.  Keep in mind that each style will vary in techniques and what it has to offer you." />
