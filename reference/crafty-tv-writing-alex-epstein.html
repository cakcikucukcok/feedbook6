  <title>Crafty TV Writing - Alex Epstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A professional TV writer&#39;s real-world guide to getting paid to write great television&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;No need for me to ever write a book on TV writing. Alex Epstein has covered it all . . . along with a few things I wouldn&#39;t have thought of. Save yourself five years of rookie mistakes. &lt;i&gt;Crafty TV Writing&lt;/i&gt; and talent are pretty much all you&#39;ll need to make it.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;--Ken Levine, writer/producer, &lt;i&gt;MASH&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Cheers&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Frasier&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;The Simpsons&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Wings&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Becker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone watches television, and everyone has an opinion on what makes good TV. But, as Alex Epstein shows in this invaluable guide, writing for television is a highly specific craft that requires knowledge, skill, and more than a few insider&#39;s tricks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epstein, a veteran TV writer and show creator himself, provides essential knowledge about the entire process of television writing, both for beginners and for professionals who want to go to the next level. &lt;i&gt;Crafty TV Writing&lt;/i&gt; explains how to decode the hidden structure of a TV series. It describes the best ways to generate a hook, write an episode, create characters the audience will never tire of, construct entertaining dialogue, and use humor. It shows how to navigate the tough but rewarding television industry, from writing your first &quot;spec&quot; script, to getting hired to work on a show, to surviving--even thriving--if you get fired. And it illuminates how television writers think about the shows they&#39;re writing, whether they&#39;re working in comedy, drama, or &quot;reality.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fresh, funny, and informed, &lt;i&gt;Crafty TV Writing&lt;/i&gt; is the essential guide to writing for and flourishing in the world of television.&lt;/p&gt;" />
