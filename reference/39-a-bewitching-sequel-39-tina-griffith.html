  <title>&#39;A Bewitching Sequel&#39; - Tina Griffith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This whimsical, curiously charming, enchanting story, takes place twenty years after the ending of The Handsome Farmhouse Ghost.
Echo Hudson is all grown up in this sequel and now becomes the new Head Witch.  But before that fabulous event can take place, people die, others get wed, glorious spells get conjured up, and powerful ingredients for potions get mixed together and are then put into action.
Yes, we are talking about witches, warlocks and angry sorcerers.  Some of the same characters from the first installment are brought back in this story, and we are lucky enough to be introduced to new ones.
At times, the storyline to A Bewitching Sequel is intriguing, spellbinding, and makes you feel like you are hanging on the edge of a cliff.  It is also amusing, comical, and wonderfully entertaining.  Its a page-turner that has you craving to find out how its all going to end.  With the final words on the last page, you will then want to know what happens next.
Tina is an award-winning author who began writing romance novels in 2005.  She touches your heart and connects you with her characters from the first page.  She brings you into the storyline and makes you feel like you are part of the plot." />
