  <title>Evaluation of Commercially Available Flame Retardants for Production of Carbon Fabric - Lilly O. Iwuchukwu Bs. Msc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book compared the use of flame retardant chemicals known as pyroset TPO and TKC in the production of carbon fabrics from cotton precursors. Information about the chemical was collected from the American Cyanamid company, textile and chemical division. Data was also furnished by the test fabric incorporated for the two fabrics it manufacturedmercerize 100 percent cotton sheeting, style #409 and unmercerized 100 percent cotton sheeting, style #409. The percentage of carbon remaining from each sample in all the categories was obtained through carbon analysis conducted by Galbraith Laboratories Incorporated. Percent char data were calculated from data obtained before and after pyrolysis. The results are presented and discussed with the aid of a 2(5) factorial design pattern used for the overall design of the experiment.
Personal reflections on how to save the lives of infants and children, even our geriatric parents that are trapped in a burning home, with much higher statistics for rescuing them to safety. More safety resulting in having flame retardant nightwear, even home furnishings and more as time goes on. Common sense, logic, and sensible ideology in our twenty-first century. Creating safety living all around should be a right and our responsibilitya value that we should be well invested in. Research funding in the textile industry and for educators has been seriously almost nonexistent that humanity is still struggling for a safe technology for utilizing materials for public safety. Public trust must be secured by specifying performance of treated fabrics safe from fire and the extinguishing of flames, less toxic to protect and enhance our democratic ideals of freedom living in the western hemisphere. The world is in need of safe discovery for flame retardants, material to be used in active wears, home furniture, establish standard of assessments and accountability measures to be the research for the future.
More and continued research is required for the textile industry. Research and more and ongoing research and funding is desperately needed. This is to empower readers and educators and students to bring great and creative ideas and ideals tog textile research back and be fully funded; to encourage companies to give funding for creating perpetual workforce for the future, economic stability, safety, and security without end." />
