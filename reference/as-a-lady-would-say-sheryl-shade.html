  <title>As a Lady Would Say - Sheryl Shade</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever been in a situation in which you were caught off guard, left speechless, or, worse yet, put your foot in your mouth?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This easily accessible book focuses on those moments when knowing exactly what to say is both a challenge and important. From the light-hearted &quot;how to react when your boyfriend gives you a blender as a gift&quot; or &quot;what to say when you run into another lady at a party wearing exactly the same dress&quot; to the more serious &quot;what to say to a friend who has had a miscarriage or to a friend who has suffered the sudden death of a parent.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;As A Lady Would Say&lt;/em&gt; differs from other etiquette books. It not only offers suggestions for the correct thing to say in more than 100 social situations, but it gives humorous examples of the wrong thing to say as well.  Saying the right thing requires a little logic, a bit of forethought, and a great deal of consideration for others. With the advice provided in this book, a lady will never need to stumble or stutter again.&lt;/p&gt;" />
