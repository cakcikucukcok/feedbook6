  <title>A Dictionary of Critical Theory - Ian Buchanan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Containing over 750 in-depth entries, this is the most wide-ranging and up-to-date dictionary of critical theory available. This authoritative guide covers the whole range of critical theory, including the Frankfurt school, cultural materialism, cultural studies, gender studies, film studies, literary theory, hermeneutics, historical materialism, and socio-political critical theory. Entries clearly explain complex theoretical discourses such as Marxism,
psychoanalysis, structuralism, deconstruction, and postmodernism. There are biographies of hundreds of important figures in the field, with feature entries for those who have heavily influenced areas of the discipline, such as Derrida and Deleuze.
This new edition of the dictionary has been updated to extend coverage of diaspora, race and postcolonial theory, including key authors such as C. L. R. James and Paul Gilroy, and of queer and sexuality studies, including notable figures such as Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick. Fully revised to keep up to date with this diverse field, this new edition expands the coverage to include entries such as hyperobject and
transgender.
Entries are fully cross-referenced and many contain further reading suggestions.
Covering all aspects of critical theory from globalization and race studies, to queer theory and feminism, this multidisciplinary A-Z is essential for students in the humanities and social sciences." />
