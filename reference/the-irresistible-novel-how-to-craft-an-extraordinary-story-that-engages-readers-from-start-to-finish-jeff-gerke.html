  <title>The Irresistible Novel: How to Craft an Extraordinary Story That Engages Readers from Start to Finish - Jeff Gerke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Discover Your Voice and Enthrall Readers!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The craft of writing is filled with various debates: Should I include a prologue? Should I delete all adverbs from my manuscript? Just how much backstory--if any--can I include in my story? These questions--and their often-contradictory answers--can cause confusion, frustration, and even paralysis in the writer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Irresistible Novel&lt;/i&gt; frees you from the limits of so-called &quot;rules&quot; and instead provides you with a singular goal: You must engage your readers from beginning to end. Filled with down-to-earth discussions on the various debates of writing, as well as innovative research on neuroscience and reader response, this book shows you how to:&lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Navigate the various debates on writing fiction--showing versus telling, purple prose, outlining, writing description, and more--to decide what kind of novelist you want to be.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Hack your reader&#39;s brain to hook her interest and trigger emotional engagement from the very first page.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Incorporate enduring elements of storytelling from masters like Joseph Campbell, Aristotle, and Carl Jung.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; Readers want to be swept away by your stories. When you eschew the rules and focus on your readers&#39; desires, you&#39;re free to write truly irresistible fiction.&lt;/p&gt;" />
