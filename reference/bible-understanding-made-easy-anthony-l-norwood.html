      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Bible Understanding Made Easy&lt;/I&gt; is a series of books used to inspire and teach the Word of God to sincere souls that are trying to draw closer to God. This volume is dedicated to building understanding of the Old Testament portion of the Holy Bible.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Many of the worlds prominent religions are based on the teachings of the Old Testament including Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In fact, Christian students of the Bible will have a hard time understanding the teachings of Jesus and His apostles without a firm foundational understanding of the Old Testament.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The method of teaching used in this book was purposely kept as simple as possible so that beginning students of the Bible can be inspired and build a rich foundation of understanding the Bible that will last a lifetime!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The main themes of each chapter, and many times, entire books of the Bible are presented to help one understand particular verses that may confuse sincere students of the Bible. Lastly, as an added bonus, there are many life application style mini-lessons that Christians of today can use to help build faith, encourage, and inspire sincere folks to maintain a personal relationship with Jesus Christ.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For ordering within the United States of America and outside of the United States of America please call (toll-free in the U.S.) 1-888-795-4274 or Email XLibris at orders@xlibris.com.
