  <title>Love Notes from God - Amanda Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Grief and loss are taboo subjects. 
A mother doesn&#39;t want to talk about her child who died.  Or does she?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A woman who miscarries isn&#39;t losing as much as a mother who loses a newborn.  Or is she?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A father doesn&#39;t grieve as much as a mother.  Or does he?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our culture is full of misconceptions about grief and loss.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Few mention the thousands of miscarriages and stillbirths, the babies and small children who die every day, leaving parents with empty arms and grieving hearts.  The journey through grief can be long and lonely for the families left behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love Notes from God&lt;/i&gt; examines how parents cope when they go through a miscarriage or lose an infant. Find out what you can say or do to help them, and also learn what is never appropriate to say to someone who is grieving.&lt;/p&gt;" />
