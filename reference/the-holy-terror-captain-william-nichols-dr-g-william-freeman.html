  <title>The Holy Terror: Captain William Nichols - Dr. G. William Freeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Captain Nichols was a naval war hero in the
War of 1812. He has been seldom mentioned
in history books. He was a bold and daring
privateer sea captain from Newburyport,
MA, who was known as a man to be feared
by the British who faced him on the sea. His
story needs to be brought out of the shadows
of history.
During the War, he captured 28 British Prizes,
although one-half of the time he was in prison
earning for himself the name of The Holy Terror
wherever seamen gathered.
H.W. Bartlett
Upon his capture in the privateer Decatur, he was held in a cage constructed for him on
the deck of a British frigate and deprived of communication with others for a month.
He was then held in chains on a prison-ship in Chatham Harbor, England for a year
and a half. President Madison ordered two British offi cers held in close confi nement in
the United States in response to Nichols cruel and inhumane treatment. Nichols was
eventually exchanged for the two offi cers and returned to the United States.
Following his imprisonment, he continued his naval battles against the British,
completing two successful cruises on the fast-sailing privateer Harpy by the end of the
war. His story rivals the tales of swashbuckling pirates that have inspired the minds of
the greatest fi ction writers.
AUTHOR: G. WILLIAM FREEMAN, Ed.D.
Dr. Freeman is a sixth generation descendant of Captain Nichols. The echo of Nichols
lineage and the stories of his bravery have remained with Dr. Freeman throughout his
life, propelling him to conduct considerable research on the history of his ancestor.
Dr. Freeman has had a long professional career. He holds graduate degrees from
Harvard and Boston Universities and was a General Motors Scholar at the University
of Denver. He enjoys coin collecting, woodworking projects, playing the piano and
genealogical research." />
