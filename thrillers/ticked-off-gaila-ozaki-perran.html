  <title>Ticked Off! - Gaila Ozaki Perran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=Section1&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;It looks like a murder that
couldnt have happened. &lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Frank Caponelli
(a/k/a Monsieur Francois), owner of a downtown beauty salon in fashionable
Westport, Connecticut, is found dead in his apartment, with a knife wound in
his back.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The knife, wiped clean, is on
the table beside him.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Every door and
window is locked from the inside and there are no fingerprints anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Baffled, police Lieutenant Phelan
turns to Professor Sanford, head of the psychology department at Fairfield
University.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The professor and David
Trent, his young assistant, agree to aid in the investigation.&lt;span
style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;David, who has a definite weakness for female
charm, is not at all reluctant, for it develops that many beautiful women have
figured in the life of Frank Caponelli.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;Charcoal sketches of them line the walls of his apartment, all nudes,
and all drawn by Frank, who had been an amorous esthete with a taste and talent
for art.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The investigation reveals that
his affairs had been numerous as well as overlapping  and most of them with
patrons of his salon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;Professor Sanford feels that all
of these women are suspects and David is given the not unwelcome assignment of
tracing and interviewing them.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The manner
in which he accomplishes this, and the tangled chain of events he uncovers,
provides an amusing and exciting background for the plot.&lt;span
style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;There are other murders, and conflicting
clues, but finally the evidence gathered by David enables the professor to
arrive at the solution through clever psychological deduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;u&gt;TICKED OFF!&lt;/u&gt;, by Gaila
Ozaki Perran, is based on the book &lt;u&gt;THE CUCKOO CLOCK&lt;/u&gt;, written by her
father Milton K. Ozaki, in 1946.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal style=&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;The murder and consequential activity
surrounding this creative mystery story, has been modernized and injected into Westports
downtown business area.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Ms. Perran has
used the names of actual people and places of business wherever permitted.&lt;/p&gt;
