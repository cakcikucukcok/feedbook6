  <title>The Wind - Eric Carasella</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Anthony Morrison has found his dream house and is eager to introduce his wife, Jeannette, and children, Taylor and Michael, to his discovery. Its as if the house is drawing him in, like a wind that pushes you a little faster along your walk in the woods.&lt;p&gt; 
Little does Anthony know that realtor Richard LeBrock is desperate to sell the house. The previous owners lived there just two short weeks, leaving in a mysterious rush without explanation. Harriet Cray, the only other homeowner on Mercy Street, is eager to have the house occupied as well. For Harriet, having children nearby will continue to feed her obsession.&lt;p&gt; 
After settling in, each family member begins to experience disturbing events. Laughing children, a weeping mother, and unspeakable apparitions of abuse. Jeannette and the children vacate quickly, but Anthony cannot make himself leave. He is driven to discover what happened in the house and how the odd Harriett Cray is involved.&lt;p&gt; 
Piecing together the mystery becomes Anthonys ultimate nightmare. As each bit of information falls into place, Anthony finds hes become the very man he swore he never would. At what point did all that he love become second to finding answers?" />
