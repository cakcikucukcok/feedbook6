          &lt;strong&gt;THEY NEEDED TO GET THEIR HANDS ON A KILLER AND KEEP THEM OFF EACH OTHER&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Denver cop Mike Lawson had faced his share of adversity, but so had PPS tech whiz Cassie Allen. So when he was hired as her personal bodyguard while she decoded a mysterious computer disk, the last thing they needed to do was to act on their attraction. As Cassie closed in on deciphering the secrets someone was desperate to protect, the attempts on her life increased. Suddenly, no amount of safeguarding seemed enough to keep the auburn-haired beauty out of the line of fire. Mike&#39;s past was fi lled with people he&#39;d loved and lost. He&#39;d do whatever it took to keep his special assignment off that list….&lt;/p&gt;
