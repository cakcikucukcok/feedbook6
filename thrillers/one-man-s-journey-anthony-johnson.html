  <title>One Man’S Journey - Anthony Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Terrance End Zone Jackson is born smart and hard working in Philadelphia. With the God fearing values and work ethic set forth by his parents, he ventures out into the world to make his way. He becomes an exceptional student, athlete, and teacher, but some trouble with the law and in his childhood neighborhood starts him on a path to nowhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before hitting rock bottom, though, Terrance finds purpose in his work as a New York State Parole Officer. In the line of duty, he meets Sherry Buchwalta fellow officer with a long track record of success. A wife and mother, Sherry reminds Terrance of his college sweetheart, Mary, due to her no-nonsense, fearless attitude and stalwart reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When they meet, Sherry is on an obsessive hunt for one evil man in particular, and Terrance is glad to help. When Sherry is murdered by the very man she hunts, Terrances motivations change. No longer is he seeking justice but revenge. But does Terrance have it in him to murder another human being or will he follow the line of the law?&lt;/p&gt;" />
