  <title>You the Jury - Gini Graham Scott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Can a person repress memories of childhood sexual abuse and suddenly &quot;recover&quot; those memories 10, 15, or 20 years later? &lt;I&gt;YOU THE JURY&lt;/I&gt; offers a balanced approach in which you will hear arguments on both sides of the question in a representative case argued by opposing attorneys. It&#39;s a fast-paced legal drama that takes place both inside and outside the courtroom, when the plaintiff, 27-year old Roberta Claire, decides to file a lawsuit charging sexual abuse by the defendant, her 66-year old stepfather, Lloyd Adams. Although the alleged incidents occurred more that fifteen year ago, Roberta is convinced they actually happened, while Lloyd insists he is innocent and that Roberta&#39;s psychologist planted the awful memories in his step-daughter&#39;s mind. When the case goes to trial, you&#39;ll be invited to participate in the decision-making process as a voting member of the jury. So are the memories of abuse real and do you find for the plaintiff? Or do you reject the theory of recovered memories as &quot;junk science&quot; and find for defendant? You decide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;This book is unique among the many books about &#39;recovered memories&#39; because it presents both sides of the issue. Readers will get to &#39;see&#39; what really happens in a trial-and the reader is a juror. Which witnesses should be believed is up to the reader. It is a realistic challenge.&quot;-Robert Koscielney, Member/Board of Directors, False Memory Syndrome Foundation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;I&gt;You the Jury&lt;/I&gt; is a riveting and fascinating book and shows the human element of the destruction and devastation of family members. It shows professional therapists with their conflicting opinions on this controversial issue. Written in fiction-like form, &lt;I&gt;You the Jury&lt;/i&gt; is magnetic in holding your attention to an issue and tragedy that is all too endemic in our society.&quot;-Claire R. Reeves, President/Founder, Mothers Against Sexual Abuse, MASA" />
