  <title>Dutch Point - Kareem R. Muhammad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Haunted from his past and battling his inner demons, social worker Andrew Edwards goes back to work at the Department of Children and Families while still reeling from the death of his wife, Kay. His return may be premature, though, as he grapples with trauma and suicidal urges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The caseload at DCF in Hartford, Connecticut, never decreases. Each day, Edwards and his co-workers face a litany of new clients involving instances of substance abuse, child abuse and neglect, and heroin-exposed newborns. In this stress-filled job, many of the cases originate in the Dutch Point Housing Project, where illegal drug activity and crime reign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Edwards does his best to protect, educate, and preserve families, there is an underlying evil at workand someone is protecting a powerful secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sergeant, we have two down: one critical and one fatal. We also have the shooter in custody, the female voice says, now much closer than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You ID this guy? the woman asks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I try to open my mouth to let them know he ran inside the apartment to the girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name on the badge is Andrew Edwards, DCF Hartford, one of the voices says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thats me! Whats going on? Hey? Hey?&lt;/p&gt;" />
