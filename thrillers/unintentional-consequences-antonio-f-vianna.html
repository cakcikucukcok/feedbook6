&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 10pt&quot;&gt;Rand Bauge never thought he was simply working for wages when he was employed by the U. S. Government, although there were enough situations that would contradict that notion. He got things done any way he could; usually it was his way. No one seemed to care about the means that he used. Questions were rarely asked. Only the results mattered. He and his boss saw eye to eye on their relationship because it worked well for a good long time. Things are now different. He&#39;s on his own, retirement urged upon him against his wishes. The panic call he got from his second wife threw him for a loop ... something bad had gone wrong at home. He&#39;s got to get there fast before it is too late. However, along the way, unintended surprises block his advancement. Who&#39;s really out to get him? This might be his biggest test ever ... will he make it through the ordeal?&lt;/P&gt;
