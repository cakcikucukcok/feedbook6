Determined to crack the crime operation, Bamford will stop at nothing until he finally leads police to a fish marketand what he hopes are the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this gripping tale, an Idaho rancher attempting to solve his parents murder uncovers a major drug operation in Seattle where only time will tell if he finds the justice he so desperately needs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
