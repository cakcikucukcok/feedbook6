  <title>Blood on the Ballot - William J. Dahms</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Forty-four-year-old Colonel Tim Delaney is about to retire from the U.S. Army after five wars and twenty-six years of service. When his niece&#39;s boyfriend, journalist Michael Scott, turns up dead after investigating the fatal plane crash of a wealthy and prominent senator-whose widow is now married to the leading candidate for president of the United States-Delaney is suddenly and unexpectedly drawn into a series of deadly events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Delaney soon discovers a pervasive conspiracy is responsible for multiple murders and the subversion of the U.S. justice system. Rich, powerful, and highly influential individuals are determined to protect a dark secret. Exposure could derail the ambitions of their handpicked presidential candidate and thwart the drive for power and wealth of one of the world&#39;s richest men. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conspirators are willing to use any method to silence Delaney and ensure that he can do them no further harm. But when they start threatening his family, Delaney knows it&#39;s time to take a stand to protect the lives of those he loves and start the wheels of justice turning. Packed with thrilling action and deadly secrets, &lt;I&gt;Blood on the Ballot&lt;/I&gt; is a tantalizing glimpse into the seedy underworld of American politics.&lt;/p&gt;" />
