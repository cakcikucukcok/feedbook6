  <title>Devil&#39;s Harbor - Alex Gilly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With heart-stopping thrills, a Walter White-esque villain, and a fascinating hero, Alex Gilly&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Devil&#39;s Harbor&lt;/i&gt; is a thriller unlike any you have read before&lt;br&gt;Nick Finn and his partner and brother-in-law, Diego Jimenez, are used to rough water. As Marine Interdiction Agents for Customs and Border Protection, the two hunt drug smugglers, human traffickers, and other criminals who hide in the vastness of the waters surrounding southern California.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One night, Finn and Diego track a phantom boat off the Los Angeles coast, but it disappears before they can intercept it. They find a dead body in its wake, ravaged by sharks. Their investigation into the floater stalls when Finn is accused of using excessive force following the death of a suspected drug smuggler. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Diego is murdered--and Finn is the number-one suspect. As he races to find the real killer and save his marriage, Finn is forced to partner with Linda Blake, the desperate captain of the &lt;i&gt;Pacific Belle&lt;/i&gt; and mother of  Lucy, a very sick little girl, to attempt the one thing he has devoted his life to stopping. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to clear his name and save a child&#39;s life, Finn must smuggle narcotics by sea into the United States...and avoid the net that his CBP colleagues have cast for him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
