People have always told Dawn she&amp;#8217;s beautiful, and she just hopes they don&amp;#8217;t see beneath&amp;#8212;to how she grew up, to what she&amp;#8217;s always tried to outrun. She revels in her getaways with her perfect (maybe too perfect) husband, the occasional long weekend in luxurious homes, temporarily inhabiting other people&amp;#8217;s privileged lives. Miranda&amp;#8217;s email strikes a nerve, with its lying intimation that Dawn is so dirty you need to throw out her sheets.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beware of your &amp;#8220;host&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wouldn&amp;#8217;t have left a review at all, if I didn&amp;#8217;t feel it was my civic duty to warn others&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;57-year-old Miranda thought she&amp;#8217;d seen it all, but she can&amp;#8217;t believe her eyes when she reads Dawn&amp;#8217;s review. She&amp;#8217;s a doctor&amp;#8217;s wife but she needs that rental money, desperately. People might think her life is privileged, but they don&amp;#8217;t know what&amp;#8217;s really going on. They don&amp;#8217;t know about her son. She won&amp;#8217;t take this threat to her livelihood&amp;#8212;to her very life&amp;#8212;lying down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two very different women with this in common: Each harbors her own secret, her own reason why she can&amp;#8217;t just let this go. Neither can yield, not before they&amp;#8217;ve dredged up all that&amp;#8217;s hidden, even if it has the power to shatter all they&amp;#8217;ve built.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is not over.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is &lt;u&gt;so&lt;/u&gt; not over.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
