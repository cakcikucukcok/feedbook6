  <title>The Bodyguard&#39;s Baby (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Debra Webb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;HE&#39;D BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GIVE HIS LIFE TO PROTECT HERS.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s what it had almost cost bodyguard Nick Foster. Laura Proctor was more than a job to Nick–and they had unfinished business. For two years Laura was suspected dead. Nick hadn&#39;t believed it. But he also &lt;em&gt;couldn&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; believe she&#39;d had a baby in that time…with anyone else but him. Laura would trust Nick with her life, but not with her secret. And she wouldn&#39;t go back to Jackson, Mississippi, with him and leave her child in the hands of a kidnapper. Somehow she had to convince Nick that her baby was missing, but that the child &lt;em&gt;wasn&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; his. Because the closer he got to the truth, the more danger would come to them all.&lt;/p&gt;
