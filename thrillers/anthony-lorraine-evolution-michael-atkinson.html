      <meta name="description" content="Anthony, on his way from basketball practice with his team mates, is left alone as usual. Not
that he minds, he loves his esoteric world. Not tonight, though.
He hears sounds emanating from one of Brooklyns sordid alleys, and with nothing better to
do, he foolishly goes in to investigate. Now Anthony fi nds himself a witness to . . . He later
fi nds out that the victim is an important man, from Washington. The icing on the cake, is
that the man he saw committing the violent crime in the alley, is now looking for him, and
wants him to be his next victim/trophy.
Everyone is in the loop, but not Lorraine. What scares her the most, is that Anthony, her
friend from childhood, is acting weird, and looking even worse.
An ex-convict, and the nephew of the President of the US of A, Ed is now relishing his new
life as a member of the NYPD. His hedonistic mission in life has now changed course, and
Ed reluctantly has to use the little police prowess he has to fi nd the witness to his crime.

stars, have to endure the vile and grime that" />
