  <title>Heaven is High - Kate Wilhelm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Barbara Holloway is a low-key attorney in Eugene, Oregon who left her father&#39;s high powered firm to handle small legal problems for local residents and ponder her own next move. But while trying to sort out her own future, two people, desperate for help, show up on her doorstep: former pro football player Martin Owens and his wife Binnie. Binnie, who is mute, met her husband when she snuck aboard his boat while it was docked in Haiti and smuggled herself into the U. S. Now Immigration is seeking to deport her back to Haiti, which would be a death sentence. Born to a woman from Belize who was kidnapped and enslaved by pirates, Binnie&#39;s only hope is to prove her and her mother&#39;s real identity. With only days to find the truth and protect Binnie, Holloway sets off for Belize. But what she knows is only the tip of the iceberg in what turns out to be one of her most complex, compelling and dangerous cases yet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
