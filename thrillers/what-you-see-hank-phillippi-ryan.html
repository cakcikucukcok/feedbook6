  <title>What You See - Hank Phillippi Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What You See: &lt;/i&gt;another thrilling installment in Hank Phillippi Ryan&#39;s award-winning Jane Ryland mystery series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would a father abduct his own child? A wedding is planned in Jane Ryland&#39;s family, but there&#39;s a disaster instead. Nine-year-old Gracie-supposed to be the flower girl-has been taken by her stepdad. Where are they? Is the girl in danger? Reporter Jane Ryland learns there&#39;s a limit to the bonds of family-and learns to her peril what happens when loved ones are pushed too far. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Detective Jake Brogan&#39;s got a doozy of a case. At Boston&#39;s historic Faneuil Hall, a man is stabbed to death in front of a crowd of tourists snapping photos of the murder on their cell phones. Solving the case should be easy, but the pictures and surveillance video lead him to a dark conspiracy of extortion and stolen lives. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jane and Jake must explore where their loyalties lie-to each other? To their families? To their careers? If they make the wrong decision, the consequences could be fatal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
