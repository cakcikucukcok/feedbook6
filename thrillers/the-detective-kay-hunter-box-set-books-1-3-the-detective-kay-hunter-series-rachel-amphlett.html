Here&amp;#39;s what you get in the box set:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Scared to Death&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the body of a snatched schoolgirl is found in an abandoned biosciences building, the case is first treated as a kidnapping gone wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But Detective Kay Hunter isn&amp;rsquo;t convinced, especially when a man is found dead with the ransom money still in his possession.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When a second schoolgirl is taken, Kay&amp;rsquo;s worst fears are realised.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With her career in jeopardy and desperate to conceal a disturbing secret, Kay&amp;rsquo;s hunt for the killer becomes a race against time before he claims another life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For the killer, the game has only just begun&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Will to Live&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When a packed commuter train runs over a body on a stretch of track known to locals as &amp;lsquo;Suicide Mile&amp;rsquo;, it soon transpires that the man was a victim of a calculated murder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As the investigation evolves and a pattern of murders is uncovered, Detective Sergeant Kay Hunter realises the railway&amp;rsquo;s recent reputation may be the work of a brutal serial killer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With a backlog of cold cases to investigate and attempting to uncover who is behind a professional vendetta against her, Kay must keep one step ahead of both the killer and her own adversaries.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When a second murder takes place within a week of the first, she realises the killer&amp;rsquo;s timetable has changed, and she&amp;rsquo;s running out of time to stop him&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;One to Watch&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sophie Whittaker shared a terrifying secret. Hours later, she was dead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Detective Kay Hunter and her colleagues are shocked by the vicious murder of a teenage girl at a private party in the Kentish countryside.&lt;br /&gt;
A tangled web of dark secrets is exposed as twisted motives point to a history of greed and corruption within the tight-knit community.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Confronted by a growing number of suspects and her own enemies who are waging a vendetta against her, Kay makes a shocking discovery that will make her question her trust in everyone she knows.&lt;br /&gt;
