  <title>A Softman - Roman S!delnik, Mara Brewer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="2070. Only some decades ago the human brain used a small portion of its potentialities at the most. But now, thanks to the Intellectum, a bio-chip developed by the Bio-Soft corporation, people have learned to use the potentialities of the human brain and body to full extent. 
But it all happens to be not so easy and safe In the united government of the planet Earth there will always be people vested with power who abuse it for mercenary ends. And the program of the forced bio-chip implantation of the population not only increases the possibilities to exercise the total control over each of us, but also allows to reprogram any persons mind or even to nullify your intellectum as far as the fatal outcome. 
Alto Marini, a senior guard of the cyberjail built for custody and virtual tortures of the violators of the political regime, has already been for eight years solving the mystery of disappearance of his elder brother, the creator of the Intellectum. But as soon as Alto seems to approach the answer, the life and the social status of Alto himself change drastically" />
