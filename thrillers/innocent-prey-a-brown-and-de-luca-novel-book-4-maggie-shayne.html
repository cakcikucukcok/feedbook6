  <title>Innocent Prey (A Brown and de Luca Novel, Book 4) - Maggie Shayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;To save innocent lives, they&#39;ll have to risk their own.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Self-help superstar Rachel de Luca and Detective Mason Brown have finally given in to their overwhelming attraction to each other, but neither of them is ready to let physical passion turn into full-blown romance, so they carefully maintain an emotional distance. Then a judge&#39;s daughter disappears, and Mason has a terrible sense that it&#39;s connected to the most recent case they solved together: the abduction of Rachel&#39;s assistant.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The discovery of a string of missing women - all young, all troubled - seems like a promising lead. But there&#39;s no clear connection between the missing girls and the high-profile young woman Mason is trying to find. He realizes that once again he&#39;ll have to rely on his own well-honed instincts and Rachel&#39;s uncanny capacity to see through people&#39;s lies in order to catch a predator and rescue his captives. But can they do it before Rachel becomes his next victim?&lt;/p&gt;
