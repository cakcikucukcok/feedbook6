  <title>Rembrandt Redux - Hugo Uyttenhove</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The story begins in 1647 when Rembrandt is at the height of his career and follows a fictional account of one painting to the present when art dealer Tom Ardens buys it at a tag sale. He thinks its a Rembrandt and wants to sell it as soon as possible to solve his financial problems. During the week of the authentication process, the infamous German criminal Fritz Schroller thwarts his plan. Tom gets help from ex-detective Marco Vincente to battle Schroller as the origin of the painting is questioned and Tom&#39;s windfall is jeopardized.
What people have said about the author&#39;s books:
&quot;Uyttenhove&#39;s writing style is similar to the interpretation of art itself: varied and personal, yet unifying and global, all in one fell swoop. A study of arts role in society and how its apprized historically, culturally and individually, Uyttenhove&#39;s book is essentially an examination of how people across the globe, and from all walks of life, are willing to risk their lives for art.&quot; Omar Figueras, The US Review of Books
&quot;What I liked best about this fiction story is the balance between intellect, emotion and action. The story is well informed about art, the business of art and the operation of art museums internationally. It gave me new reasons to care about art and admire professionals in various occupations related to the business side of art. At the same time, there was danger and suspense throughout, giving me that edge of the seat feeling. &quot; Citizen John, Amazon.com" />
