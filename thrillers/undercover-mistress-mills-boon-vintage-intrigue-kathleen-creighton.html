  <title>Undercover Mistress (Mills &amp; Boon Vintage Intrigue) - Kathleen Creighton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Exiled soap star Celia Cross had taken a lot of diverse parts in her life, but when she rescued a clinging-to-life man off the Malibu shore, she also found the role of a lifetime. Because said man was in fact a federal agent who had uncovered a deadly plot.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And for once, &quot;dippy&quot; Celia was in a position to do some good. If only she could convince the rapidly recovering Roy Starr to cast her as his partner….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That was something lone wolf Roy was extremely reluctant to do. His hesitations were twofold: one, the last thing he wanted to do was put his beautiful blond benefactor in danger. And two, when the play-acting was over, would he be tempted to turn this bit of stunt casting into the real thing?&lt;/p&gt;
