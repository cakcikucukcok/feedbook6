As the authorities close in, JJ is in a race against time to unravel the mysteries of One Detroit, Inc. As ambition, greed, and revenge collide, it appears no one will survive unscathed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this heart-pounding thriller, a young attorney must do everything in his power to survive the greatest battle of his life as he attempts to destroy an evil enterprise and conquer the demons of his past.&lt;/p&gt;" />
