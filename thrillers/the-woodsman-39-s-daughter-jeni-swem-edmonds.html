  <title>The Woodsman&#39;s Daughter - Jeni Swem Edmonds</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thomas Martin is a pranksterone of those guys who thinks his jokes are funny. Living in the foothills of the Smokey Mountains, he revels in executing pranks on the campers and hikers; he has mastered the art of scaring the city folk. Sometimes his stunts have deadly consequences. He calls himself the Woodsman.
Though loyal to her father, Martins ten-year-old daughter Jennifer is often afraid, especially when Martin abuses her mother, Eileen. Jennifer is with him the day a hiker dies as a result of one of his foolish pranks, bringing the family to a breaking point.
Just a few days before Jennifers eleventh birthday, Martin is brutally murdered. Eileen disappears, and Jennifer has no memory of her fathers tragic death. Time passes, but Jennifer has her never forgotten the abuses her father heaped on the family. She now leads a life full of murder and deceit, getting revenge on those who mistreat women and those who stick their noses in her business. Her mother served revenge up on a platter, but for Jennifer, revenge is spoon-fed and dressed to kill. She is the Woodsmans daughter." />
