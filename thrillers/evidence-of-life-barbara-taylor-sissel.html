  <title>Evidence of Life - Barbara Taylor Sissel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;On the last ordinary day of her life, Abby Bennett feels like the luckiest woman alive.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But everyone knows that luck doesn&#39;t last forever… As her husband, Nick, and daughter, Lindsey, embark on a weekend camping trip to the Texas Hill Country, Abby looks forward to having some quiet time to herself. She braids Lindsey&#39;s hair, reminds Nick to drive safely, and kisses them both good-bye.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For a brief moment, Abby thinks she has it all—a perfect marriage, a perfect life—until a devastating storm rips through the region, and her family vanishes without a trace. When Nick and Lindsey are presumed dead, lost in the raging waters, Abby refuses to give up hope.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Consumed by grief and clinging to her belief that her family is still alive, she sets out to find them. But as disturbing clues begin to surface, Abby realizes that the truth may be far more sinister than she imagined. Soon she finds herself caught in a current of lies that threaten to unhinge her and challenge everything she once believed about her marriage and family.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With a voice that resonates with stunning clarity, Barbara Taylor Sissel delivers a taut and chilling mystery about a mother’s love, a wife’s obsession, and the invisible fractures that can shatter a family.&lt;/p&gt;
