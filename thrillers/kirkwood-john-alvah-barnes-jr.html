  <title>Kirkwood - John Alvah Barnes Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Jay must find the saboteur before someone else dies...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;p&gt;                              &lt;b&gt;Code Blue!&lt;/b&gt; Kirkwood Medical Center electronic technician Jay Barlow knows about Life-and-death emergencies--he just never imagined that he&#39;d be in that situation himself. While checking a defibrillator used to shock human hearts into action, Jay receives a jolt that starts a sinister, dangerous and ultimately fatal series of events.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Jay is recovering and being cared for tenderly by ER nurse, Debbie Farrell, Jay and his boss, Dan Harris, watch as the Biomedical Department is shocked by a series of mysterious and potentially lethal equipment malfunctions. As Jay&#39;s romance with the delectable Debbie grows, he and Dan begin to suspect deliberate sabotage. But why would anyone booby-trap machines designed to save lives?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jay himself becomes a suspect and then watches in horror as a fellow Technician dies in an accident caused by a faulty machine. When the breakdowns are used as an excuse to close down the entire department, Jay decides he must track down the killer before more innocent people are sacrificed. He suspects everyone, including his best friend, before uncovering the ruthless killer. Finally he recruits the entire department in a bizarre, fitting and very satisfying plot of revenge.&lt;p&gt;" />
