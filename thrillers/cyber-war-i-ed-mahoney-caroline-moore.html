  <title>Cyber War I - Ed Mahoney, Caroline Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There is money in cybercrime, yet the stakes are higher in cyberwar, where nation-states battle to cripple their foe&amp;rsquo;s capacity to operate in the information age. &amp;nbsp;In Cyber War I, Iran launches a six-day cyberwar against the West to level the playing field of technology powers.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rob Warner feels he is at the end of his career. &amp;nbsp;He knows he has a great job, but he&amp;#39;s ready to retire. The work isn&amp;#39;t as fun as when he was technical. &amp;nbsp;Reluctantly,&amp;nbsp;Rob&amp;nbsp;finds himself in the middle of the action, and in a position to stop the pending destruction. &amp;nbsp;If he&amp;rsquo;s willing to sacrifice his career, jeopardize his retirement, and put his life in harm&amp;rsquo;s way, then he can lead his team of security analysts and forensics experts&amp;nbsp;to counter-attack and save his country from devolving back to the digital stone age.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Cyber War I marries a high-tech thriller with a primer on computer security in this author&amp;#39;s debut novel. &amp;nbsp;From his vivid description of the raised floor in a data center, to detailing a ransomware attack, Ed interprets this complex world for his readers. &amp;nbsp;His authentic characters display their commitment to protecting technology in a world of bad actors. &amp;nbsp;The attacks are all too real as the technology is disclosed. &amp;nbsp;Cyber attacks are explained, both in the kits used to make them and the methods to recover.&amp;nbsp; The potential for the advanced economies of the world to lose everything appears unstoppable in this avalanche of escalating&amp;nbsp;assaults in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;" />
