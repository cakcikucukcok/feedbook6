  <title>The Blood Red Teardrop - Ilze Berzins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Based on a true-life Colby College sex scandal, The Blood Red Teardrop walks a fine line between fact, fiction, and fantasy.
Izzie Pedersen is a writer. She writes because she must, not because she wants to. Its a tough life: lots of drinking, two hour days, money issues, and killers loitering around, determined to put an end to Izzie and the blockbuster shes hard at work on.
Moving to her new home in Waterville, Maine, with her husband Nick and dog Laachuk, Izzie becomes entangled in a sordid tale which threatens her life and the life of those she loves. Interspersed are her poignant memories of Paris, where she spent part of her youth, and flashbacks to Ottawa, which she doesnt miss for a second. And hanging over her is the specter of a cunning killer who is determined to kill again. 
The Blood Red Teardrop, the latest thriller by prolific mystery writer Ilze Berzins, is an engaging, adventurous, and suspense-filled tale that you wont be able to put down." />
