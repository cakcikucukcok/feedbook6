  <title>Triple Cross - Brian Freemantle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Moscow&#39;s Organized Crime Bureau chief Dimitri Danilov teams up once more with William Cowley, head of the FBI&#39;s Russian desk, their attempt to thwart a unified global mafia makes for Brian Freemantle&#39;s most unique and explosive Danilov/Cowley thriller yet. Their mission: to stop the Mafias of the U.S., Russia, and Italy from forming themselves into an organized crime conglomerate with the power to, quite literally, rule the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their investigation reaches right into the seat of the U.S. government, when the FBI agent nephew of the House Speaker is blown up in a car bombing. And it becomes very personal indeed when it&#39;s proved the Russian capo di tutti i capi was responsible for the murder of Danilov&#39;s lover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But before they can begin to solve the crimes, Danilov and Cowley have to get themselves together-their good cop, bad cop command of a multinational investigation team risks disastrous failure when Danilov decides upon personal, murderous retribution for his lover&#39;s death. Cowley, himself threatened by the exposure of his near alcoholism and with his career on the line, has no choice but to cross his partner and friend and prevent the Russian&#39;s professional suicide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Triple Cross&lt;/i&gt;, Brian Freemantle proves again his mastery of international intrigue and thrills. With double cross after double cross, the mobs stay contemptuously ahead of a pursuit that ventures from America to Moscow to Rome. But will Danilov and Cowley be able to surmount their personal demons and bring the mobsters to justice? They&#39;re on the verge of bringing down international crime when Danilov, both in and out of control, springs the Triple Cross.&lt;/p&gt;" />
