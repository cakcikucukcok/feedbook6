  <title>Let Justice Rain - Edison Carver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The line between justice and the rule of law can get a little fuzzy at times. Juryn Raynes younger brother is almost killed defending his fiance from a vicious rape attack. As Juryn sits in the hospital, watching her brother struggle for life, she makes a vow to rid the world of rapists. She drops out of Special Forces and joins the FBIs Serial Homicide Division, where she learns forensics and other skills to help her fulfill her vow. She leaves the FBI to go to law school, where she learns how to get away with murder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, ten years later, Juryn is a lawyer with a dark secret, a secret she kept hidden during her time at the FBI, a secret she concealed from her law school, a secret that could get her the death sentence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Juryns old team at the FBI has taken an interest in a serial killer who has been killing rapists. No one on the team is aware that Juryn is the killer they are after. Can she protect her secret and continue dispensing the justice she has vowed to bring? Or will she be found out and brought to justice by the very people who were once her friends?&lt;/p&gt;" />
