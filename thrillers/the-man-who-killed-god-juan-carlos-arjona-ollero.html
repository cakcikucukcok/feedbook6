  <title>The Man Who Killed God - Juan Carlos Arjona Ollero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Father, I&#39;m going to kill you in seven days.&quot;
Father Dimitri prepares, as usual, to perform his Sunday duties, but the discovery of an anguishing note and the explosion of an artifact in his church will change everything.
Gabriel, a young amnesiac whose life has been marked by misfortune, is stalked by mysterious individuals who torture his mind. An unexpected chain of events places him in the eye of the hurricane, trapping him between the sadistic revenge of a disturbed mind and serious accusations of terrorism.
Both the priest and the young man are immersed in a mystery where faith and sanity will be taken to the limit by the twisted acts of a murderer.
With the help of Elisa, a prominent psychiatrist, and Halloran, a policeman, Gabriel and Dimitri have seven days to dodge death and, at the same time, decipher the mystery that their minds harbor.&lt;br/&gt;
Deception, symbolism, religion and mystery combine perfectly in one of the most audacious thrillers of the last decade.&lt;br/&gt;" />
