  <title>Lethal Evidence - Jonathan G Rigley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Following an horrific crash landing, Flight 1872 would uncover one of the governments biggest ever kept secrets.
With the &#39;Container&#39; now missing from the burning wreckage, it&#39;s clear it needs to be found and protected at what ever the cost. Who is protecting the &#39;Containers&#39; secret? Could this be a worldwide cover up and a cure to a killer disease?
With such a rare blood group and failing organs, will Nathan be able to save David Benson, the pilot, his mentor, his soul mate? In desperation and acting on impulse, Will Nathan enlist the help of Shiva Lawman, who by anyone&#39;s standards is a gaunt, dark, creepy, cold and calculated killer. What does Shiva do night after night in the secret under ground medical theatre and who are &#39;The Night Men&#39;? Is Shiva Lawman a sinister serial killer? Will Detective Inspector Neil Curtis find him and stop him in time? Will Shiva kill again?
Nathan and Ellie convince Vernon, a simple but extremely clever computer hacker who endeavours to help them both in their desperation to save David and Diana. Will he be able to keep his findings secret and help them for what seems to be the unthinkable, or will he reveal their plan to the authorities?
With time running out and Nathan and Ellie being followed at every turn, Lethal Evidence is an explosive, heart racing, epic adventure, into a dark and mysterious world of murder, medical procedures and government conspiracies. With Nathan and Ellie paying the ultimate price with friendship and love." />
