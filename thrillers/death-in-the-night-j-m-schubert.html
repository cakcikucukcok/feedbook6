  <title>Death in the Night - J.M. Schubert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Taylor Thorn, formally Taylor Simon, finally has all she has ever dreamed of and is living the life of a wife and mother. Although she has wealth beyond anyones imagination, being a wife and mother is all she ever wanted. A friend calls asking for help. The friend is the president of the United States, and he has trouble in the mountains of Colorado. She is the only person who may stop a panic and save the people there. She was able to stop them in Texas. Some people have taken the drug that alters the DNA of a person and causes a metamorphosis into an extremely dangerous killing machine that is hard to stop and harder to kill. How can Taylor, who has everything to lose, take the chance and risk it all to help a friend and save lives at the same time put her own life at risk, stopping these very dangerous creatures? In her quest to stop these monsters, she must face something in her past she doesnt remember because it is too painful. Then she must deal with the betrayal and of her whole life being a lie then and the danger of someone who loves her too much, and that twisted love can ruin her. Taylor must enlist the help of the only people that can possibly save them all, and these people are part monsters themselves." />
