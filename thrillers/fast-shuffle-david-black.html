  <title>Fast Shuffle - David Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An old-school PI is plunged into modern danger and conspiracy in &lt;i&gt;Fast Shuffle, &lt;/i&gt;a gripping mystery from TV screenwriter and producer David Black.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harry Dickinson is a used car salesman living in Springdale, Massachusetts, who believes he is a private detective. His girlfriend, Friday, finds this charming, though she warns him not to get carried away. The local cops are becoming fed up with him. His sister and brother-in-law think he&#39;s unstable and too old for such fantasies. They want him locked up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Harry stumbles upon the case of a missing woman, he decides to investigate. However, the situation is far more complex-and more dangerous-than he imagines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning to the authorities only makes things worse. Harry witnesses a murder, but no one believes him. With Harry and Friday on the run-hunted by the police, the killer, and even Harry&#39;s friends and relatives-their chances for survival look grim. But the man everyone believes is crazy may be the only one who can crack the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
