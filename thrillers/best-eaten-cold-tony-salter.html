  <title>Best Eaten Cold - Tony Salter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine that somebody wants to do you harm. Someone you once knew but have almost forgotten. Now imagine that they are clever, patient and will not stop. They are not interested in causing you physical pain &amp;ndash; nothing so clumsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will get inside your head, they will make you doubt yourself, they will make you question who you are, and they will ensure that everyone you care for starts to doubt you as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each perfectly-orchestrated doubt will combine with its brothers and sisters &amp;ndash; slowly, steadily building to a crescendo and destroying you from within.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now imagine that this is real and it&amp;rsquo;s happening to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Best Eaten Cold is not a story of global conspiracies or nuclear Armageddon. It isn&amp;rsquo;t a tale of massive fraud or national scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a reminder of the delicate balance of our ordinary, daily lives. A balance that can be catastrophically upset by a small number of seemingly trivial incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Above all, it is a reminder of how quickly &amp;ndash; and how blindly &amp;ndash; we have learnt to trust in the online world, despite the somewhat ironic fact that none of us really understand it at all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;_________________________________&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fabiola has just given birth to a son, Sam. She lives an idyllic life in Oxford &amp;ndash; beautiful house, adoring husband, happy healthy baby &amp;ndash; the coming years will be filled with joy and laughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she has a past. A past which she thought she&amp;rsquo;d left behind her. When tiny cracks start to appear in the perfect glass bubble of Fabiola&amp;rsquo;s life, that rosy future becomes blurred and uncertain. Is the past catching up with her, or was it always too good to be true?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Love, obsession, loss and revenge; Best Eaten Cold is both a compelling psychological thriller, and a cautionary tale for our times.&lt;/p&gt;" />
