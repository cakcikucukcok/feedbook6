        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;The nature of the beast…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;That was all DEA agent Carson Turner had thought of since his partner had murdered his family. Then, just as the trail of evidence went cold, his enemy&#39;s beautiful sister, Brenna Lupe, appeared, offering him the chance for more than revenge. She gave him a chance for justice. Brenna felt as if a silver bullet had been launched at her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Until now, she&#39;d always been aware of her brother&#39;s whereabouts. With that gone, she had to make a deal with his sexy former partner. But being around Carson–touching him–brought her untamed side to the surface. With the full moon finally shedding light on their investigation and her brother in their sights, would Carson forgive the deception of a real she-wolf?&lt;/p&gt;
