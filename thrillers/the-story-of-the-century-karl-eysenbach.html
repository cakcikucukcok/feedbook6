  <title>The Story of the Century - Karl Eysenbach</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An Ambitious Science Fiction Novel&lt;br&gt;
Kirkus Discoveries&lt;/p&gt;
&gt;p&gt;Infinitely Zany&lt;br&gt;
Judith Merkle Riley, BOOK OF THE MONTH CLUB AUTHOR, &lt;i&gt;The Oracle Glass&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of the story of the century. Saroyan Pashogi has everythinginternational fame as the world&#39;s most beautiful and glamorous movie star, a Hollywood mansion, and a hunk of a boy friend. But she wants something more. She finds Clem Reader, a New LA celebrity reporter, and they fall into a passionate romance. Little do they know that Clems discovery of the governments darkest, most closely held secret has put both of their lives in peril.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although &lt;i&gt;The Story of the Century&lt;/i&gt; is a science fiction book that has a romantic core, it also provides glimpses of the way things are today in international drug smuggling, the military-industrial complex, intelligence community, and political corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set in a future 300 years after a nuclear war, many things are just the same as they are today. And just as much as &lt;i&gt;The Story of the Century&lt;/i&gt; is about a reporters discovery of what the government really knows about flying saucers and his romance with a Hollywood leading lady, the book is also a dyspeptic portrait of America today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
