  <title>Show No Mercy - Alfred Lewis Bishop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Four ruthless men, one an American and the other three from the Middle East, have devised a scheme, which turns out to be a bloodbath of epic proportions, to extort a monumental sum of money from the United States Government. Nothing short of success will turn them aside. Human lives, seemingly not even that of one of them, have no meaning. Their use of weaponry goes from the most basic to the most sophisticated.&lt;/P&gt;
The story has an aside involving the intrigue one nation will stoop to for some political motive to badger another.&lt;/P&gt;
The story moves from the highest office in Congress, to the office of the President, the FBI, to both the east and west coasts, to other nations, to the Middle East and back and forth. Vividly portrayed is the carnage purely evil and twisted minds can reek.&lt;/P&gt;
There is something in the story for everyone. Seeing into government as it really is from someone with experience. A love story, unbridled violence, that there is a good side to most people. Something for the adventurous among us. Experiencing a father&#39;s anguish, and the vengeful side of him. The story has it all.&lt;/P&gt;" />
