  <title>Afterimage - Jay Brandon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;District Attorney Chris Sinclair has never really forgotten his first real love, Jean, a college girlfriend from the era of free love, a wild young woman who introduced him to a world of sex and drugs and alcohol drastically unlike his own. But she left his life in college and he&#39;s never seen her since, until a young woman is found buried in a shallow grave on the outskirts of San Antonio. Through forensic reconstruction of the decomposed skull, a face takes shape. A detail or two is different, but there&#39;s no doubt the face is Jean&#39;s, like an after image in his mind, he sees her face in the young girl&#39;s and he knows. What he doesn&#39;t know is why Jean wouldn&#39;t have reported her own daughter&#39;s disappearance; the body had been buried for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
