  <title>Confessions of a Slightly Neurotic Hitwoman - JB Lynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Maggie Lee is not your average hitwoman. For one thing, she&#39;s never killed anyone. For another, after hitting her head in the car accident that killed her sister, her new best friend is a talking lizard&amp;#8212;a picky eater, obsessed with &lt;em&gt;Wheel of Fortune&lt;/em&gt;, that only Maggie can hear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maggie, who can barely take care of herself, is desperate to help her injured and orphaned niece get the best medical care possible, so she reluctantly accepts a mobster&#39;s lucrative job offer: major cash to kill his monstrous son-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paired with Patrick Mulligan, a charming murder mentor (who happens to moonlight as a police detective), Maggie stumbles down her new career path, contending with self-doubt, three meddling aunts, a semi-psychic friend predicting her doom, and a day job she hates. Oh, and let&#39;s not forget about Paul Kowalski, the sexy beat cop who could throw her ass in jail if he finds out what she&#39;s up to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training has never been so complicated! And, this time, Maggie has to get the job done. Because if she doesn&#39;t . . . she&#39;s the mob&#39;s next target.&lt;/p&gt;" />
