  <title>River Divided - Hansford Given</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jack ONeal left his uncle Rods sawmill on the New River in Virginia to seek adventure. Travels through the Alleghany Mountains at the beginning of the Civil War and the industrial revolution bring unexpected twists and turns as the conflict deepens. Skirmishes increased between the two conflicting political parties.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Jack had friends on both sides of the New River. The northwest side of the river opposed slavery. The southeast side wanted state rights as slave owners to purchase blacks as property to meet the increasing demand for cotton.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;With changing times, loyalty among friends changes, both in the North and South. Jack finds himself caught up in a sweeping story of passions, hopes, and greed. He quickly learns the part he must play on both sides of the New River.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Thrilling adventures of riding on raging rivers in bateaus and fledging railroads, combined with stunning backgrounds of mountain trails throughout the region, have unexpected twists and turns as the conflict deepens and the country splits. Jack meets exciting action at every turn. He encounters misfits, immigrants, armies, national leaders, and beautiful women who captivate his heart along the way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
