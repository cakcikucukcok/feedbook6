  <title>Gods&#39; Gold - Frank Prete</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;Gods&#39; Gold is a mystery&lt;/B&gt; about the discovery of alternative truths and how the characters chose to deal with those truths. The uncovering of ancient secrets is enlightenment for some, and for others, a reason to commit murder.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In 1902, Egyptologist, Flinders Petrie discovered tons of white ash in the Sinai. Believing the ash to be ancient sacrifices or burnt offerings, he was unable to find traces of charred bones or burn marks on stones or in caves to support his theory. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This begins the mystery of Petries white ash.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Present day Iraq, Sergeant, Mitchell Harrington, an anthropologist in civilian life, is on a reconnaissance mission of a bombed out village. There he discovers buried jugs containing white ash he suspects to be part of Petries original discovery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After smuggling the ash out of Iraq, Harrington rekindles his relationship with Analisa Scotti, an adjunct professor and scientist at the University of Arizona. Analyzing the ash, Analisa determines the strange substance contains mysterious capabilities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Because of its anomalous properties, the ash becomes the obsession of an Arab emir, two brothers who are deserters from the Iraqi Police, an Italian arms dealer, and assassins hired by a Vatican official to destroy its legacy. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those struggling to claim the ash are brought together in a fiery conclusion.  The mystery of Flinders Petries discovery of the ash, along with the ancient secret it possesses, is finally revealed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;The secret of the white ash is so profound, it has the potential to alter history and challenge the long established paradigms of civilization.&lt;/B&gt;" />
