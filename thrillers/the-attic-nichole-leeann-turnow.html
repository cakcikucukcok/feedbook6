  <title>The Attic - Nichole LeeAnn Turnow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;Sometimes when we least expect it, life changes; leaving us dazed and wondering what has happened. Later, we decide that we must have missed something or lost a moment in time. Did life take a leap when we werent watching, or did we simply forget? Is the world keeping something from us or are we keeping something from ourselves? &lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;As Doctor Samuels probes Sarahs mind, she begins putting the pieces together. In the midst of being plagued by flashbacks and blocked memories, she senses that something strange is happening. Sarah is aware that she is depressed and crazy but begins questioning how crazy she really is. While her fears come to life and the shadows of her dreams seep into reality, the true picture awakens inside her mind. No longer does she wonder how she came to be in the mental hospital and no longer does she want to know the truth. Sarah discovers that she is forever a prisoner and may never leave. She is trapped, locked inside The Attic. &lt;/P&gt;
