  <title>Painkiller - Will Staeger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;With page-turning ferocity, Will Staeger delivers a stylistic blend of riveting action, thrilling suspense, and starkly alluring characters in this classic tale of espionage laced with a twist of modern-day terror . . .&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The quasi-retired, Virgin Islands-based CIA operative known only as W. Cooper lives his life free-diving and philandering along a quarter-mile of white sand&amp;#8212;a necessary slice of paradise for a man seeking to kill the pain of torturous memories. His life of leisure is rudely interrupted, however, when he&#39;s tapped by the local police to &quot;dispose&quot; of a bullet-ridden, mysteriously scarred body deposited on the island&#39;s shore by a passing hurricane. Sensing the cops are merely looking to duck the labor of a proper homicide investigation, Cooper declines&amp;#8212;only to encounter a haunting form of d&amp;#233;j&amp;#224; vu that brings with it a strange sense of comradeship with the anonymous victim. Knowing he&#39;d be better off leaving well enough alone, Cooper decides to investigate where no one else seems willing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, junior analyst Julie Laramie discovers, almost by accident, evidence of a massive, clandestine military buildup in China&amp;#8212;and elsewhere. Alerting her superiors in her typically alarmist fashion, she&#39;s reprimanded for violating Agency protocol and told to leave policymaking to the elected officials. Like Cooper, Laramie knows she should walk away, but her gut drives her on a course toward career suicide&amp;#8212;and a bounty of evidence only she seems to see. What she sees? A labyrinthine, untraceable terrorist plot designed to cripple the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led down parallel paths littered with a uniquely dark and compelling cast of enemies&amp;#8212;a zombifying Haitian witch doctor, a slave-trading albino serial killer, and a Creatine-boosted behemoth bodybuilder to name just three&amp;#8212;Cooper and Laramie find themselves drawn together from opposite ends of a terrifying conspiracy. With the clock ticking down, the two realize they may be all that stands in the way of the annihilation of the existing world order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A dynamic and complex story featuring powerful writing, magnetic characters, and a terrifyingly realistic premise, Will Staeger&#39;s debut marks him as the newest star on the thriller horizon. So beware . . . like the Caribbean cocktail with which this book shares its name, &lt;em&gt;Painkiller&lt;/em&gt; is deceptively tasty&amp;#8212;and exceedingly dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;" />
