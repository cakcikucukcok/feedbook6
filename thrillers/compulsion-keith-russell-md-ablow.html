  <title>Compulsion - Keith Russell Md Ablow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Frank Clevenger, a brilliant forensic psychiatrist, is eager to leave the world of the criminally insane behind-until he receives a chilling phone call.  Close friend and former colleague North Anderson, now the Chief of Police on the exclusive island of Nantucket, is desperate for help in solving a shocking case: One of the infant twin daughters of billionaire Darwin Bishop has been murdered in her crib at the family&#39;s estate.  The suspected killer is her adopted brother Billy, and investigators believe that the fugitive teenager has targeted the surviving twin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Clevenger maps the Bishop family&#39;s psychological layers he uncovers some disturbing revelations that lead him to believe Billy may be innocent.  The Bishops are a deeply troubled family.  As charming as he is ambitious and cruel, Darwin seems determined to protect his son-but is he actually trying to railroad him?  Why does Garret, Bishop&#39;s other son, despise his father so intensely?  Is beautiful Julia Bishop a mother grieving for her murdered child or a manipulative seductress with a dark secret to hide?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Clevenger fights to protect the innocent and hunt down the guilty, aspects of the case begin to collide with demons from his own past.  After a life-threatening attack the forensic psychiatrist knows he must penetrate the killer&#39;s psychosis in order to identify him before the Bishop family-and Clevenger himself-become the next victims.  Using his mastery of psychiatry, Clevenger lays a trap to reveal the murderer in an unforgettable finale.&lt;/p&gt;" />
