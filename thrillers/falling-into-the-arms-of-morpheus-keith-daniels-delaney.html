  <title>Falling into the Arms of Morpheus - Keith Daniels Delaney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Besides hit records and sold-out concerts, some people in the rock music game use a another way to make a killing in the business: murder.
A popular headliner, Violette Trend, is led by a one-time runaway Marie Lindeaux, who delights concert goers with her amazing talents at packed stadiums everywhere. One of the bands silent partners, Kevy Stokes, is a corrupt underground drug operator who sends his big guns after a successful rock journalist, Sagan Hunter, whose claim to fame was writing a spin article that put the band on the map but who is now drinking heavily. Sagan is coerced by a federal agent to be used as bait in a trap set for Kevy Stokes before the evil silent partner uses murder to get ahead of the game.
Next on his hit list is the captivating starlet herself, Marie. Kevy figures if he can get her killed, the flood of headlines will create enough uproar to take the spotlight off of him. Sagan, whos fallen in love with Marie, tries to keep her out of Kevys reach, but she slips away. After learning of Kevys evil plan that is already in place for the girls murder, Sagan runs from both sides of the law to try and save her." />
