  <title>Kiss the Bullet - Catherine Deveney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;Could you fall in love with the man who killed your family?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is eighteen years since Danni&#39;s husband and three-year-old son were killed by an IRA bomb in central Glasgow, and she still can&#39;t move on from the tragedy that has blighted her life. As a fresh wave of violence sweeps through Ireland, she decides she needs revenge.&lt;BR&gt;A journey into the dark heart of the Belfast underworld brings her face to face with the sinister Pearson and his enigmatic, one-time accomplice Johnny. As Danni struggles to hold onto her sense of purpose in a world where the idealist and the psychopath seem indistinguishable, she is drawn into a battle to save the life of Stella, a young prostitute. But who is Johnny and why is he helping her? Did he plant the bomb that killed her family? And most disturbingly, what exactly are her feelings for him?&lt;BR&gt;Fast-paced, emotionally pitch-perfect and with a heart-wrenching ending, Kiss the Bullet is a page-turner as gripping, intelligent and satisfying as they come.&lt;/div&gt;" />
