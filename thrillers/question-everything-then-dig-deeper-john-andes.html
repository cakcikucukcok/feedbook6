Suddenly, he is confronted by a scandal of far reaching consequences within the Bureau, two apparently unrelated police killings three thousand miles apart, and grass roots rallies designed to rile the voting populace against a foreign force. While he attempts to influence the outcome of the scandal investigation, he also digs into a negative political figure from the past. His team focusses on learning who is the driving force behind the rallies, and what they mean to the election. The Bureaus manipulative efforts to bury the scandal, as well as the facts uncovered about the dangerous conspiracy cause Davids emotional and physical well-being to spiral inexorably out of control. Rachel is his rock." />
