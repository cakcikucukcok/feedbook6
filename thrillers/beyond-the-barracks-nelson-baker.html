  <title>Beyond the Barracks - Nelson Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Darryl Jaspers longs to serve his country. With an unrivaled determination, he joins The US Marine Corps and begins boot camp at the infamous Parris Island. Nothing is easy. It could at first be blamed by his reaction to stress and the rigors of training, but on a night that changes everything, something unusual happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearing a platoon practicing drill outside his window in the middle of the night, Jaspers assumes recruit errors were made, and punishment was due. But he never sees a thing. When he begins to discover the origin of these unseen marches by exploring the woods beyond the barracks, he soon realizes there is much more to fear than the drill instructors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The perils of basic training are brutal, but cannot compare to the deadly occurrences that literally shake the grounds and alter reality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
