  <title>Trinity Factor - Sean Flannery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Red Army was entering Berlin. The United States was defeating Japan in the Pacific, island by island. The Second World War was now all but over, so Stalin turned his eyes to what could be his next battleground, the heartland of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep in the desert of New Mexico the first atomic bomb was exploding, at a site code-named Trinity. With this bomb, the Soviet Union would never stand a chance against the might of America. Exhausted from the long war against the Germans, a war the Red Army fought largely alone on the continent of Europe until D-Day in June 1944, Stalin sends in his best men to find out what the American scientists are up to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wreckage of a German U-Boat found off of Cape Cod is the first false clue left by Alek and Jada as they move across the United States towards Trinity. Alek and Jada, they are lovers, they are killers, they are Soviet spies on a mission.  They will become the &lt;i&gt;Trinity Factor.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
