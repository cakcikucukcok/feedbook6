  <title>Last Dollar in Lubbock - Donovan Tracy, Cynthia Siokos Sheffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Tyson Ross, a radiologist who owes his education to his country, comes home to Texas. The doctors of Memorial Hospital are doing well, but not well enough for some. There is more money to be made, if only they had their own hospital. They don&#39;t trust anyone in town to lead them but Dennis Colliera doctor from one of the old, landed families and, best of all, one of their own. Having tracked terrorists in military intelligence, Ty senses trouble and is appalled by the greed. So are Dr. Mark Russo, considered an outsider by many but like a father to Ty, and Sue Ann McGinley, the lovely but married woman who fascinates Ty more than he can admit.
The doctors need a truckload of money and Collier raises it. Then, after ground is broken, he commits an unspeakable act of betrayal. The money is gone and Collier with it. Many in the town will be ruined. The doctors can&#39;t turn to the local authorities and they all know why.
Determined not to be drawn in and with feelings he cant afford to explore, Ty moves to Dallas, leaving behind the outrage, the rumors and, reluctantly, Sue Ann. Then a series of break-ins occur back in Lubbock. Mark and the citys finest are on a not-so-legal hunt for Collier and the money trail leads to Hollywood. But making the traitor talk without violating the Hippocratic Oath? When a doctor knows not, he shall call in a colleagueone with the Skills of Another." />
