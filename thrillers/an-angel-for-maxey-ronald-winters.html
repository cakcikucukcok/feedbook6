  <title>An Angel for Maxey - Ronald Winters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reese Maxey is a modestly successful industrial market researcher and executive interviewer.
When a new international religion explodes on the world scene with the goal of unifying all faiths into one body, Reese Maxey is recruited to bring his skills to the movement.
But as he becomes more involved in the rapidly expanding worldwide church, he discovers not all is as it seems in the new faith. His discoveries bring to light his own inner spiritual struggles, and more disturbing, he finds there are human forces around him determined to make him and break him. Or kill him.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
From the lofty powers who meet annually in Davos, Switzerland , to the streets and corporate corridors of mid-western cities, and with the backdrop of todays political and business world, comes a thriller of a story about one mans spiritual struggle and the intrigue of spiritual wickedness in high places.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  	 (5 star review)&lt;b&gt; A religiously inspired thriller&lt;/b&gt;, October 9, 2009 &lt;br&gt;
By 	Midwest Book Review
&lt;br&gt;
Religion and business are matters that can sometimes intersect. &quot;An Angel for Maxey&quot; follows one Reese Maxey, a renown marketer. Called on to help push a new worldwide religion, he soon finds that faith backed by business isn&#39;t all it&#39;s cracked up to be and that his pushing of the new faith may cost him his life. But an angel might be there for him yet. &quot;An Angel for Maxey&quot; is a religiously inspired thriller that will entertain as well as empower one&#39;s faith." />
