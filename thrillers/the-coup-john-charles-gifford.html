  <title>The Coup - John Charles Gifford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1980, the world is teetering on the edge of darkness. The president of the Republic of Liberia, Charles Dunbar Cooper, is preparing to sign a treaty with the Soviet Union that will remove the presence of America in West Africa and signal the continued spread of Communism on the continentan event that both American and European intelligence agents are working to prevent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CIA officer Tom Walsh is used to traveling to Monrovia as an undercover journalist who collects sensitive informationbut Walsh knows this trip will be unlike any before. Assigned to an operation with French intelligence agent Yvette Dubois to prevent the Soviet takeover of Liberia, Walsh knows they are under the gun. With just days to organize key members of the Liberian government and army and stop President Cooper from traveling to Moscow, Walsh and Dubois soon find nothing is going as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of their key players is assassinated while another is arrested and charged in a series of ritual murders. During a demonstration in the capital protesting the government crackdown on human rights, both civilians and soldiers are killed. The government foils an attempted coup and then must defend itself against another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the oldest republic and the most stable government on the African continent tumbles headlong into a maelstrom of nightmare and chaos, sucking in everything within its radius, two spies face the mission of their lives, leaving them to wonder if either will make it out alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
