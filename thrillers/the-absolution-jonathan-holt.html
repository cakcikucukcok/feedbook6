But when she learns that the mask is a Masonic &amp;#8220;hoodwink&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;and that the circumstances of the man&amp;#8217;s death are eerily similar to the Masonic punishment for betrayal&amp;#8212;she suspects that her appointment has darker implications.

The first two books: The Abomination and The Abduction were real page-turners and so is The Traitor. Now I first want to gripe about something that has nothing to do with the content of the books.<br /><b><i>The Absolution (The Carnivia Trilogy, #3) by Jonathan Holt</i></b> | When Jonathan Holt first traveled to Venice, he found it shrouded in thick fog and flooded with high water. This experience inspired him to write the Carnivia Trilogy, a series of thrillers based on Italy’s hidden past. The Abomination and The Absolution, the first two books, have now become international bestsellers published in sixteen countries. The second novel in the trilogy was longlisted for a Crime Writers’ Association Steel Dagger Award.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Absolution - Jonathan Holt</a> </h3></p><hr/>
