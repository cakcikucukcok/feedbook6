  <title>Justice - Dan Mahoney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;New York City.  A wealthy businessman meets a violent fate in his elegant, carefully-secured home in Queens. Two drug dealers are murdered in a Brooklyn no-tell motel room.  Several men are found riddled with bullets and nails on a little-traveled road beneath FDR Drive.  And soon thereafter, a church, a synagogue, and a mosque find bags of cash waiting at their doorsteps-all from a vigilante who signs himself &quot;Justice.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NYPD Detective First Grade Brian McKenna and his partner, Cisco Sanchez (the self-described world&#39;s greatest detective), are assigned to find the elusive killer that all of New York City is rooting for, a man of supreme technical skills, physical power, and intelligence, who always seems to know every move the police will make before they make it.  Justice is executing drug dealers, helping the police close unsolved cases, providing those in need with stolen drug money, and creating a nightmare for the police commissioner, the mayor, and the two detectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As McKenna and Sanchez work to try and outsmart the vigilante and discover his next victim, they also must find out who is helping Justice in his quest for revenge.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Justice&lt;/i&gt; showcases fascinating investigative detail, wild action, and Dan Mahoney&#39;s trademark humor in a terrific police thriller.&lt;/p&gt;" />
