  <title>Night Vision - Shawn McConnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After seventeen years on the Seattle Police Force, the personal and professional life of Detective Steven Morris is at the start of a downward spiral. Things are about to get worse as Dane Reese, a commercial fisherman with a very unusual off-season occupation, unwittingly puts himself between a trio of corrupt narcotics detectives and their sought after quarry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reeses actions set in motion a deadly game of cat and mouse. Morris is drawn into a circle of dangerous deception that will force him to walk a thin line between loyalty to his brothers in blue and a desperate need to uncover the truth. He soon decides to take Reese as an unconventional partner, and they attempt to prevent local cops from committing further crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At stake is nothing less than the life of a mysterious young woman, as well as the chance for Morris to resurrect his sagging career. Played out along the lakeshores of Seattle, the deadly game reaches its climax beneath the rusting hulk of the old Gasworks. Will Morris be able to take down these law-breaking lawmen, or will he and Reese be added to the body count?&lt;/p&gt;" />
