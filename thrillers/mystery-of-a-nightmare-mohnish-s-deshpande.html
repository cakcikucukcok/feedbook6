  <title>Mystery of a Nightmare - Mohnish S. Deshpande</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Loretta Costigan, a blind adolescent, had an incredible ability to look into the future and the past in her dreams. One nightmare that she saw has changed everything. It began with a sanguinary war; the elite Democrats for powers and possessions abducted people to sacrifice them during the ghost-calling rituals by beheading or burning them alive. During the years 1905-1910, sorcerers contributed to those wicked acts and widely distributed the knowledge of witchcraft among the ordinary people and ruthless leaders. Their greediness grew day after the other, and a minister called Alfred Lanchester pledged to destroy their community. However, Alfred believed in Loretta&#39;s nightmare that comprised a mystery that would bring him to death.
A journey in the horror of buried mysteries, from the misty woods to the haunted castles, every moment is filled with a breathtaking adventure and thrill." />
