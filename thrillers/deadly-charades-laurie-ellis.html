  <title>Deadly Charades - Laurie Ellis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sophia Harriman owns a successful art gallery in the French Quarter. She&#39;s thinking how good life is while she waits for the stop light to turn green. Suddenly her world is turned upside down when a dead body smashes onto her windshield. As Sophia struggles with the identity of the victim, she&#39;s forced to confront the shady details surrounding her father&#39;s death many years before. With her tattoo-artist renter and her teenage nephew in tow, Sophia sets out to unravel the mystery of the dead man. Along the way, she uncovers an illegal scheme that threatens to bring down the government&#39;s rich and powerful, who stop at nothing to make sure she doesn&#39;t succeed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
With murder nipping at her heels, Sophia runs into treacherous roadblocks at every turn. Her investigation takes her from New Orleans to the hill country of Texas to the Indian reservations of Albuquerque to the posh city of Boca Raton and finally to the halls of justice in Washington D.C.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The suspense is palpable and the stakes are high. The killer is determined to win at any cost. He&#39;s adamant and resourceful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Will Sophia ever find justice for an elusive killer with friends in high places?&lt;/p&gt;" />
