  <title>The Last Dawn - Joe Gannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It is time to die...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1989. It&#39;s been three years since Captain Ajax Montoya cleared the smoke and blood from his last case--and what a three years. The old world order is coming down along with the Berlin Wall, and the Soviet &quot;Evil Empire&quot; is being born to the ash heap of history by its once captive people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a psychiatric hospital in Managua, a near catatonic Ajax missed all that. In 1986, Ajax freed his only remaining friend from a psychotic killer. But his &#39;methods&#39; were such that he was imprisoned in a nut-house for his pains. And for three years his world stood still.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But ghosts don&#39;t know time nor read headlines. So when one of the many phantoms from Ajax&#39;s bloody past shows up, he is rescued from his personal nightmare only to be plunged from one hell into another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;El Salvador in 1989 is in a civil war so vicious, they say even the Grim Reaper needs an escort. But when the parents of Ajax&#39;s old love beg him to go there and save their son--as he did not save their daughter--Ajax is on the next plane. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he&#39;s not alone. Gladys Darío--the lieutenant whose rescue cost Ajax his freedom and his mind--has been stewing in Miami for three years, and she is ready to back his play, even if it costs her own life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now all they have to do is parachute into the hottest war in the Americas and find that one needle of a missing person in a haystack of the disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;" />
