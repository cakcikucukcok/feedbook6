  <title>A Twisted Ladder - Rhodi Hawk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Psychologist Madeleine LeBlanc has spent her whole career trying to determine the cause of her father&#39;s schizophrenia. She always felt that she could unravel its origins and cure the man who left her and her brother, Marc, to practically raise themselves on the Louisiana Bayou. But when Marc takes his own life on a fishing boat in the middle of Bayou Black, Madeleine embarks on a journey into her family history---to a time when the antebellum era was crumbling, and the line between servant and master was starting to fade. And the more she pries the more she reveals her family&#39;s dark past, rife with conjured demons and river magic gone awry. Madeleine&#39;s only hope to save herself is to face the ghosts of the past, the dangers of the present, and the twisted ladder that links them all together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
