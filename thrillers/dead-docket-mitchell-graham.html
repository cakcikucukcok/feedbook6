      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Katherine Adams and John Delaney have settled into a happy, long distance relationship after the murderous events that threw them together in &lt;i&gt;Majestic Descending. &lt;/i&gt;He&#39;s a streetwise ex-NYPD detective turned lawyer. She&#39;s a hotshot Atlanta lawyer who loves New York but thinks that the Southern Peach is quite a bit of all right.

What he discovers about the young woman&#39;s current past is anything but sweet...and the facts surrounding her death suggest that it was anything but accidental. John enlists Katherine to help him discover what really happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Doing so puts Katherine in the path of a killer who will stop at nothing to protect his own past.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />

Gross has written two fantasy series and several mystery novels. Preceding the publication of those novels, Graham ran a fictional writing contest called the "Delmont-Ross Writing Contest".<br /><b><i>Dead Docket by Mitchell Graham - Goodreads</i></b> | One of the things that held my interest was the realistic dialogue and the dry humor. It was easy to relate to these characters and I wish Delaney was cloned!! I am already wishing for Mitchell Graham's next book. I read somewhere that Dead Docket AND Majestic Descending have both been optioned for a movie.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Dead Docket - Mitchell Graham</a> </h3></p><hr/>
