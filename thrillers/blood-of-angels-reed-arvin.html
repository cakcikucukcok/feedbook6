  <title>Blood of Angels - Reed Arvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Reed Arvin&#39;s previous novel, &lt;em&gt;The Last Goodbye&lt;/em&gt;, was &quot;the best thing a thriller can be: suspenseful, intelligent, and well written&quot; (Harlan Coben), and had the critics raving: &lt;em&gt;People&lt;/em&gt; magazine stated, &quot;You&#39;ll be hooked,&quot; and the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; declared it &quot;sultry, devious, adrenaline-boosting suspense.&quot; Now comes a vivid and haunting tale of one man&#39;s search for the truth -- no matter what the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Dennehy, senior prosecutor in Davidson County, Tennessee, doesn&#39;t recognize Nashville anymore: a decade of relentless immigration means cops are learning Spanish, and the DA&#39; s office is looking for Vietnamese translators. Thomas&#39;s latest case is prosecuting Moses Bol, a Sudanese refugee who faces the death penalty for killing a white woman in the Nations, a notorious, racially charged part of town. Bol&#39;s conviction seems certain, until a university professor claims Thomas sent the wrong man to the death chamber in a previous case. The DA&#39; s office is rocked to its core, but within days another blow falls: a beautiful and brilliant anti-death penalty activist mysteriously surfaces as Bol&#39;s alibi, claiming she was with him at the time of the crime. Bol&#39;s case becomes a lightning rod as protesters on all sides converge on Nashville and tensions threaten to explode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Bol&#39;s alibi has her own secrets -- and is terrified of someone working behind the scenes to get what he wants -- even if it means murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Dennehy be able to piece things together before everything he believes about the law, and about justice, is torn apart?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivid with the emotional complexity that has become the hallmark of Reed Arvin&#39;s work, &lt;em&gt;Blood of Angels&lt;/em&gt; is filled with nonstop action, impeccable detail, and unforgettable characters, making this a novel that is impossible to resist.&lt;/p&gt;" />
