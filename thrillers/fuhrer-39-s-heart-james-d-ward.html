  <title>Fuhrer&#39;s Heart - James D. Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Fuhrers Heart: An American Story&quot; is a suspense thriller set in the New Orleans academic world and inspired by the David Duke era in Louisiana politics.  Full of suspicious deaths, action, conspiracies, and sex; the author adds to this tumultuous mix a great dose of racial tension and political intrigue.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The New Orleans Gambit Weekly calls the novel &quot;a quick and engaging read that presents an insight to how racism has endured through the ages.&quot;    According to the Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, &quot;Fuhrers Heart is a courageous, even-handed attempt to remind us that evil still lurks in the most unexpected places and in the most unexpected ways.&quot;  The journal Public Voices says Fuhrers Heart &quot;expands the definition of academic infighting to an entirely new level.&quot;  Novelist Angelia Menchan says it &quot;has all the components for a thrilling, suspenseful story.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One of the main characters is a young and highly ambitious African American named Michael Woods.  His dreams for a better life lure him from the working class lifestyle of his family, former cotton pickers in the rural South.  He graduates from college and upon receiving a PhD, is fiercely recruited by New Orleans prestigious Institute for Public Policy.  Unbeknown to Michael, the liberal leaning Institute has recently been infiltrated by white supremacists portraying themselves as members of the liberal establishment.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
