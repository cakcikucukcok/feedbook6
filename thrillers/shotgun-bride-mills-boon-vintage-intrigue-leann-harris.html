          &lt;strong&gt;SHE WAS A WOMAN IN NEED OF PROTECTION…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;and Matthew &#39;Hawk&#39; Hawkins was the only man who could keep pregnant-with-his-child Renee Girourd safe from the hired killer pursuing her. The rugged lawman promised to guard Renee with his life. Trouble was, his best hope to protect his former flame was to marry her….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Commitment-wary Hawk had vowed never to let any woman break down the protective walls around his heart. Yet sharing close quarters with Renee had him remembering how natural it had felt to held her in his arms, how much she&#39;d touched his soul. And soon Hawk wondered who posed the most danger to him–the killer or his lovely wife?&lt;/p&gt;
