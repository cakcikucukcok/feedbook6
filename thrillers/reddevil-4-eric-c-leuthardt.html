  <title>RedDevil 4 - Eric C. Leuthardt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;RedDevil 4&lt;/i&gt; is spine-tingling techno-thriller based on cutting edge research from surgeon and inventor Eric C. Leuthardt.&lt;br&gt;Renowned neurosurgeon Dr. Hagan Maerici is on the verge of a breakthrough in artificial intelligence that could change the way we think about human consciousness. Obsessed with his job and struggling to save his marriage, Dr. Maerici is forced to put his life&#39;s work on the line when a rash of brutal murders strikes St. Louis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edwin Krantz, an aging, technophobic detective, and his partner, Tara Dezner, are tasked with investigating the horrifying killings. Shockingly, the murders have all been committed by prominent citizens who have no obvious motives or history of violence. Seeking an explanation for the suspects&#39; strange behavior, Krantz and Denzer turn to Dr. Maerici, who believes that the answer lies within the killers&#39; brains themselves. Someone is introducing a glitch into the in-brain computer systems of the suspects--a virus that turns ordinary citizens into murderers. With time running out, this trio of unlikely allies must face a gauntlet of obstacles, both human and A.I., as they attempt to avert disaster.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
