  <title>Something More - Jillian Szweda</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Alexandria Lauren Sinclair, or just Alex. I remember that much. I am eighteen years old. I think I am dead. Yes, I am definitely dead.
Alex Sinclair was a normal teenage girl before she woke up in the afterlife, scared and utterly aloneor at least, she thinks she was normal. At first, she has no recollection of who she is or how she died. She only remembers falling.
Slowly, her memories start coming back to her, one by one. She remembers her dads addiction, her parents divorce, her little brother, her first love. There are good and bad things, but mostly, Alex feels the need to understand her final moments. She needs to understand.
As the memories pile up, it becomes clear to Alex that her death wasnt an accident. She starts to see everything, but all she really wants to know is why she jumped. A gritty and captivating tale of a teenage girls journey through emotional abuse by an addicted parent, depression, sexual assault, and loss. Something More is also a story of self-discovery, perserverance and strength. But these qualities alone cant bring someone back from the dead, or can they? Whats left when someone falls off the edge, may just change the course of destiny." />
