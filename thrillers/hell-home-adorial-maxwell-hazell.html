      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Hell Home&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A very inspiring children&#39;s book about faith, strength and survival. A book fill with emotions and anger, yet very comforting to the hearts of young children and adults who believe in the power of pray. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;A touching story about seven little girls living at an Orphanage under the supervision of a psychotic Matron called Miss Cross. The children were treated horribly and very often were forced to go to bed without food and water. Sarah, a very brave little girl was the self appointed leader for the group, and convinced the others to protest the inhumane living conditions at the Orphanage. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This decision was met with severe punishment by the Matron who ordered the girls to be locked up in the basement cellar. The dirty old basement was reserved for storing broken pieces of furniture, including old beds and garden equipment, besides other unwanted items. It was also used as a haven for rodents and a burial ground for dead animals. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The children remained in the basement for days without food and water, a punishment which they endured on a number of occasions. The staff members at the Orphanage were very afraid of Matron Cross and participated in the bad treatment of the children. This cruel and inhumane situation, along with lack of proper medical attention led to the death of Sandy, who was accidentally burnt and succumbed to her injuries. Nola drowned while trying to escape from the &#39;Hell Home&#39; Orphanage in a boat. Megan&#39;s health deteriorated rapidly from ill treatment and Kate committed suicide while undergoing punishment in the basement.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Reader, see how a courageous little girl name Sarah O&#39;Dell persevered and fought hard despite the prolonged bad treatment from Matron, to transform St. Francis Children&#39;s Home into a home away from home for future children. Also, prepare yourself for the unfortunate demise of Matron Cross. &lt;/P&gt;" />
