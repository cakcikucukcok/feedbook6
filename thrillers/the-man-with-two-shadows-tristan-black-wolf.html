  <title>The Man with Two Shadows - Tristan Black Wolf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br&gt;Have you ever felt uncomfortable in your own skin?
&lt;br&gt;Maybe theres a reason
&lt;br&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Jeremiah Pym is a private detective  not the flashy gun-toting gumshoe of old, but a quiet, respectable shamus of modern day who earns a modest living on domestic intrigues and background checks. After being hired for what should be a routine surveillance job, Jeremiah witnesses a kidnapping, barely escaping with his life. The next day, however, not a trace remains of any kidnapping or anything else that he saw.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;Trying to put the puzzle pieces together leads the detective on a convoluted chase that brings into question everything that hes ever known about himself. With the help of his Native American mentor, Edgard Moon Bear, Jeremiah discovers that the key to the mystery may be found in another world  a world where therianthropes (human/animal hybrids) are the sentient beings, and where hundreds of years of slow change has allowed some of these beings to wield magical powers.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;As Jeremiah learns the secrets of his own past, he comes to learn who and what he is and why his existence is central to the continued survival of two worlds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
