  <title>The Business of Dying - Simon Kernick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a typical cold November night and Detective Sergeant Dennis Milne, a very atypical policeman, waits in the Traveller&#39;s Rest Hotel parking lot for the arrival of three men. Cynical and jaded, Milne earns money on the side by doing what he does best: punishing the bad guys.  But this time he&#39;s been duped.  Instead of blowing away drug dealers, he kills three innocent people, their deaths starting an investigation that sees him and his conscience heading for trouble. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Less than twelve hours later, Milne is out on the streets again.  Eighteen-year-old Miriam Fox has been found dead by Regent&#39;s Canal---her throat slashed. Desperate to find Miriam&#39;s killer, Milne uncovers a web of depravity far more shocking than he could ever have imagined.  Can he evade arrest for his own crimes and solve a case so sickening that it may provide the key to his personal redemption?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clock is ticking and everyone&#39;s watching their backs as a war of morality is fought in the mind of one renegade policeman in &lt;i&gt;Business of Dying&lt;/i&gt;---the gripping first novel by talented young crime writer Simon Kernick.&lt;/p&gt;" />
