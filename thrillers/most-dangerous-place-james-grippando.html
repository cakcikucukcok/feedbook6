  <title>Most Dangerous Place - James Grippando</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defending a woman accused of murdering the man who sexually assaulted her, Miami lawyer Jack Swyteck must uncover where the truth lies between innocence, vengeance, and justice in this spellbinding tale of suspense&amp;#8212;based on shocking true-life events&amp;#8212;from the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author of &lt;em&gt;Gone Again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the FBI, the most dangerous place for a woman between the ages of twenty and thirty is in a relationship with a man. Those statistics become all too personal when Jack Swyteck takes on a new client tied to his past. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It begins at the airport, where Jack is waiting to meet his old high school buddy, Keith Ingraham, a high-powered banker based in Hong Kong, coming to Miami for his young daughter&amp;#8217;s surgery. But their long-awaited reunion is abruptly derailed when the police arrest Keith&amp;#8217;s wife, Isabelle, in the terminal, accusing her of conspiring to kill the man who raped her in college. Jack quickly agrees to represent Isa, but soon discovers that to see justice done, he must separate truth from lies&amp;#8212;an undertaking that proves more complicated than the seasoned attorney expects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspired by an actual case involving a victim of sexual assault sent to prison for the death of her attacker, James Grippando&amp;#8217;s twisty thriller brilliantly explores the fine line between victim and perpetrator, innocence and guilt, and cold-blooded revenge and rightful retribution.&lt;/p&gt;" />
