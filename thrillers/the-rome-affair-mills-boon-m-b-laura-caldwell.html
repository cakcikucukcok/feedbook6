          &lt;strong&gt;It was an affair…to regret.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rachel Blakely&#39;s charmed life is significantly tarnished after her husband Nick&#39;s infidelity, but she wants to give her marriage a second chance. Then a business trip to sun-drenched Rome with her best girlfriend Kit leads to a night of passion with a stranger–a one-night stand meant to signify the end of a painful chapter in her life.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rachel returns home determined to put the past behind her, and at first life seems golden again. Nick is more loving than ever, and following his promotion to senior partner in a prestigious plastic surgery practice, the couple is welcomed into Chicago&#39;s high society, where beautiful people live beautiful lives.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But there is a dark side…one that sends Rachel&#39;s life spiraling into a nightmare. It&#39;s clear everyone is guilty of something. But whose secrets will lead to murder?&lt;/p&gt;
