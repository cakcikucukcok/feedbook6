  <title>Misconception - Avner Hershlag</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If youre tired of legal thrillers written by lawyers, read this amazing medical thriller written by Dr. Avner Hershlag who not only knows his stuff, but also knows how to write. Combining a little science fiction with a lot of science fact, Hershlag takes us on a scary journey through the fields of genetics and into the near future. Misconception delves deeply into a subject no less important than the mystery of life itself.&lt;p&gt;
Nelson DeMille, author of The Gold Coast&lt;p&gt;
When Dr. Anya Krim, the First Ladys fertility specialist, delivers a grossly deformed baby of undetermined sex, she tries to figure out how the child was conceived. But, before she is able to determine the babys origin, she diagnoses a pregnancy in Megan, a Senators daughter, who has been in a coma for two years. The question of who has impregnated Megan leads to a shocking suspicion based upon the FBIs DNA fingerprinting results.&lt;p&gt;
At the same time, the First Ladys last-ditch attempt to have a child runs amok when the safety of her embryos is threatened. Anya not only has to secure the embryos she created. She must now prove that no one has altered them genetically.&lt;p&gt;
Anya, herself, is desperate to have a child of her own, but her fears of having sex threaten to leave her childless. How far will she go to have a child? Unforeseen complications threaten her reputation, her career, and ultimately, her life.&lt;p&gt;
Misconception takes the reader on a heart pounding and mysterious, yet intriguing journey, examining new reproductive and genetic technologies through Anyas eyes. Along the way, she must grapple with issues of passion and hate, conservative and liberal politics, morality and medicine and ultimately life and death." />
