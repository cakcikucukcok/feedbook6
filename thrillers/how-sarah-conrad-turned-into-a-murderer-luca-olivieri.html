  <title>How Sarah Conrad turned into a murderer - Luca Olivieri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sarah Conrad is a young woman who followed the illusion of a great love to the point of moving to a foreign country. Despite her feelings and her sacrifices, Sarah sees all her hopes and expectations getting shattered and finds herself fighting the confusion and the lack of meaning her life has taken on. When her existential emptiness peaks, Sarah deliberately decides to disappear to think about her future and to realize what she really wants. Hiding in a small hotel in the city center, she spends her days dragging herself from one hour to the other, from one cigarette to the other.&lt;br /&gt;
Sarah&amp;rsquo;s bitter and lonely situation drastically changes when a mysterious man in black, who seems to have such a powerful affinity with the young woman to the point of being able to read her mind, comes into her life.&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s easy for Sarah to see in him the perfect embodiment of that ideal love that, until that moment, had seemed unreachable to her." />
