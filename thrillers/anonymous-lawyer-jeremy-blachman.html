  <title>Anonymous Lawyer - Jeremy Blachman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A wickedly funny debut novel about a high-powered lawyer whose shockingly candid blog about life inside his firm threatens to destroy him&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He&#39;s a hiring partner at one of the world&#39;s largest law firms. Brilliant yet ruthless, he has little patience for associates who leave the office before midnight or steal candy from the bowl on his secretary&#39;s desk. He hates holidays and paralegals. And he&#39;s just started a weblog to tell the world about what life is really like at the top of his profession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meet &lt;i&gt;Anonymous Lawyer&lt;/i&gt;--corner office, granite desk, and a billable rate of $675 an hour. The summer is about to start, and he&#39;s got a new crop of law school interns who will soon sign away their lives for a six-figure salary at the firm. But he&#39;s also got a few problems that require his attention. There&#39;s The Jerk, his bitter rival at the firm, who is determined to do whatever it takes to beat him out for the chairman&#39;s job. There&#39;s Anonymous Wife, who is spending his money as fast as he can make it. And there&#39;s that secret blog he&#39;s writing, which is a perverse bit of fun until he gets an e-mail from someone inside the firm who knows he&#39;s its author.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Written in the form of a blog, &lt;i&gt;Anonymous Lawyer&lt;/i&gt; is a spectacularly entertaining debut that rips away the bland façade of corporate law and offers a telling glimpse inside a frightening world. Hilarious and fiendishly clever, Jeremy Blachman&#39;s tale of a lawyer who lives a lie and posts the truth is sure to be one of the year&#39;s most talked-about novels.&lt;/p&gt;" />
