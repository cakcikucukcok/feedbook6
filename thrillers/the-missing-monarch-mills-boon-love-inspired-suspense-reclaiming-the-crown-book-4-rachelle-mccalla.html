          &lt;strong&gt;ROYALTY IN EXILE &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Six years ago, Crown Prince Thaddeus abandoned his new bride and went into hiding. His motive was to protect his country and his family from a ruthless tyrant. But when his estranged wife tracks him down, Thaddeus knows it’s time to make a stand. Restore the royal line. And reclaim the crown. Yet just as he learns about the family’s new addition—his and Monica’s son—little Peter becomes a target.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In a deadly game of power, Thaddeus must choose between the country and heritage he’s been raised to defend…and the woman he never could forget.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;em&gt;Reclaiming the Crown: Born to rule with faith, honor…and love&lt;/em&gt;
