  <title>Demons  In The  Closet - Maurice A. Butler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rachael Davenport, Janice Johnson, and Monica Smith come together one fateful weekend to attend a national sorority conference, and they forge a bond that will last the rest of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Rachael Davenport, the founder and CEO of a boarding school for foster and homeless children, was born into a world of prostitution and incest. At the age of six, Rachael was given to a religious cult where she was forced into slave labor.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Janice Johnson, a radiation oncologist, was born in a mental institution and passed around the foster care system before being adopted by an abusive woman. Janice ran away and joined the military, only to be caught in the middle of two wars.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Monica Smith, an internationally famous crime scene investigator for the FBI, was sexually assaulted at the age of three and continually assaulted until her senior year in college. She is constantly haunted by nightmares that threaten her emotional well-being and her ability to have normal relationships.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In Demons in the Closet, these three women struggle to cast off the demons of their pasts in order to become productive women in society. Gripping from the start, it is a story of the triumph of the human spirit over the evils of nature and society.&lt;/p&gt;" />
