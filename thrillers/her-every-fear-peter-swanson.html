  <title>Her Every Fear - Peter Swanson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Named a Best Book of 2017 by NPR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The author of the wildly popular &lt;em&gt;The Kind Worth Killing&lt;/em&gt; returns with an electrifying and downright Hitchcockian psychological thriller&amp;#8212;as tantalizing as the cinema classics &lt;em&gt;Rear Window&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wait Until Dark&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;involving a young woman caught in a vise of voyeurism, betrayal, manipulation, and murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The danger isn&amp;#8217;t all in your head . . . &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growing up, Kate Priddy was always a bit neurotic, experiencing momentary bouts of anxiety that exploded into full blown panic attacks after an ex-boyfriend kidnapped her and nearly ended her life. When Corbin Dell, a distant cousin in Boston, suggests the two temporarily swap apartments, Kate, an art student in London, agrees, hoping that time away in a new place will help her overcome the recent wreckage of her life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But soon after her arrival at Corbin&amp;#8217;s grand apartment on Beacon Hill, Kate makes a shocking discovery: his next-door neighbor, a young woman named Audrey Marshall, has been murdered. When the police question her about Corbin, a shaken Kate has few answers, and many questions of her own&amp;#8212;curiosity that intensifies when she meets Alan Cherney, a handsome, quiet tenant who lives across the courtyard, in the apartment facing Audrey&amp;#8217;s. Alan saw Corbin surreptitiously come and go from Audrey&amp;#8217;s place, yet he&amp;#8217;s denied knowing her. Then, Kate runs into a tearful man claiming to be the dead woman&amp;#8217;s old boyfriend, who insists Corbin did the deed the night that he left for London. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When she reaches out to her cousin, he proclaims his innocence and calms her nerves . . . until she comes across disturbing objects hidden in the apartment&amp;#8212;and accidently learns that Corbin is not where he says he is. Could Corbin be a killer? And what about Alan? Kate finds herself drawn to this appealing man who seems so sincere, yet she isn&amp;#8217;t sure. Jetlagged and emotionally unstable, her imagination full of dark images caused by the terror of her past, Kate can barely trust herself . . . So how could she take the chance on a stranger she&amp;#8217;s just met? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the danger Kate imagines isn&amp;#8217;t nearly as twisted and deadly as what&amp;#8217;s about to happen. When her every fear becomes very real. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And much, much closer than she thinks. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told from multiple points of view, &lt;em&gt;Her Every Fear&lt;/em&gt; is a scintillating, edgy novel rich with Peter Swanson&amp;#8217;s chilling insight into the darkest corners of the human psyche and virtuosic skill for plotting that has propelled him to the highest ranks of suspense, in the tradition of such greats as Gillian Flynn, Paula Hawkins, Patricia Highsmith, and James M. Cain.&lt;/p&gt;" />
