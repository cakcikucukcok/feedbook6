  <title>In the Lions Mouth and Other Stories - David Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;B&gt;&lt;/B&gt;B&gt;In this book of short stories I have compiled some of my writing and ideas on a life past and present. Ever wonder what would happen if it started snowing and never stopped...never ever stopped? How would we exist? Where would we live?
Or what about the young soldiers in the Great War who were shot at dawn after a court martial. Have you ever considered the feelings of those who pulled the trigger? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps you are in a sailing boat wondering how a Vikinglong ship has come to be just off the starboard bow. Is it daydream? Well, is it? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or have you noticed police officers on duty, perhaps on television? Ever wondered what they fear? What they carry forever locked inside? Their ghosts? In life there is presumption that we know and understand how others think, feel and fear. Always trying to make the best of circumstances we find ourselves in. I call this the human condition. No matter what that condition, I have found the human spirit always shines through. You just need to know where to look .Life is for living. Stories are for reading. Enjoy. &lt;/p&gt;" />
