  <title>The Unseen: an Invisible Evil - Stevie Reno</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It all starts when three great men are murdered. Society goes into a downward spiral, and all of humanity is left guessing about the existence of true evil. No one wants to acknowledge the existence of Satan or consider that he might be a part of their lives, yet Satan is a very present force on earth. Hes always watching, and the disbelief of people only increases his power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk show host T. Stevens decides to boost her ratings by discussing the notion of good and evil on her program. She does her homework first. She learns all she can about Satan, and she pulls in hundreds of listenerspeople who desperately want to know if the devil has infiltrated their lives. But T. has no idea what she has set in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She soon finds herself surrounded by mystery and deception. She worries she may now be the target of a supernatural battle, and she is right to be concerned. Demons fight for the souls of the living, and evil is winningby a landslide. Is there hope for humanity, or will Satans final victory spell destruction and damnation for all mankind?&lt;/p&gt;" />
