  <title>Dead Man&#39;s Bridge - Robert J. Mrazek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Disgraced former army officer Jake Cantrell and his pal, Bug, a wolf-dog he saved while in Afghanistan and the only friend he has left, try to put their bitter pasts behind them as Jake finds employment at the bottom rung of the campus security ladder of a small upstate New York college. But things only turn for the worse when the college’s richest and most powerful alumnus is found hanging from a campus footbridge on the eve of homecoming weekend.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jake is convinced the man was murdered, but with no honor to his name, no one agrees—at least not until a second body is found hanging from the same bridge. Unable to push aside his military training, Jake and Bug finds themselves working to bring justice to the small college town. But as a vicious hurricane sweeps up the Eastern seaboard and the college’s homecoming weekend rapidly unfolds, the clock is ticking and it’s only a matter of time before the killer strikes again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From award-winning author Robert Mrazek, comes &lt;i&gt;Dead Man’s Bridge&lt;/i&gt;, the first in a new heart-pounding mystery series sure to keep readers hooked until the very last page.&lt;/div&gt;" />
