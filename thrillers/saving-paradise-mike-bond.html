  <title>Saving Paradise - Mike Bond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When a beautiful journalist drowns mysteriously off Waikiki, Special Forces veteran Pono Hawkins, now a well-known surfer and international correspondent for surfing magazines, soon gets embroiled in trying to find out why she died.  What he learns quickly makes him a target for murder or life in prison as a cabal of powerful corporations, foreign killers and crokked politicians places the blame on him.  Haunted by memories of Afghanistan, and determined to protect the Hawaii he loves from dirty politics tied to huge destructive energy developments, Pono turns to Special Forces buddies and his own covert skills to fight his deadly enemies, trying both save himself and find her killers.  Alive with the sights, sounds and history of Hawaii, SAVING PARADISE is also a deeply rich portrait of what Pono calls &quot;the seamy side of paradise,&quot; and an exciting thriller of politics, lies and remorseless murder." />
