  <title>Lone Rider (The Montana Hamiltons, Book 2) - B.J. Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;When danger claims her, rescue comes from the one man she least expects &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A cowgirl at heart, Bo Hamilton does her best thinking in wide-open spaces. So when money goes missing from the family foundation she runs–meaning one of her trusted ragtag employees is a thief–Bo rides into the Crazy Mountains to figure things out. But a killer hiding among the sawtooth ridges takes her captive…and isn&#39;t planning on ever letting her go.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bo&#39;s disappearance gets folks thinking she&#39;s the guilty one run off with the money, but Jace Calder would bet his ranch that she&#39;s innocent. Not that he has any reason to trust the beautiful, spoiled senator&#39;s daughter. But she also gave his troubled sister a job when no one else would. For his sibling&#39;s sake, Jace is going after Bo and bringing her home to face the truth. But up in the mountains, he finds Bo at the mercy of a suspected murderer. As her only hope, Jace is about to find out what they&#39;re both made of.&lt;/p&gt;
