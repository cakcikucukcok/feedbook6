  <title>Girl in the Dark - Marion Pauw, Hester Velmans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An award-winning, internationally bestselling author makes her American debut with this taut, riveting domestic drama with the compulsive intensity of &lt;em&gt;The Good Girl, The Pocket Wife,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Stranger&lt;/em&gt;, about a long-lost brother convicted of a horrifying crime and a sister&amp;#8217;s fight to clear his name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A single mother and lawyer, Iris has a colorful caseload, a young son with behavior issues, and a judgmental mother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also has a brother&amp;#8212;shocking news she uncovers by accident. Why did her mother lie to her for her entire life? Why did she hide the existence of Ray Boelens from her?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Curious about this sibling she has never known, Iris begins to search for long-buried truths. What she discovers surprises&amp;#8212;and horrifies&amp;#8212;her. Her older brother is autistic&amp;#8212;and in prison for brutally murdering his neighbor and her daughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visiting Ray, she meets a man who looks heartbreakingly like her own son. A man who is devoted to his tropical fish and who loves baking bread. A man whose naivet&amp;#233; unnerves her. There is no question that Ray is odd and obsessive, unable to communicate like the rest of us. But is he really a killer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told in the alternative voices of Ray and Iris, &lt;em&gt;Girl in the Dark&lt;/em&gt; is a compulsive, page-turning thriller about lies, murder, and the tenacity of a family determined to stay together even as they are pulled apart at the most vulnerable seams.&lt;/p&gt;" />
