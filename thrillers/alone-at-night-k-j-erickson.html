  <title>Alone at Night - K. J. Erickson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tired of the politics, publicity and endless nights that go with major homicides, Detective Mars Bahr and his partner Nettie Frisch have moved to the Cold Case Unit, which covers the Minneapolis Police Department&#39;s oldest unsolved cases.  One of their first assignments is tackling the murders of rural convenience store employees, which leads them to a sixteen-year-old missing persons case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1986, seventeen-year-old Andrea Bergstad was working alone at night at a rural Minnesota gas station when she vanished without a trace. On the store&#39;s fuzzy security videotape, one minute she&#39;s there, talking on the phone to her best friend, and the next she&#39;s gone.  Now, sixteen years later, Mars goes back to Redstone, Minnesota, to try to put together the pieces of this baffling case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Redstone, Mars meets retired sheriff Sig Sampson, off the job for several years but haunted by the Bergstad case like it was yesterday.  Sig Sampson is the only person who can help Mars do what needs to be done in order to solve it: His memory is the only thing that can take this cold case and make it hot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mars and Sig dive into the investigation, and Mars soon begins to think that their hard work will get them somewhere.  But his concern over the details distracts him from the greater issues in the case, and before he knows it, the lives of the two most important people in Mars&#39; life are at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with her most recent acclaimed novel, &lt;i&gt;The Last Witness,&lt;/i&gt; KJ Erickson delivers a fast-paced, engaging, and surprising thriller.&lt;/p&gt;" />
