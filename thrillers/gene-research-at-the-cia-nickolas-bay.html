  <title>Gene Research at the Cia - Nickolas Bay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gene research at the CIA is an explosive sci-fi thriller where a young doctor named Dr. JANET STEWART is caught up in a top secret government experiment slipping out of control.  Entangled in a web of politics, espionage and terrorism Dr. Stewart is taking the gamble of her life where one wrong move could be her last.  Her discovery of the gene that controls a persons IQ is used in secret experiments in the armed forces, childrens clinics, prisons and at terrorist interrogations at Guantanamo Bay where personality changes are made.
Her success advances her politically to earn a seat on the cabinet of the President of the United States.
Dr. Stewarts association with two neurosurgeons Dr. JOHN STODDARD and Dr. JAMES ROTH lead to the discovery of the C mystery gene.  An amazing observation is made after testing humans indicating this gene is fundamental in their thoughts involving faith and trust. They test an Atheist, Agnostic, dogmatic Catholic and a Muslim. Theories are made on how a suicide bomber constantly reinforces his faith gene to enable him to destroy his own life and that of others.
Finally, the President of the United States decides to use these gene discoveries on thousands of foreign students invited as guests to study democracy and our life styles in the United States to, in effect, make them our secret ambassadors to promote democracy on their return home.
This story illustrates how an innocent humanitarian idea slowly becomes a modern day Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde scenario.  Individual IQs are changed and personalities regress from adult to that of children.  Even the President is enticed by the lure of absolute power through gene control.
The warning is simple; as we follow the path to new genetic discoveries we must be valiant not to surrender our moral and ethical values. 
We have the power and knowledge to create monsters." />
