  <title>Ominous: Borders - Peter Standish Evans</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Set in PARIS, this thriller surges ominously through the psyche of modern Europe. Conflict is rife; danger is everywhere. You will be tempted to trawl through Paris, to drink in the bars, or smoke on dark street corners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warning: Watch your back&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inspector Vasseur has his favourite table on a battered sidewalk. Alone he sits on hot summer nights, allowing his instincts to grapple with the mysterious case of innocent deaths along the River Seine. In other parts of the city, the Stalker trails her female targets, hell-bent on seduction; the Baker clings to his French traditions despite the temptations of the world around him; two beautiful women set up a coffee society &amp;ndash; one leaves the prison of her insular creativity and the other relishes life in all its forms. They bring out the very evil in some, and the pursuit of romance in others. In this tightly plotted novel, borders are stormed, emotional, sexual, and psychotic; and borders weave danger around lovers of coffee, the creative, and the finest of foods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover why author Peter Standish Evans holds a deserved and special place amongst the new breed of thriller writers. Ominous: Borders: Coffee will be a dog-eared and red wine stained addition to your book collection.&lt;/p&gt;" />
