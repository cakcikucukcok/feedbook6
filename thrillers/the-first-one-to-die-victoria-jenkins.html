  <title>The First One to Die - Victoria Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;I was hooked from the start and suffered sleepless nights because I just couldn&#39;t put it down. Brilliant!!&lt;/b&gt;&amp;#x2019; Goodreads reviewer, 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;She tried to break her fall, twisting desperately, but there was nothing to catch hold of, nothing with which she could stop herself. Her single scream cut through the night air.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hot summer night, a young woman falls from a rooftop to her death. &lt;b&gt;Detective Alex King&lt;/b&gt; is called to the quiet terraced street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The victim, &lt;b&gt;Keira North&lt;/b&gt;, was twenty, happy and carefree. It seems like an accident, but there&amp;#x2019;s broken glass on the carpet, and witnesses overheard an argument. Could someone have wanted her dead? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keira&amp;#x2019;s friends don&amp;#x2019;t seem as helpful as Alex would expect and the post-mortem reveals that Keira was hiding a secret: she was five months pregnant. Alex&amp;#x2019;s team &lt;b&gt;soon finds that all of Keira&#39;s closest friends have secrets that someone might kill to keep.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Alex realises Keira might be just the first victim on a list, her leads take her a bit too close to home. With her own demons to fight, can Alex catch the killer, before someone else dies?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The First One to Die&lt;/i&gt; is a heart-stopping and shocking detective thriller that will have you gripped until the very last page. Perfect for fans of Patricia Gibney, Angela Marsons, and Val McDermid.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What readers are saying about &lt;i&gt;The First One to Die&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;This book had big shoes to fill because the first book in the series was so &lt;b&gt;fantastic&lt;/b&gt;. Well it filled those shoes big time it was brilliant, Victoria Jenkins &lt;b&gt;smashed it out of the park&lt;/b&gt;, I loved everything about it. This truly was one of those books that you devour, you can&amp;#x2019;t put it down because every page sucks you in and leaves you breathless and wanting more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now looking forward to book 3 in the series; &lt;b&gt;Victoria Jenkins is now one of my all-time favourite authors.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this book and I give it &lt;b&gt;a big fat 5 stars &amp;#x2013; I loved it!&#39;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;Bonnie&#39;s Book Talk&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#x2018;&lt;b&gt;One of the best crime novels I have read&lt;/b&gt; - and I read many.
