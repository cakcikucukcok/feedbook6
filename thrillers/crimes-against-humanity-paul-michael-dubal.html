  <title>Crimes Against Humanity - Paul Michael Dubal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marisa Dimitrov is desperate to leave her impoverished
village in Bulgaria. When she receives a job offer
from Canada, it appears her opportunity has arrived.
She is soon shocked to discover, however, that she has been sold to a ruthless gang involved with human and drug trafficking. By miraculous chance, the enslaved Marisa is able to get word of her plight home to her father.&lt;/p&gt;
Her father trades everything he has to reach Canada, where he
employs the assistance of washed-up former Toronto drug squad
officer, Dan Huberman. Together, they are able to discover Marisas location, but finding the young woman is only the beginning of their troubles. The gang takes swift and brutal retribution, sending Dan and Marisa on the run for their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
Their only hope is in gathering evidence to implicate the gang
leader, a merciless Chechen warlord, and by doing so diminish
the gangs far-reaching power. Dan soon realizes this case isnt just about Marisa; its also about the ghost of his dead daughter, who died because of his own mistakes. By saving Marisa, he may find peace  but staying alive can be difficult when you dont know who to trust, and the line between loyalty and betrayal is so blurred." />
