  <title>One-Legged Geese - Vincenzo Spiaggi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The super-secret, international anti-terrorist organization known as WI-7, is on a mission to eliminate a North America-based, Iran-sponsored network of jihadists. But the Iranian government and the Boston mafia are on separate missions of their own; coincidentally, and incredibly, their independently arrived-at missions are identical, and WI-7 is caught in the middle of an international race to turn the world upside down.
Bravo! Another nail-biter. Johnny Skull and his WI-7 team are on a mission to rid the United States of modern-day Nazis; an extremely vigorous goal, indeed. But who in the American government is working against them? Who in the underworld is working with them? 
The prologue sets the stage, then events happen at break-neck speed all the way to the end. Its like watching a spy-thriller movie. I wasnt able to turn the pages fast enough! I didnt want it to end  An exciting, multi-plotted thriller. Timely, relevant, fast-paced, and thought provoking. It makes me think about the way things might be if
