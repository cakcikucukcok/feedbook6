  <title>A Light in Dark Places - Daniel Sykes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Within the light of the events that shape our stories are the driving thoughts behind our tied conclusions. In reflective delivery of our dreams, our illusions are passed upon the terms of reference within the nitty gritty of the pages interned in our reflections. Our eyes may open to the light of dawns heights, as the sun draws the blue sky in compensation for which the shadows slide. 
In chains of courage that link our societies within the rise of challenge to the levels approached and in need for our labour, we walk within the comforts created for tides upon the currents of rest that sleep inside the rifts of idle sensations to be pronounced by the words in verse to our terms of belief and understanding. Within the precision of the sharpened blade of fact, our wishes are passed in honour of the light they praise and in reflex of the common goals and conscious tests of occasion to which we tackle the deepest conclusions that reap our assets in harvest of the knowledge that frames our worth. 
We drift inside the shining moonlit mantles and depths inside the secrets that possess our fortunes and cast shadows interned by the force of the objects that surround features upon the light we seek. Be careful what you wish as such sort of afterthoughts bear the sincerity of our convictions. Any ease too quick to suggest time has not been wasted in the flames that sight such thoughts as true may only see them coming before such haste attracts our darkest fates in forceful time of the demons that consume our everchanging flights. The story behind the darkest things I know to be true is set to show you all the evil that I draw for you in an image of reference and portrait of what has not just happened to me." />
