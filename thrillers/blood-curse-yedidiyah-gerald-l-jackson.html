  <title>Blood Curse - YedidiYah, Gerald L. Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Webbed in a blood curse: Tells about a young boy who never knew hope or faith. Taken in by women of the night, stealing to put food in his mouth, not knowing virtue and integrity was never at his house. His heart yearned for better life; his world was that of a lonely island of poverty. In the midst of an ocean of material prosperity. A dramatize an appealing condition the desolate valley of black hood. A young boy sucking from the dreadful breasts of Satan, deeply in love with the woman of the night, that took him in. Drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred, stigmata of poverty. Did a dreadful beast emerge? Audaciously, with incredible courage. They called him Lucifer&#39;s baby, most people just called him little man, he had the courage to make it to the top of Lucifer&#39;s Kingdom, and he started to work for the mob, doing any and all that was asked of him. One of the women that took him in captivated him. Betty was his only friend, his joy. He loved her soulful, provocative, spellbinding body. He was under the impulse of her lust for sex. She was his peace. Only she, could he show love. To the world, he was a dreadful beast, brutal and dogmatic. For he was webbed in a curse of hell. His love for money took him from rags to tens of billions of dollars. However, he never forgot the little boys and girls like himself . . . if by some cruel oversight, you have not read &quot;Webbed in a Blood Curse&quot; then you will have a very uncommon pleasure in store for yourself. For you will walk in a desolate valley of poverty and material prosperity. For webbed in a blood Curse will make you visualize the unsightly and thought provoking peoples. Your heart will yearn for its 355 pages of pure action. Unsightly at its best. Just open the door to the souls in desolation. You will be able to see Lucifer&#39;s children and the graves yearning for their bodies, stigmata of Hell" />
