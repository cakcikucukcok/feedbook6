  <title>Nothing but Dust - Edwin G. Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At a popular local gun club, a federal warden named Sidney ONeil is found dead on the skeet range. Investigators believe the death was accidental, but ONeils friends know better. Not only did ONeil never shoot skeet, but he was also engaged in a political battle with right-wing extremists. It had to be murder, plain and simple.
Jane Lindsey, the wife of one of ONeils friends, begins snooping around, with the help of her husband and his co-workers. She digs into the records of C. Jeffery Compton, medical director of the local hospital. He and his cronies are part of the group squaring off against ONeil and just happened to have been in the gun clubs clubhouse the day ONeil died.
When Jane learns from Sids grieving widow that Compton had a short affair with Mrs. ONeil, the stakes grow larger. Jane realizes that not only was ONeils death possibly politically-motivated, but that it also might have been the result of a love affair gone wrong. But Compton isnt the only suspect on her list; as Jane digs deeper into the mystery, her shocking discoveries put her directly in the killers path. 
With heart-pumping tension and a plot full of twists and turns, &lt;i&gt;Nothing But Dust&lt;/i&gt; introduces a charming amateur detective in Jane Lindsey." />
