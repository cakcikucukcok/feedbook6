  <title>Borrowing the Truth - Nicky Hindmarsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hannah and Martha Hutton were left to pick up the pieces of their lives after their parents die suddenly in a tragic car crash. The police are not convinced it was simply an accident but a deliberate attempt on their lives. With very little to go on and no witnesses, the case went cold. 
While trying to make sense of the tragedy, Hannah commits to staying with her younger sister in the family home. She must take a job in her Uncles law firm and give up her dream to go to University. While her sisters personal life flourishes, Hannahs is put on hold, delaying her own happiness in the hopes that she will one day find out the truth behind her parents murders.
Hannah has a chance encounter one day with Joe Hastings, a Special Investigations Officer, who offers to review her parents case. Once the case is re-opened, it triggers a series of alarming events that forever changes the innocent life that Hannah once knew. 
Hannah discovers that those who she cares most about are not who she believes them to be. The secrets, once revealed, lead her to doubt everything she once had faith in and leads her to question the honesty of those she thought she knew." />
