  <title>Behind Closed Doors - Natalie R. Collins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For twenty years, they had been closer than sisters, sharing girlhood secrets, their hopes and dreams for the future--and a soul-searing promise. Melissa was the only one who knew what had really happened to Jannie beyond the sacred walls of the Mormon Temple the night that changed her life forever....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNTIL HER BEST FRIEND VANISHED WITHOUT A TRACE.&lt;br&gt;Now Melissa has gone missing, just days after entrusting Jannie with a mysterious box that someone would kill to possess. And someone has--leaving in their murderous wake an innocent victim and a trail of blood that leads to the heart of Jannie&#39;s hidden burden. Desperate to protect her secret, and to find out what has happened to Melissa, Jannie trusts no one. Not the stranger whose piercing green eyes have already seen too much, nor the family and friends whose familiar fold may be shielding a cold-blooded killer who is lurking &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;BEHIND CLOSED DOORS&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
