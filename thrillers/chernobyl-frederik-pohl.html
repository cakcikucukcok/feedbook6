  <title>Chernobyl - Frederik Pohl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hugo and Nebula award-winning science fiction Grand Master Frederik Pohl presents a fictional account of the worst nuclear disaster in human history.  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Chernobyl: The very name conjures the catastrophe that the world feared could happen someday at a nuclear power plant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 26, 1986, a power surge caused the core of one of the reactors to explode, spewing a cloud of radioactive steam into the Ukrainian air. More than four thousand people died, as many as a half-million suffered potentially cancer-causing exposure, and the city around the plant became a toxic wasteland in which nothing could live. Before the disaster at the Chernobyl plant, nuclear catastrophe had been only a fear, a threat. But when the Chernobyl plant was destroyed, all those fears were suddenly all too real.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Frederik Pohl&#39;s novel of this disaster was written months after the tragic events. He had the cooperation of many people inside the U.S.S.R. with access to technical information and first-person accounts of what is still the most tragic nuclear event in human history and only one of two level 7 nuclear accidents, along with the Fukushima disaster of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is fiction, but it is the most riveting, realistic account of what happened that has ever been written.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
