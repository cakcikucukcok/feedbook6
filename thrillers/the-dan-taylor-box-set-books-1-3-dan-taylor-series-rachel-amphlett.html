  <title>The Dan Taylor Box Set Books 1-3: Dan Taylor series - Rachel Amphlett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;This 3-book box set edition includes the first THREE books in the gripping Dan Taylor espionage series. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;WHITE GOLD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A haunted man. A murdered friend. A deadly enemy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dan Taylor was a bomb disposal expert in the British Army until an IED killed three of his team and left him scarred for life. On the brink of self-destruction, Dan is unable to cope with the nightmares that haunt him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Until the day an estranged friend leaves a voicemail message for him, moments before he is assassinated in cold blood.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Plunged into a global conspiracy, Dan must unravel the research notes that Peter Edgewater left behind to locate an explosive device that is being smuggled towards London by a secretive organisation hell-bent on protecting its assets &amp;ndash; and time is running out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;UNDER FIRE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;An explosion rocks a Qatari natural gas facility&amp;hellip; a luxury cruise liner capsizes in the Mediterranean&amp;hellip; and someone has stolen a submarine&amp;hellip; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Are the events connected?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dan Taylor doesn&amp;rsquo;t believe in coincidences &amp;ndash; all he has to do is convince his superiors they are next in the terrorists&amp;rsquo; line of fire.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As Britain enters its worst winter on record, Dan must elude capture to ensure the country&amp;rsquo;s energy resources are protected. At all costs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In an action-packed adventure, from the Middle East through the Mediterranean to London, Dan and his team are on a quest which will test every choice he makes. Assisted by the exotic Antonia Almasi, Dan realises he faces an adversary far greater than he ever imagined, and not everyone is going to survive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;THREE LIVES DOWN&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Dan Taylor has survived two attempts on his life. The rest of his team are missing, and now a terrorist group has stolen a radioactive isotope from a top secret government project.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Can Dan survive long enough to prevent a nuclear disaster on British soil?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With the Prime Minister determined to re-negotiate the country&amp;rsquo;s place in the European Union, and deals being struck behind closed doors, Dan stumbles across a plot that will shake the country to its core.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If his mission fails, his enemies will overthrow the British government, and Dan will be a wanted man.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If he wants to succeed, he&amp;rsquo;ll have to sacrifice everything." />
