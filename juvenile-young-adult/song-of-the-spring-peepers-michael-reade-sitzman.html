      <meta name="description" content="Jacob and Tyler have been best friends since first grade at William Dawes Elementary in Litchfield, Massachusetts. They&#39;ve gone to each other&#39;s birthday parties and played at recess. But the summer after fourth grade, Tyler changes and will now be known as Brianna. He&#39;d always been a girl inside, just not on the outside.  Jacob understands fifth grade will be interesting for both of them. It&#39;s not going to be easy. He worries about the class tough guy and a teacher who makes everybody miserable. He thinks about the girl he secretly loves and if he&#39;ll have the courage to talk to her. Jacob wonders how he&#39;ll protect his best friend when Brianna&#39;s secret is revealed. Can Jacob use the power of his words to unite the gang and get the grown-ups on their side?   A fiction book for kids, Song of the Spring Peepers follows ordinary students as they deal with questions of identity, bullying, prejudice, love, and loyalty. It will be a year the students at William Dawes will remember." />
