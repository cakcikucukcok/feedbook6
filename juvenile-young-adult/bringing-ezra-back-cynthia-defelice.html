  <title>Bringing Ezra Back - Cynthia DeFelice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="September 1840 marks five months since twelve-year-old Nathan Fowler&#39;s life-threatening encounter with Weasel, the heartless man who stalked Nathan like a wild animal through the forest. Nathan hasn&#39;t been the same since, wary of every new person he meets - including the visiting peddler Orrin Beckwith. When Beckwith shows Nate and his family a handbill advertising a show with a &quot;white Injun,&quot; a man without a tongue, Nathan is sure the man is his friend Ezra, who lost his tongue to Weasel&#39;s knife. Determined to save Ezra from this traveling show of &quot;human oddities,&quot; Nathan sets out with Beckwith from Ohio to Pennsylvania. On the way, Nathan encounters more people than he&#39;s ever met before, and he begins to learn a thing or two about human nature. The biggest shock, however, is Ezra himself, and it will take more than Nathan bargained for to bring him back home." />
