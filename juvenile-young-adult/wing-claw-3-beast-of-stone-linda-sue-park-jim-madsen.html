  <title>Wing &amp; Claw #3: Beast of Stone - Linda Sue park, Jim Madsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In this third and final installment in the enchanting Wing &amp;#38; Claw trilogy, Newbery Medal-winning author Linda Sue Park sends her young apothecary to the front lines of a fearsome battle, where he must rely on his talents and his friends to defend what he knows is right. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raffa Santana is a healer, not a fighter. As a gifted apothecary, he has amazing instincts for unleashing the potential of magical-seeming plants. But his skills have failed to free the animals that the heartless Chancellor captured and turned against the people of Obsidia&amp;#8212;directly threatening Raffa&amp;#8217;s friends and family. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Raffa and his ragtag group of allies are preparing to confront the Chancellor&amp;#8217;s armies in battle. Great beasts, small animals, and humans alike will be joining the fight, and Raffa&amp;#8217;s heart yearns to prevent injuries&amp;#8212;and worse&amp;#8212;on both sides of the battle. After all, the Chancellor&amp;#8217;s creatures will be fighting against their will. Can Raffa&amp;#8217;s instincts for apothecary arts bring a tolerable resolution to an impossibly unfair fight?&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;" />
