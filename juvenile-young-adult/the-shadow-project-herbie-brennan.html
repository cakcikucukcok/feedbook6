He inadvertently breaks into the headquarters of the Shadow Project, a secret government organization where teenage spies are trained to leave their bodies, using astral projection to travel around the world on deadly missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danny is captured, but the Project leaders quickly realize he has a special gift.
