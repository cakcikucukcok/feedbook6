  <title>Tonight the Streets Are Ours: Chapters 1-5 - Leila Sales</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Recklessly   loyal. That&#39;s how seventeen-year-old Arden Huntley has always thought of   herself. Taking care of her loved ones is what gives Arden purpose in her   life and makes her feel like she matters. But lately she&#39;s grown resentful of   everyone--including her needy best friend and her absent mom--taking her   loyalty for granted.&lt;br&gt;   Then Arden stumbles upon a website called Tonight the Streets Are Ours, the   musings of a young New York City writer named Peter, who gives voice to   feelings that Arden has never known how to express. He seems to get her in a   way that no one else does, and he hasn&#39;t even met her.&lt;br&gt;   Until Arden sets out on a road trip to find him.&lt;br&gt;   During one crazy night out in New York City filled with parties, dancing,   and music--the type of night when anything can happen, and nearly everything   does--Arden discovers that Peter isn&#39;t exactly who she thought he was. And   maybe she isn&#39;t exactly who she thought she was, either.&lt;/p&gt;" />
