  <title>Anya and the Shy Guy - Suze Winegardner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you&#39;re looking for an excellent, well-written, cute, fun YA romance read, Anya and the Shy Guy is well worth checking out. I adored it!&quot; &lt;b&gt;-Deanna, Okie Dreams Book Reviews&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Anya Anderson doesn&#39;t just need a big break, she needs&lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; break. Living on the streets doesn&#39;t leave a girl many options, so when she scores a gig reporting on the Seconds to Juliet tour, she jumps at the chance to earn enough money to sleep somewhere safe. And the paycheck will get bigger--and keep her off the streets for good--if she can dig up dirt on Will Fray, the irritatingly hot &quot;shy guy&quot; of the band.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Problem is, Will Fray isn&#39;t who everyone thinks he is. In fact, he&#39;s not Will at all. Matt, Will&#39;s identical twin, is actually the guy onstage, reluctantly covering for his brother while he&#39;s in rehab. To make matters worse, Matt&#39;s being shadowed by a cute reporter with troubled eyes determined to get the scoop. On &lt;i&gt;him&lt;/i&gt;. And he&#39;s having trouble finding the willpower to keep his distance...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if the secret gets out, it won&#39;t just be his head on a platter--it&#39;ll be the whole band&#39;s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disclaimer: This Entangled Teen Crush book contains steamy make out scenes, graphic language, and a love story so hot your copy may spontaneously burst into flames.
