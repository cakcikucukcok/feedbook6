  <title>Magic of the Moonlight: A Full Moon Novel - Ellen Schreiber</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Beware of a bite under a full moon . . . It will complicate your love life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Celeste has more to worry about than a secret romance with a hot guy from the wrong side of town. That guy, Brandon, is a werewolf. With gossip and hostility swirling at school, it&amp;#8217;s time to find a cure for his nocturnal condition, and perhaps the one person who can help is his scientist father. But what if a &amp;#8220;cure&amp;#8221; makes things worse and Brandon becomes a werewolf full time? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep Brandon&amp;#8217;s secret safe, Celeste must hide her relationship with him from her best friends, but with the Moonlight Ball approaching, she must make a choice. Her dream is to go with her one true love&amp;#8212;Brandon. But once the sun goes down, the clouds separate, and the full moon appears, could she really walk into the dance on the arm of a werewolf?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this installment of the sumptuously romantic Full Moon series, Celeste faces her fears and her friends and finds out whether she&amp;#8217;s strong enough to stand up for herself and her one true love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
