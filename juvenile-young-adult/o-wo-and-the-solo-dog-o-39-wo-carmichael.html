  <title>O’Wo and the Solo Dog - O&#39;wo Carmichael</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Owo and the Solo Dog is the first of what I hope are many enjoyable and magical tales of Owo (thats me) and the Solo dog (thats him over there lying down, napping).
This book is about the magical talents Solo is sharing with me along with all his animal friends.
These tales are intended to entertain and amaze, but in order to enjoy, you must believe.
So close your eyes and take a deep breath; now open them and get ready. 
Join me, Toby (our oldest grandson, in this book 1), and of course, the Solo dog as we learn . . .
Animals really do talk!
And like many circumstances in our everyday lives, we all can learn from so much from those around us.
Please enjoy 
Owo and the Solo Dog, 
a labor of love." />
