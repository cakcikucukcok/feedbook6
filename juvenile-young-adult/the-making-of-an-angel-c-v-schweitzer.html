  <title>The Making of an Angel - C. V. Schweitzer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Angel Shines in Hearts Chosen by Fate in New Picture Book About Redemption and is dedicated to all animals who find themselves abandon.
 Purchased as a Christmas gift then dumped on the street when the responsibilities of ownership become too much, Millie a young golden retriever finds herself in a strange alliance with a funny-sounding Irish cricket named Finnegan Shamus Finn ORiley who, she meet at Wilmont County Courthouse in the process of a Small Claims hearing for the dogs custody.  Millie is a heroine.  She saved a babys life, the first instance of the angelic in an angelic chain that turns full circle at the court.  Hearing of the impending reward, her old abusive owners want to reclaim ownership of her and thats how she and Finn meet.  About angels in unique forms and guises in the urban setting, C. V. Schweitzers The Making Of An Angel is an absorbing, poignant tale of fate, mercy and redemption.
Finn is a denizen of the courthouse, making his home in its holding cell.  This is Millies tale though, and she recounts her story to old Finn who is in no doubt that he would provide luck in the proceedings.  Millie herself is saved by Officer Sandy Simms who takes her in after she was found to have kept a lost baby warm an entire night before the garbage disposal truck arrived in the early hours.  The police were called in to respond to what would have been a heartbreaking tragedy of dead innocents had not fate provided more angels to keep both baby and dog from another day out in the streets.  
Officer Simms and Millie find kindred souls in each other.  The lady officer renames her Angel and treats her with the affection she knew as a puppy, when her former owners still thought her cute and cuddly.  These owners, Bill and Sue Hall, have heard about Millie in the news and proceeded to lay legal claim to her, probably inspired by the 10,000 dollar reward that Millie/Angel had been given by saving the child.   A crazy old Judge named McGill was about to hand down a Solomonic verdict if the Halls proved to be still deserving of Millies ownership when Finn the Lucky Cricket, as he had predicted, saves the day.  Millie/Angel and Officer Simms, now legally bound to each other, go out of the courthouse free and proven to be angels of mercy in their own right." />
