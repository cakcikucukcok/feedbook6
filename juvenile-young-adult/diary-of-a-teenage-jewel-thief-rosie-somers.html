  <title>Diary of a Teenage Jewel Thief - Rosie Somers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Most sixteen-year-olds shouldn&#39;t know where museums keep their rarest jewels (the basement) and they really shouldn&#39;t know that vans make the worst getaway cars. But for Marisol Flores, a life of jewel thievery is a birthright handed down from generation to generation, even if she didn&#39;t ask for it. So when a rival thief targets Mari and her mother, Mari&#39;s more than happy to flee to the anonymity of bustling New York City. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blending in is a dream come true for Mari, but keeping her former thieving ways a secret gets way more complicated when handsome Will Campbell sets his sights on her. She can&#39;t help but like his terrible puns and charming grin...but when her past catches up with her, it&#39;s not only her life--and her anonymity--that&#39;s at stake.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will could be the next target.&lt;/p&gt;" />
