  <title>Winterbay - J. Barton Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mira Toombs has fled Midnight City, leaving behind her home and the people she loves in a desperate gamble to repair the damage her Tone enhancing artifact has caused. It is a journey that will lead her to Winterbay, an infamous, frozen city built in the middle of Lake Michigan. A place of secrets and conspiracies - and the one place more dangerous for Mira than Midnight City. Winterbay is the last bastion of the World Before, a place that has shunned the power of the Strange Lands, and where being a Freebooter means the death sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get what she needs, Mira must take a desperate bargain. One that will lead her into the city&#39;s icy depths, where its greatest and most dangerous secret lies guarded by a massive, deadly machine that rumor and myth say only one person can disarm. The one person not allowed inside the city walls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Freebooter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Winterbay &lt;/i&gt;is a 14,000 word short story, part of J. Barton Mitchell&#39;s CONQUERED EARTH series, set directly before the events of &lt;i&gt;Midnight City &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;The Severed Tower&lt;/i&gt;, showing how Mira Toombs came to be set on a path not only to Clinton Station, but to the two people who would change her life forever.
