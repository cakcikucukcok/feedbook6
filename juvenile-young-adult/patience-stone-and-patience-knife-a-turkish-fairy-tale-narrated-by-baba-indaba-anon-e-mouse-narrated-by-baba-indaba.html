  <title>PATIENCE STONE AND PATIENCE KNIFE - A Turkish Fairy Tale narrated by Baba Indaba - Anon E. Mouse, Narrated by Baba Indaba</title>
      <meta name="description" content="ISSN: 2397-9607 Issue 431&lt;br /&gt;
In this 430th issue of the &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Baba Indaba&amp;rsquo;s Children&amp;#39;s Stories &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;series, Baba Indaba narrates the Turkish Fairy Tale of &amp;ldquo;Patience Stone and Patience Knife&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A long, long time ago in Turkey there was once a poor woman who had a daughter. While the mother went out washing, the daughter remained at home making beautiful embroidery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One day as the maiden was at work by the window, a little bird flew in and said: &amp;quot;Oh my poor maiden, your kismet is with a dead person,&amp;quot; and immediately flew off again. The girl&amp;#39;s mind was now completely disturbed, and when her mother came home in the evening she told her what the bird had said. &amp;quot;Always be sure to fasten the door and window while you are at work,&amp;quot; advised her mother.&lt;br /&gt;
The next day the girl secured the door and window, and commenced her work, when suddenly, purr!--and the bird perched itself on her embroidery table. &amp;quot;Oh my poor maiden, your kismet is with a dead person,&amp;quot; it said as before, and flew away. The girl was more frightened than ever and told her mother when she came home. The next day she hid in the cupboard under the stairs&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;
What happened next you ask&amp;hellip;? Did the bird somehow find her hiding place and was she forever going to remain hidden, or would something else entirely happen? To find the answers to this question, and any others you may have, you will have to download and read this story to find out!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Baba Indaba is a fictitious Zulu storyteller who narrates children&amp;#39;s stories from around the world. Baba Indaba translates as &amp;quot;Father of Stories&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
