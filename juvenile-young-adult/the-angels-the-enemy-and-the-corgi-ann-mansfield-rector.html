  <title>The Angels, the Enemy and the Corgi - Ann Mansfield Rector</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ann lives on the Gulf Coast of Florida where she continues to write. Bryn died and was replaced by Torri and then Poppet. Poppet speaks much less than her predecessors. I like what C .S. Lewis says about Christian writers: &quot;that we don&#39;t need more books about Christianity, but more Christians writing books.&quot; Spiritual warfare is a profound subject and a war that wages constantly around us. I have made a research project out of it and how a clever enemy and deceitful enemy knows just where to strike us in his never ending battle against the almighty kingdom of heaven--a battle he will lose. Angels are powerful warriors in this battle. I did a master thesis on the works of C.S. Lewis and am much indebted to his Screwtape letters, out of which this novel grew. Bible Study Fellowship International of San Antonio, Texas is one of the greatest programs available in this country and abroad for the dissemination of Bible knowledge and wisdom. It is to that organization that the royalties of this book will flow." />
