  <title>Lolly Molly and the Lollipop Tree - Nana Pam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My name is Nana Pam, and I write books for children.
The stories came about because my two grandchildren wanted stories they had not heard before, so we invented this little village of fairies called Celrin. The name Celrin came about by using half of Celine&#39;s name and half of Catrin&#39;si.e., Celrin.
I do hope you will come and visit us there to meet their little fairy friends.
I have written lots of lovely stories but not just about Celrin. I do hope one day you will get to read them.
Love to all friends of fairies.
