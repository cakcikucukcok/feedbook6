  <title>The Crows of Bosville, Usa - Beverlyn D. Trimble</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hi, my name is RJ. Im the baby in my family. All four of us  siblings were born the same day. But I was the last to come out, so I guess that makes me the baby. My dad always wanted six kids but after me, Mama Lana said, Enough. I was a handful from the day we all were hatched and because I was the only boy to be born, Papa Rocco named me Rocco Jr. But everyone calls me RJ. My sisters are Minnie, Tina, and Annie. 
We live on a street called Fruits of the Spirit in Tree #9, Bosville, USA. There are nine trees on our street and each tree represents a level youve obtained as a family spiritually. The higher your tree number, the greater you are growing in Fruits of the Spirit. Not just any family can live on this street; you have to meet only one criterion as husband and wife to live on this street. The criterion is a willingness to live your life according to the spiritual principles represented by the nine fruits. 
My parents worked hard and it took quite a while because these nine principles take a lot of patience, endurance, and faith to develop in a person. But they didnt give up even in the midst of challenges; as a result, they were able to build their nest home in Tree #9 and start to raise their family. Our community is a close community, and we have beautiful trees that change colors according to the season. A lot happens on this street, and I cant wait to share with you some of the adventures we have endured as a family and as a community. 
So this is the first of a series of stories about me and my family and the town where we live, Bosville, USA. Oh, yes, I forgot to mention, there are a lot of us in this town. I have hundreds of aunts, uncles, and cousins. So lets see, where should I begin? . . . 
Did I also mention that when you live in a house with all females, its hard to get a word in edgewise? So I listen a lot and, boy, do I hear a lot of crazy girlie stuff! So I decided to write first about my sister Minnie and the night she narrowly escaped from old, mean Mr. Homer the Owl." />
