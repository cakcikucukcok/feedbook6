  <title>Abbey and Jakey - Phyllis Yohn-Rhodes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the true story about two very special cocker spaniels and their human mom (me)Phyllis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Some believe it to be no more then coincidental but some will see, as I do. There is greater being and when you believe and are in need, anything can and does happen. As you read this true story, you too can decide for yourself.  Abbey, Jakey and I know, it was meant to be and I feel blessed everyday.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Phyllis Yohn-Rhodes lives in a small town in central Pennsylvania with her husband Dusty and of course the ruler of the household Jakey.   The loss of her beloved &quot;ABBEY&quot; to hemolytic amenia was truly devastating. Writing this book was a task of love and a need to help the grieving process.  In doing so, many good things have happened not only for her but for a male cocker spaniel who had been abused and living in a cage. Hence, the story of she and Jakey finding each other.  She and Jakey decided to share his happy story of finally coming home.  As told by Jakey with pictures and text. &quot;JAKEYS HAPPY TALE&quot; is included in this book. Please visit her web site for more information and also see other projects and more published books by Phyllis Yohn-Rhodes.  Two delightful childrens picture story books are now also available.
