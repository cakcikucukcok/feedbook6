  <title>Born into Greyworld - Kathleen Medina</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Twelve-year-old Kate wakes every morning to the bitter reality of Greyworld  a barren, industrial land locked in perpetual twilight since the cataclysmic event known as the Shift. Protocol monitors all aspect of citizens lives. Imagination and individuality are suppressed. Children are disciplined and controlled through the use of behavior-moderating substances.   
Kate tries to bury herself in the underground world of books and movies that her mysterious friend and mentor, Mrs. Hatpin, left to her before her sudden disappearance. Kate escapes into her dreams and travels to other realms of beauty and nature and magical possibilities. But as the horrifying specter of Shadowman begins to infiltrate her dreams, she realizes nowhere is safe. Then Kate sees him outside her school. Is he real? How could he be both in her dreams and in her everyday life? Could he be behind the epidemic of missing students? 
The dimensions of reality and imagination begin to overlap as clues to an existence beyond Greyworld emerge. Can Kate access this other world before it is too late and Protocol gains control of her mind? Can dreams be just as real as waking life?" />
