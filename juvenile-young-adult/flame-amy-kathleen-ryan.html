  <title>Flame - Amy Kathleen Ryan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the thrilling conclusion to Amy Kathleen Ryan&#39;s Sky Chasers series, Waverly, Kieran, and Seth struggle to survive on-board the New Horizon--and take down their enemies before it&#39;s too late &lt;br&gt;Waverly and the other members of the Empyrean have been scattered, and their home ship destroyed. Their mission to rescue their parents didn&#39;t go as planned, and now they&#39;re at an even greater disadvantage: trapped with their enemies on the New Horizon, trying to find a way to survive. Kieran has been pulled under Anne Mather&#39;s wing, but is she really trying to make peace, or just using Kieran to build her own power? Meanwhile, Waverly is taken in by a mysterious old man who wants to help her bring Anne Mather down--but the more Waverly cooperates with him, the more dangerous her position is, and the more at odds with Kieran she becomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seth&#39;s situation is even worse. After setting out from the Empyrean on his own, with only a vague strategy to guide him, he is a fugitive aboard the New Horizon. He&#39;s doing what he can to challenge the power of Anne Mather, but he&#39;s badly hurt, and getting sicker. All the while, unknown to him, the terrorist Jacob is making plans of his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Seth ever see Waverly again? Will his health hold out long enough to help her topple their enemies? And will Waverly find a way to unite with her friends before they all fall? Nothing is sure and every moment is a risk in &lt;i&gt;Flame&lt;/i&gt;, the explosive finale of the Sky Chasers series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
