  <title>Ladycat to the Rescue - Joann Ellen Sisco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A multicolored cat with dainty feet and a lady-like walk, loved to be useful.  She even looked for ways she could help, and usually found them.
   Also, there was the pair of two-legged animals who were so busy talking they failed to watch where they went or what was going on around them.  The summer camp was filled with animals with four legs, two legs and no legs at all, and the girls forgot to be careful.  Not good!
   But that was not the only time the cat had tussled with a snake.  She must have realized the two cousins had important business on their minds while they enjoyed a summer together.
   This is the eleventh book of the Twenty Book Series, Wildwood Village Summer Camp, where 25 girls, ages ten to twelve, could spend a summer with each other and the local animals of central Oklahoma." />
