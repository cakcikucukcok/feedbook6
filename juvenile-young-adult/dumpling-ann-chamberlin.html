      <meta name="description" content="The family had been wanting a new cat since Katie had died when she was nearly nineteen years old. Mum didnt want to replace her straight away, but always had stories to tell about what she used to get up to.
The children often asked when can we get a cat?
However, it was just one excuse after another:
when the new baby gets a little older;
when Faith (the baby) goes to school;
when weve been to Kenya;
when weve moved house.
Well they moved house and Mum tried to say to wait until all the work was done in the house, but the children were having none of that." />
