  <title>Dare Mighty Things - Heather Kaczynski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Selection&lt;/em&gt; meets &lt;em&gt;The 5th Wave&lt;/em&gt; in this heart-racing debut duology about a girl competing for a spot on a mysterious mission to the outer reaches of space.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE RULES ARE SIMPLE: You must be gifted. You must be younger than twenty-five. You must be willing to accept the dangers that you will face if you win.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eighteen-year-old Cassandra Gupta&amp;#8217;s entire life has been leading up to this&amp;#8212;the opportunity to travel to space. But to secure a spot on this classified mission, she must first compete against the best and brightest people on the planet. People who are as determined as she is to win a place on a journey to the farthest reaches of the universe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cassie is ready for the toll that the competition will take; the rigorous mental and physical tests designed to push her to the brink of her endurance. But nothing could have prepared her for the bonds she would form with the very people she hopes to beat. Or that with each passing day it would be more and more difficult to ignore the feeling that the true objective of the mission is being kept from her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the days until the launch tick down and the stakes rise higher than ever before, only one thing is clear to Cassie: she&amp;#8217;ll never back down...even if it costs her everything.&lt;/p&gt;" />
