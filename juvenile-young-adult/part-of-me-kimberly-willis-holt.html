  <title>Part of Me - Kimberly Willis Holt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The lives of four generations of one Louisiana family, woven together by a master storyteller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracing a family&#39;s roots is like taking a journey through the years. In the case of one Louisiana family, that journey can be charted by the books they read and loved. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The journey begins in 1939 with Rose, who moves with her mother and siblings from rural Texas to live with their estranged grandfather in the Louisiana bayou. Rose connects with this flavorful community through her love of books and by driving a bookmobile. Two decades later, Merle Henry, Rose&#39;s son, is more passionate about trapping a mink than about reading, although there is a place in his heart for Old Yeller. In 1973, Merle Henry&#39;s daughter, Annabeth, feels torn between reading fairy tales and a crush on a real-life knight in shining armor. And in the present day, Annabeth&#39;s son, Kyle, finds himself in a bind: he hates reading, but the only summer job he can get is at the library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her people-smart way, Kimberly Willis Holt introduces us to a Louisiana family: touching, lyrical, and always intriguing, their stories reveal the powerful connections between four generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Part of Me&lt;/i&gt; is a 2007 Bank Street - Best Children&#39;s Book of the Year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
