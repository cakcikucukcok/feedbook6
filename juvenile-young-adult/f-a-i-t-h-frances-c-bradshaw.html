  <title>F-A-I-T-H - Frances C. Bradshaw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When we go through trials in life we need to read the word of God, and also pray to God for understanding, guidance,  and direction. But it is our faith in Him that gets us through our trials.  If we dont have faith it is impossible to please God.  He delights in helping us when we put all our trust in him.  That is when we give our problems to Him and begin praising and glorifying Him. ( Habakkub 3:17 -19) I implore you to try Him.  Your life will not be the same.  I find the more I trust Him the better I feel, and I have more peace during my trials, and yes we will always have trials, but we have a loving Father who wants to guide us through them.  Keep in mind that everything we need during our trials is at hand, and God our Father is working it out for our good  as we endure the trials, test, and challenges  that life  presents to us.     (Psalm 23)
Blessings to you as you strengthen your faith walk with our Heavenly Father.
                Deacon  Frances C. Bradshaw" />
