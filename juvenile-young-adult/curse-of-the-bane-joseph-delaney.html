  <title>Curse of the Bane - Joseph Delaney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it&#39;s the dark&#39;s turn to be afraid &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Spook and his apprentice, Thomas Ward, deal with the dark. Together they rid the county of witches, ghosts, and boggarts. But now there&#39;s some unfinished business to attend to in Priestown. Deep in the catacombs of the cathedral lurks a creature the Spook has never been able to defeat; a force so evil that the whole county is in danger of being corrupted by its powers. The Bane!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Thomas and the Spook prepare for the battle of their lives, it becomes clear that the Bane isn&#39;t their only enemy. The Quisitor has arrived, searching for those who meddle with the dark so he can imprison them&amp;#8212;or worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can Thomas defeat the Bane on his own? Is his friend Alice guilty of witchcraft? And will the Spook be able to escape the Quisitor&#39;s clutches?&lt;/p&gt;" />
