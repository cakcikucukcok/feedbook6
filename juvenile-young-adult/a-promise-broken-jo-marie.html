  <title>A Promise Broken - Jo-Marie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Imagine being a very tiny being in a world of giants where your town is built into the side of a cliff. What would happen if earthquake tremors rocked your town?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumbling begins. A hole opens down below. Homes sink into the cliff. The ground is swallowing Cliff City! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ayden tries to keep moving along the wall, but the very ground hes standing on is collapsing. He knows he cant leap to safety, but Jeffy is still in his arms. In a desperate attempt to save Jeffy, he yells to Tony who is ahead of him. As Tony turns, Ayden flings Jeffy. Tony reaches and grabs Jeffy, pulling him tightly to his chest. Just as Jeffy is safe, the ground under Ayden gives way. He plummets downward! Bev and Tony scream, but cant stop his descent. Ayden closes his eyes and falls into blackness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Cliff City survive? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What will happen to Tunnel Town? Can their passageways withstand the shaking? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about Maple Community? What damage will the tremors do to the town inside the tree?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Adis World survive?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Promise Broken is the third book in the Adis World series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
