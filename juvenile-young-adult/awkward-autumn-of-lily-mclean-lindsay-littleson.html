  <title>Awkward Autumn of Lily Mclean - Lindsay Littleson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lily&#39;s hoping to put all the madness of the previous summer behind her. Telling people you hear voices doesn&#39;t win you many friends. Especially when you&#39;re starting high school. Especially when everyone thinks you&#39;re just like your troublemaking big sister. At least Lily&#39;s best mates Rowan, David and Aisha will stand up for her. But when she finds nasty messages in her locker, Lily knows someone&#39;s out to steal her friends and leave her all alone. Lily hopes a fun trip to the Isle of Arran will bring her friends together, but soon those dramas seem like the least of her problems. Back home, her big sister&#39;s in big trouble: She might end up in jail -- or worse. The last thing Lily wants is to start up that weird psychic stuff again, but it might be her only hope...
Spend the autumn with Lily in this beautifully written, laugh-out-loud sequel to Waterstones Children&#39;s Book Prize longlister The Mixed-Up Summer of Lily McLean by Kelpies Prize winner Lindsay Littleson." />
