  <title>Being Different - Ron Winnegrad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a book about being different and having the courage to embrace that difference and accepting difference and originality in others. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Being Different is about accepting yourself for your difference and in turn accepting others.  Being different does not mean one is bad or inferior.  Being different can mean being on a different path or mindset.  It is about having the confidence to walk a different path, in finding comfort in not being or doing like others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Being different should give you the strength to stand tall, rely on your beliefs and not be upset if your socks dont match!  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Embrace everyone and everything, even if they are different.  It is a chance to show you something new.  Many successful people become so because they looked at being different.
You can go to a different level by being different." />
