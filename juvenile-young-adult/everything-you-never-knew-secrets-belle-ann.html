      <meta name="description" content="Ashley was beautiful and delicate, easily pleased and effortlessly broken.  The unexpected death of pop star Ashley Noelle came as a shock to her family, friends, and fans.  Ashley&#39;s best friend Rachel Casper rushes home from college to find that Ashley left behind a journal filled with dark secrets and confessions. Rachel quickly sinks into Ashley&#39;s world of highs and lows, friends turning into enemies, boys that broke her heart, fans that crossed the line and secrets she&#39;d shamed herself into keeping.  Ashley&#39;s journal unintentionally gives away clues about her death, but Rachel doesn&#39;t know this yet. She has no idea that the journal she&#39;s reading opens up a lot more than Ashley&#39;s insecurities. It names the people responsible for the end of her life....  There are two kinds of secrets; the kind you want to keep in, and the kind you don&#39;t dare let out." />
