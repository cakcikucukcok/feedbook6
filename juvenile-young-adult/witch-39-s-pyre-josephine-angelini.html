  <title>Witch&#39;s Pyre - Josephine Angelini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Lily Proctor has come a long way from the weak, sickly girl she used to be.  She has gained power as a witch and a leader, found her way home, chosen to  face battle again, and (after losing her first love and being betrayed by her new  love) she has learned more about loss and grief than she ever wanted to know. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thrust once again into a society different  from anything they have ever seen, Lily and her coven are determined to find  answers--to find a new path to victory, a way to defeat the monstrous  Woven &lt;i&gt;without&lt;/i&gt; resorting to nuclear weapons &lt;i&gt;or &lt;/i&gt;becoming a tyrannical mass murderer like her  alternate self, Lillian. But sometimes winning requires sacrifices . . . and  when the only clear path to victory lies at Lillian&#39;s side, what price will Lily be willing to pay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internationally bestselling author Josephine Angelini takes us on another emotionally wrenching thrill ride in the stunning conclusion to her Worldwalker Trilogy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
