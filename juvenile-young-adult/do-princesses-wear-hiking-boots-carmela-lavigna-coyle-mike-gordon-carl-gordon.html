  <title>Do Princesses Wear Hiking Boots? - Carmela LaVigna Coyle, Mike Gordon, Carl Gordon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every inquisitive little girl wonders what it is really like to be a genuine princess. At the heart of Do Princesses Wear Hiking Boots? lives an energetic, spirited, and contemporary child who has lots of important questions for her mom. Do princesses ride tricycles, climb trees, do chores, or have to eat the crusts of their bread? The mother&#39;s voice is timelessly reassuring as she answers her daughter&#39;s questions and advises her that being like a princess has to do with what we are on the inside. An illustrated picture frame surrounds a mirror at the end of the book which answers the little girl&#39;s most important question. This heart-warming book offers a gentle lesson about self-acceptance, and will inspire children to follow their dreams and leave their own mark on the world." />
