      <meta name="description" content="Six girls, six personalities, one home. Marley Hart, Leeanna Morgan, sisters Summer and Lauren Black, Amanda Tanner and little Madison Brown are the girls of Charity. Each of them has arrived at the Charity Home for Girls for a different reason, Summer and Lauren are there because their parents died and there was no one to care for them while Marley waits for her mother to come to take her away to a wonderful new lifeone that will never happen.  
All is well in their small world until the day the girls collide with the rich of Charity, Connecticut. They attend the local school and try to fit in but everyone knows where they live and the circumstances of why they are there. Unaware that the town&#39;s gossip is targeting the girls as unworthy and not respectable, they each struggle to fit in and to achieve the popularity and happiness that they desire, sometimes at a high cost! 
In the tough times that lie ahead, will the girls fall victim to the towns gossip? Or, will they learn to trust in the people they care for and who care about them by discovering the true meaning of friendship and family?" />
