      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Finding  out that she is the True Dream Walker hasn&#39;t gone at all the  way Joshlyn  Weaver would have expected it to. The only special gift she  seems to  have is an ability to create archways, which really isn&#39;t that  special.  In addition to her inability to connect with the Dream, she has  also  started having nightmares that are so terrible she can&#39;t tell  anyone  about them. Not even Will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just when Josh thought her life   couldn&#39;t get any more complicated, the lost dream walker princess   returns to claim her parents&#39; right to the throne, right as the   Lodestone party threatens to take control of the government during the   upcoming Accordance Conclave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the clock running down, Josh   must rely on not only her friends, but also her enemies, to stop the   radicals from taking power and controlling the Dream. But how can she   expect to save everyone else when she&#39;s struggling to pick up the  pieces  of her own shattered life?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dreamfever &lt;/i&gt;will have you on the edge of your seat as Kit Alloway  takes you even deeper into the world of the dream walkers, and will  leave you begging for more!&lt;/p&gt;" />
