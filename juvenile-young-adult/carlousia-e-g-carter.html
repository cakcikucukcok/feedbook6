  <title>Carlousia - E. G. Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Eddie Caskitt is filled with relief. The worries of moving into a new neighborhood, making friends, and starting a new school have been weighing him down. But after spending just a few minutes with the kids of Drayton Woods, Eddie realizes that the adventurous summer he was hoping for might just happen after all. Eddie hopes all the fun he anticipates will ease the pain of knowing his grandfather is dying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With his last bit of strength before he passes away, Eddies grandfather whispers that he has left something for Eddie in his barnand that the tall tales he has been telling Eddie for years are true. With the help of a magic bracelet he finds inside a secret hole in the barn, Eddie and his two new friends, Dan and Scotty, enter a portal where they are suddenly thrust into roles guarding the world of Carlousia. Now the boys must conquer fear, outwit predators, unfold betrayal, and overthrow evilall while pretending everything is normal at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this extraordinary adventure, three boys take a wild, coming-of-age journey that intertwines risk, honor, loyalty, and the kind of danger that unfortunately may lead to unimaginable loss.&lt;/p&gt;" />
