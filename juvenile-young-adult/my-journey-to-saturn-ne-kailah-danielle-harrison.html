Reggie, Pepper and Icon want to encourage you to read to a child, because all children want to discover places and people that seem to only exist in their imagination.   
Learning that there are people in this world that do not look like you, speak the same language as you even dress differently than you; this help us embrace those different , and we learn to love and respect each other no matter who we are or where we live." />
