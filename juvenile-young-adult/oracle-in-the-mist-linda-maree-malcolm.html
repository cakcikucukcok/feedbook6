  <title>Oracle in the Mist - Linda Maree Malcolm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Bobby&#39;s grandmother was thirteen, she and seven friends disappeared for a period of six days. No-one in town ever talks about this mystery but Bobby wants to know what happened then and if it was the reason why her grandmother always had a sad, faraway look in her eyes. Red-haired, hot-tempered Bobby is an ultra-modern twelve-year-old girl from a Celtic background with ideas that could be described as alternative. Raised to be open-minded and confident by a single, working mother who holds angel card readings and is interested in New-Age beliefs, Bobby is fiercely independent in her own thinking and behaviour. When she meets another home-schooler, David, who is from a big, highly educated Italian family and has been raised to have more conservative, mainstream beliefs and old-fashioned values, it is difficult to imagine how they could ever be friends. However, the do have something in common. David too has a mystery that he wants to solve about his own heritage Bobby is determined that she will solve the mystery of the missing children whether the wary David is prepared to be involved or not. But David does not have much choice. With the help of a crystal ball possessing magical powers that Bobby has just stumbled across, the two are transported through a wormhole into another time dimension where they make startling discoveries, not only about their own ancestries but also about themselves. Join them on an adventure where an evil workhouse and her orc slaves threaten to overrun the idyllic island paradise which has now become their new home." />
