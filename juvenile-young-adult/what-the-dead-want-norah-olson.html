  <title>What the Dead Want - Norah Olson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Haunting photographs and dark family secrets make this second spine-tingling novel from Norah Olson the perfect read for fans of creepy, suspenseful teen fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A love of photography, an old camera, and countless questions&amp;#8212;these are all that sixteen-year-old Gretchen has left of her mother, who mysteriously disappeared years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now she must return to the place where her mom vanished&amp;#8212;a decaying mansion that Gretchen has suddenly inherited from her great-aunt Esther. However, Gretchen won&amp;#8217;t find the answers she&amp;#8217;s seeking without unraveling the secrets that lurk inside the house. There are stacks of photographs and letters from her ancestors that go back centuries, pointing to some kind of haunting past. But when proof of the mansion&amp;#8217;s dark history appears to Gretchen in the form of ghostly visions and the soft, eerie whisper of her mother&amp;#8217;s voice, there&amp;#8217;s no doubt that something sinister has taken place there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how scared she might be, Gretchen must somehow uncover the reasons why this indescribable force has descended upon her family and find a way to set everyone&amp;#8212;even the dead&amp;#8212;free.&lt;/p&gt;" />
