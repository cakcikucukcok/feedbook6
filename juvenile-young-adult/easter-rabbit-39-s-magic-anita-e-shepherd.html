  <title>Easter Rabbit&#39;s Magic - Anita E. Shepherd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Easter has always been a wonderful time, and Mr. Easter Rabbit was always excited to play his part. When he was gifted with magical feet, it was his duty to ensure each person received one special egg. However, people got tired of just one special egg and the desire for quantity rather than quality became the highlight of the holiday. Slowly, Mr. Rabbit began to lose the magic in his feet that allowed him to place the special eggs. Holiday Management was going to retire Mr. Rabbit, but decided to make one last effort to save his position. They took what magic was left in his feet and placed it in a lucky rabbit&#39;s foot. Mr. Rabbit was told that if someone could ever be truly happy with one special egg again, his magic would be restored. In order to accomplish this task, he set out to seek the help from some special people - Brad and Chad. Now, mind you, they weren&#39;t planning on becoming heroes again. Needless to say, their Easter just became a little more interesting - and magical!" />
