      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The sequel to &lt;i&gt;Devil&#39;s Bridge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At thirteen, Ben Daggett, a Martha&#39;s Vineyard local, takes a summer job as first mate on a charter boat and plans to spend the July Fourth weekend helping to entertain tourists. On his first day out, Ben spots a strange object in the water -- a red Porsche. Then he learns that the driver is missing! Donny, a cool sixteen-year-old, admits to having submerged the car -- but nothing more. Also a native, Donny resents the rich tourists, and even steals from them. Despite Donny&#39;s transgressions, Ben would give anything to hang out with him. Unfortunately, he gives too much, and ends up involved in drug dealing and maybe murder, and with full understanding of Donny&#39;s role in at least one of these crimes. Should he tell on Donny? In Cynthia DeFelice&#39;s exciting new adventure novel, the hero faces up to his own weakness and struggles to decide what to do about his friend.&lt;/p&gt;" />
