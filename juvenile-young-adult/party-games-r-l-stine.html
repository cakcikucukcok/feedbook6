  <title>Party Games - R. L. Stine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;R.L. Stine&#39;s hugely successful young adult horror series &lt;i&gt;Fear&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Street&lt;/i&gt; is back with the first new book in almost 2 decades. With more than 80 million copies sold around the world, &lt;i&gt;Fear&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Street &lt;/i&gt;is one of the bestselling young adult series of all time. Now, with &lt;i&gt;Party&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Games&lt;/i&gt;, R.L. Stine revives this phenomenon for a new generation of teen readers, and the announcement of new &lt;i&gt;Fear&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Street&lt;/i&gt; books caused a flurry of excitement both in the press and on social media, where fans rejoiced that the series was coming back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her friends warn her not to go to Brendan Fear&#39;s birthday party at his family&#39;s estate on mysterious Fear Island. But Rachel Martin has a crush on Brendan and is excited to be invited. Brendan has a lot of party games planned. But one game no one planned intrudes on his party--the game of murder. As the guests start dying one by one, Rachel realizes to her horror that she and the other teenagers are trapped on the tiny island with someone who may want to kill them all. How to escape this deadly game? Rachel doesn&#39;t know whom she can trust. She should have realized that nothing is as it seems... on Fear Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;R.L. Stine makes his triumphant return to Shadyside, a town of nightmares, shadows, and genuine terror, and to the bestselling series that began his career writing horror for the juvenile market, in the new &lt;i&gt;Fear&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Street&lt;/i&gt; book &lt;i&gt;Party Games&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
