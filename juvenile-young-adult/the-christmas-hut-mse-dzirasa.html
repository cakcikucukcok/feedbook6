  <title>The Christmas  Hut - Mse. Dzirasa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Christmas Hut is a wonderful book that lends itself beyond the holidays, with childlike innocence, to all who experience it. It is the only book in its category that invites and welcomes children, as well as the young at heart, into the Christmas Holidays, and walks them into the New year, by taking them into a world quite different from their own, yet bound  together by the joyful cheer of the season, as it rings the bells of goodwill towards all, on each page.  Children are instantly transported into an environment where Christmas, though much different from theirs, equally possesses the happy ability  to bring  families and communities together, in a Seaside Town right on the equator, where the children of St Pauls Parish culturally and ethnically come alive within the pages; Skipping into living and bedrooms rooms, and hopping  unto public  library shelves, while bringing the story of their Christmas  holidays,  to children all over the world , in the happy quest to introduce and offer themselves in friendship, to kids who may be curious enough to find out how children far across the seas, in other lands, celebrate this great holiday that binds Christians together all over the world. The book comes in a Junior  Reader as well as a Childrens Picture Book format, splattered colorfully with fun laden bold exciting illustrations, meant to connect the very young   to the text. Trust me!  Your precious ones will find themselves coming back to read this one-of-a-kind holiday book, long after the celebration is done. Seasons greetings   to you and yours.  Happy reading." />
