  <title>Ten Eggsville Eggies Sitting in the Hedge - Dee Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the third story in a series about the eggs of Eggsville. This story was written for a topic I was doing on counting numbers up to 10 for the preschool I worked in at Camelford. I wanted the children to be able to count to 10 and recognize the written word as well. I also incorporated counting backward and forward as well. I wanted to introduce different ways of counting: rote, ordinal, cardinal, and nominal.
RoteCounting to 10 (e.g., to self)
OrdinalOrder of things in a set (e.g., sixth position in a row)
CardinalHow many items there are (e.g., as the story says 10 eggs)
NominalIdentifying items by numbers (e.g., telephone number)
Also the written word ten means the same as the number 10." />
