  <title>Guardian of the Green Hill - Laura L. Sullivan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Only a few weeks ago, Meg Morgan and her siblings went to England for the holidays--and found themselves in the middle of a fairy war. Now the war is over, but the battle for control of the fairies has just begun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mysterious painter named Gwidion appears at the Rookery, ready to give the children art lessons. But his real plans are far more sinister: He means to destroy the Guardian of the Green Hill, the woman who keeps the peace between fairies and humans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meg knows nothing of the evil artist&#39;s plans, but she is beginning to understand that she might be the only one who can become Guardian when her great-great aunt&#39;s time is over. Yet Meg is just a girl--surely she has plenty of time before she must decide whether she wants to take on such an enormous role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then someone she loves is stolen by fairies, and no one but Meg can get him back. . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
