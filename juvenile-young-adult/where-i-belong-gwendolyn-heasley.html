  <title>Where I Belong - Gwendolyn Heasley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Meet Corrinne. She&#39;s living every girl&#39;s dream in New York City&amp;#8212;shopping sprees at Barneys, open access to the best clubs and parties, and her own horse at the country club. Her perfect life is perfectly on track. At least it was. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Corrinne&#39;s father is laid off, her world suddenly falls apart. Instead of heading to boarding school, she&#39;s stripped of her credit cards and shipped off to the boonies of Texas to live with her grandparents. On her own in a big public school and forced to take a job shoveling manure, Corrinne is determined to get back to the life she&#39;s supposed to be living. She doesn&#39;t care who she stomps on in the process. But when Corrinne makes an unlikely friend and discovers a total hottie at work, she begins to wonder if her life B.R.&amp;#8212;before the recession&amp;#8212;was as perfect as it seemed. &lt;/p&gt;" />
