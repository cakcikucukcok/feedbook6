  <title>The Tree That Talks - Barbara Anne Syassen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Annabella enjoys going to the park to spend time with her favourite tree, especially at times when she is feeling sad.  The tree talks to Annabella, and gives her a message about being happy and living in the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When our kids are now skillfully handling iPads before they&#39;re even walking, it&#39;s more important than ever to connect them back with nature. Every one of our books have a special message to tell our young readers, most of which relate back to acts of kindness, staying present in the moment, positive thinking, meditation, prayer, creative visualisation, and of course the importance of enjoying the natural gifts that nature has to offer. Our books have helped many young ones develop a love for reading, learning, being more centred and calm, and so many other positive traits ultimately providing them the tools for happiness and success later on in life. We donate a percentage of our book sales to Lady Musgrave Foundation, helping the homeless children and women of Australia, as well as donating our books to schools in Australia, Nepal, the Pacific, especially Papua New Guinea via Books for PNG Kids, and UNICEF.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The US Review of Books&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
reviewed by Annie Laura Smith&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;If you keep thinking about yesterday, you might miss out on what you can enjoy right now.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book seeks to teach children how to live a positive life daily in spite of disappointments. The subtitle succinctly describes the content of this picture book, and the dedication notes the book is for parents who will teach children this new approach and the children who will carry it forward. Mixed media coloured illustrations by young artists complement the text throughout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story is given from the child&#39;s point of view of a girl named Annabella. Her favourite outing with her mother and dog is a trip to the park. There she talks with her favourite tree. The tree wisely reminds her when she is sad to think about only the present. The tree suggests that Annabella think about things that make her happy so the sad thoughts will go away. The book addresses how to deal with disappointments that are faced by children of all ages. The author provides a meditation in the back of the book which reflects the tree&#39;s advice. It is recommended to read the meditation to children at bedtime. Scripture references provide a biblical connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author describes nature scenes children would enjoy. She worked in natural therapies and grew up in Hula Papua, New Guinea, in the Pacific. This is an area where the people are trying to build a greener community, providing excellent background from which to suggest connecting with nature for peace of mind. The book is an inspirational read for both children and adults. It should even help parents work through some of their own disappointments. Oh, that adults had a talking tree to give them such sage advice.&lt;/p&gt;
