  <title>Robert Fry - Tristyn L. Darymple</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a novel about a boy named Robert Fry who barged into Joshua Bucklys life uninvited.  He just kept bugging him until Joshua let him follow him home. Since day one, this kid thought he could change everything with a can-do attitude and a smile on his face. Joshua didn&#39;t know where he came from or how he ended up in his town, but hes thankful he did. &lt;p&gt;
Joshuas parents were divorced, his mother was a drunk, and his brother just came around when he wasn&#39;t angry at the world. The town always seemed to have minor problems. He thought things were never going to change. Soon enough, this boy did miracles that Joshua couldnt believe anyone could do. Day after day, things happened but nobody had faith in Robert until he did the impossible. He was the town prodigy, changed the lives of many people, and even brought romance into Joshuas life. No one thought that it was possible, least of all, Joshua Buckly.  This is his story." />
