  <title>Fall of Night - Jonathan Maberry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Stebbins Little School is full of bodies. It&#39;s unthinkable to Desdemona Fox. Children are sobbing as panicked teachers and neighbors beat down their family members outside of the school...or the &lt;i&gt;things&lt;/i&gt; that used to be their family members. Parents don&#39;t eat their children do they? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officers Fox and Hammond, along with journalist Billy Trout, are calling it the beginning of the end. This is the zombie apocalypse. An insane escaped serial killer is infecting Stebbins County with a deadly virus, and now the whole world is watching while Fox, Trout, and the remaining inhabitants of Stebbins fight for their life against...what? The undead? The President and the National Guard are ready to nuke Stebbins, PA off the map and cut their losses. But the infection is spreading and fast. Worse, the scientist who created the virus is missing. It&#39;s a numbers game as the body count rises; Fox has to contain the infected and evacuate the living before it&#39;s too late, and the clock is ticking...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fall of Night&lt;/i&gt;, Maberry&#39;s nail-biting sequel to &lt;i&gt;Dead of Night&lt;/i&gt;, picks up where the first novel left off--on a wild goose chase for a madman and the missing scientist who gave him new &quot;un&quot;-life. Chilling, gory, and hair-raisingly scary, Maberry fans won&#39;t be able to read this fast-paced thriller with the lights off.&lt;/p&gt;" />
