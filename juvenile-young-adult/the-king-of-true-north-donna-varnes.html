  <title>The King of True North - Donna Varnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stephanie Zion is one fairy that does not look or act like any of the others. Was she born different for a purpose? Is she really a fairy at all? What will happen when Stephanie fails to heed the warnings of a bee, a butterfly and most of all the queen of the fairies? Will Stephanie discover the truth about Desolation woods? Is there someone being held captive there? Is there really a King of True North who helps those who call out to him, or does he just exist in fairy legends? When seeds get a careless toss and thoughts become unruly, Stephanie opens the door for the quest of a lifetime. 
But is there a sinister plan to destroy her? Are there really evil beings watching her every move? Can the dog or boy protect her or should she even trust them at all? Is there any hope in putting an end to the fear and distrust that separates the giants, the animals and the fairies living in the land? Follow along and discover what can be accomplished when we truly believe." />
