  <title>The Dragon&#39;s Gate - Barry Wolverton, Dave Stevenson</title>

Bren has had enough adventure for one lifetime and would like nothing more than to return to his father in Map. But nothing goes according to plan when the survivors of the &lt;em&gt;Albatross&lt;/em&gt; are rescued by Lady Jean Barrett, a charismatic archaeologist with a sense of destiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barrett is on a quest for the Eight Immortals, ancient artifacts she believes are buried in the tomb of China&amp;#8217;s first emperor&amp;#8212;the location of which has been hidden for nearly two thousand years. The only way for Bren, Mouse, and Barrett to all get what they want is to work together on a dangerous journey into the heart of China, a kingdom long closed to outsiders, where the greatest secrets about Mouse and Bren are waiting to be unveiled. &lt;/p&gt;" />
