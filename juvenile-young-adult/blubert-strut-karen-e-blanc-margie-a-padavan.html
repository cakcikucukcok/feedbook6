  <title>Blubert Strut - Karen E. Blanc, Margie A. Padavan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Blubert Strut is a Who Am I, nature mystery, about a lost blue footed bird and the search to find out who he is. The story begins with the loss of an egg, falling from a helicopter, over a small lake in Ca. Luckily, it lands in a comfy, large nest on the top of a palm tree, leaning over, a blue lake. The giant egg lands in the nest of Melodie and Malcolm Mockingbird, who are very bewildered by the large, blue speckled egg. Her 6 hatchlings are born; then a giant, fully feathered, white bird, with a black beak, and giant blue feet, explodes out of his shell. Blue is 10 times bigger than his fellow hatchlings and eats most of the food.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, Malcolm declares that Blue should move to cousin Connies empty nest. They try to carry him, since Blue doesnt fly yet, but Malcolms heart gives out and they both fall toward the lake. Blue hits his head on a buoy in the lake and passes out, but he is able to climb up, on, what he thinks, is a very large egg, that he tries to hatch. He suffers from memory loss, not knowing who he is. A crowd gathers around trying to help him, till they figure it out. Time to celebrate and dance the high stepping, Blubert Strut.&lt;/p&gt;" />
