  <title>If That Ever Happens to Me - Lois Shepherd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every day, thousands of people quietly face decisions as agonizing as those made famous in the Terri Schiavo case. Throughout that controversy, all kinds of people--politicians, religious leaders, legal and medical experts--made emphatic statements about the facts and offered even more certain opinions about what should be done. To many, courts were either ordering Terri&#39;s death by starvation or vindicating her constitutional rights. Both sides called for simple answers. &lt;i&gt;If That Ever Happens to Me&lt;/i&gt; details why these simple answers were not right for Terri Schiavo and why they are not right for end-of-life decisions today.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Lois Shepherd looks behind labels like &quot;starvation,&quot; &quot;care,&quot; or &quot;medical treatment&quot; to consider what care and feeding really mean, when feeding tubes might be removed, and why disability groups, the faithful, and even the dying themselves often suggest end-of-life solutions that they might later regret. For example, Shepherd cautions against living wills as a pat answer. She provides evidence that demanding letter-perfect documents can actually weaken, rather than bolster, patient choice. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The actions taken and decisions made during Terri Schiavo&#39;s final years will continue to have repercussions for thousands of others--those nearing death, their families, health-care professionals, attorneys, lawmakers, clergy, media, researchers, and ethicists. &lt;i&gt;If That Ever Happens to Me&lt;/i&gt; is an excellent choice for anyone interested in end-of-life law, policy, and ethics--particularly readers seeking a deeper understanding of the issues raised by Terri Schiavo&#39;s case.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
