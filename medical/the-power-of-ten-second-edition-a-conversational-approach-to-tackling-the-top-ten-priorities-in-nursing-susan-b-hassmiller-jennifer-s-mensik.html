  <title>The Power of Ten, Second Edition: A Conversational Approach to Tackling the Top Ten Priorities in Nursing - Susan B. Hassmiller, Jennifer S. Mensik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 2011, The Honor Society of Nursing, Sigma Theta Tau International’s editors asked 30 global nurse leaders to identify 10 of the most critical issues in the profession. The result was the first edition of The Power of Ten, a collection of essays and data- and talking points that explored the obstacles nurses faced. The book challenged long-held beliefs that were stymying progress and invited readers to join the conversation about how to move nursing forward. The time has come to revisit and revise those issues and drive the conversation even further to support real change and progress in the profession. In this all-new edition, Susan B. Hassmiller and Jennifer S. Mensik connected with more than 50 national and international nurse leaders to survey the most pressing issues in the profession. From that feedback, they arrived at a new list of priorities. Through essays, action items, discussion points, and data, The Power of Ten, Second Edition, will help nurses question, converse, and lead the way into the future of nursing." />
