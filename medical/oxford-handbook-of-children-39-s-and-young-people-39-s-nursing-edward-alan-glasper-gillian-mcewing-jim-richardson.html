  <title>Oxford Handbook of Children&#39;s and Young People&#39;s Nursing - Edward Alan Glasper, Gillian McEwing, Jim Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Enabling nurses to deliver safe and effective care and to achieve the best possible results for their patients, the Oxford Handbook of Children&#39;s and Young People&#39;s Nursing, 2nd edition is a concise and practical guide to all aspects of the nurse&#39;s role. 
Covering assessment and management, right through to advice for the family, the expert authors provide information on a wide range of topics, including normal growth and development, pain, palliative care, religion and culture, and professional issues. In addition there is also a separate section on paediatric emergencies and coverage of recognising deviations from the norm as well as interpreting clinical findings and investigations, and measures to promote successful care practice. 
Fully updated and revised for this new edition, it is now packed full of even more clinical information and practical advice, including a wealth of guidance and recommendations that have been gleaned from the authors&#39; many years of experience. The most up-to- date legislation, policy and practice is now covered, including significant changes in child safeguarding, immunisation, medicines, resuscitation protocols and the common assessment framework. The chapter on neonatal care has also been
expanded and now contains information on care and breastfeeding of the pre-term infant, as well as developmental and kangaroo care. Cochlea implants, intussusception and professional issues - such as working with diverse communities, and involving young people in health services have also been included.
Written by practising nurses and subject experts, the Oxford Handbook of Children&#39;s and Young People&#39;s Nursing, 2nd edition continues to be a unique and invaluable companion to practising and student nurses, and to all who need to understand the special issues associated with children&#39;s and young people&#39;s nursing." />
