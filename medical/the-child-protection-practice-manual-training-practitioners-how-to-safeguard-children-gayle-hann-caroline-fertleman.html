  <title>The Child Protection Practice Manual: Training practitioners how to safeguard children - Gayle Hann, Caroline Fertleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Around 85 children die each year in the UK due to abuse or neglect. A number of these deaths are later deemed preventable because the child involved was known to either social services or to a health professional. Cases such as those of Baby P and Victoria Climbie highlighted the failings of these organisations, ones set up to safeguard children. 
 It is the responsibility of every health professional worldwide to identify and respond to child abuse and yet that very responsibility is both emotionally and strategically challenging. The Child Protection Practice Manual: Training practitioners how to safeguard children equips professionals with the ability to recognise a child at risk and the knowledge of how to work with a child already suffering abuse. Practical advice is offered on how to navigate the multi-disciplinary
processes. Fictional case studies and exercises immerse the reader in scenarios. Building on this, the authors lead readers through learning points, recommendations, and legislation. 
 With new definitions in child protection ranging from child sexual exploitation, gang violence, radicalisation and internet bullying through to female genital mutilation, witchcraft and spirit possession, honour based violence and forced marriage, this book will be a valuable resource for qualified paediatricians and those in training, as well as professionals who have contact with children such as GPs, nurses, health visitors, social workers, midwives, teachers, lawyers, and community
workers." />
