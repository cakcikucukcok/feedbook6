  <title>HCG Diet 800 Calorie Protocol Second Edition - Sonia E Russell, Dean Yannello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Licensed nurse, Sonia Russell, LPN is recognized as a leading expert in hCG diet research and weight loss safety. Many dieters have claimed to be weak, tired, complain of hunger, frequent headaches and hair loss on the original 500 calorie VLCD. The HCG Diet 800 Calorie Protocol was developed from years of patient data obtained in the clinical setting to provide the dieter with a safer, effective and more comfortable plan. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 800 Calorie Protocol includes the use of vitamins and minerals, adding breakfast, more protein sources, an extra fruit serving, and more food choices. The results have shown to yield the same, if not better weight loss when compared to the original 500 calorie protocol. The modified version also includes an improved phase 3 stabilization plan by removing certain foods that many dieters have been known to overindulge upon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The 800 Calorie Protocol teaches the principals of eating clean by prohibiting canned and processed foods, fat free/sugar free store bought foods or products containing preservatives, flavor enhancers, pesticides, herbicides, sugar substitutes, corn syrups or hormones. The dieter will learn healthier ways to grocery shop, read food labels, and prepare and cook healthier foods.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The HCG Diet 800 Calorie Protocol Second Edition contains detailed updates to each phase of the 800 Calorie Protocol including new stall breaking techniques, egg white protein alternatives, approved breakfast protein shakes, updates to the phase 2 food guide, phase 2 allowable water veggies, more delicious phase 2 and 3 recipes, sample menus for phases 2 and 3, a detailed phase 3 stabilization plan, dieter testimonials, all required hCG essentials, updated hCG diet FAQ&amp;#39;s, recommended supplements, calorie counting charts, and exercise routines." />
