  <title>Local Flaps in Head and Neck Reconstruction - Ian T. Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is truly a classic, beloved by plastic surgeons throughout the world. Its strength lies in its simple, elegant approach to solving common reconstructive problems encountered by plastic surgeons at all levels of training. Its appeal transcends specialty interests, with aesthetic and reconstructive surgeons alike finding this book to be an invaluable resource for daily practice. Its comprehensive coverage makes it an essential addition to any surgeon&#39;s library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Totally revised and updated with color throughout, this new edition has been totally revised and updated with over 150 additional pages, two new chapters, and numerous new cases, flaps, and problems. Additionally, there are color illustrations, summary tables highlighting the best flaps for various clinical situations, annotated bibliographies, and much, much more. Throughout these pages, the reader benefits from Dr. Jackson&#39;s enormous experience and wisdom as he makes note of special tips, critical maneuvers, and important principles that warrant emphasis. Each flap is accompanied by a description of potential problems, and each anatomic area for reconstruction ends with a technique of choice so that the reader can understand the decision-making process that is involved in flap selection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The book begins with a chapter on basic principles, which reviews the important oncologic concerns that must precede any reconstructive-surgery procedure. Principles of tissue movement and flap design are accompanied by drawings that aid the reader in planning. The next seven chapters address each anatomic region. Alternate methods for closing defects in each region are presented. Both simple and complex solutions are detailed. Each reconstructive option is presented in great detail with operative photos as well as beautiful illustrations to depict flap design, elevation, and closure, and to more clearly explicate complex flap reconstructions for difficult problems. Common mistakes and the limitations of each flap are clearly delineated. Chapters on each anatomic region conclude with new summary tables that help the reader quickly identify the best reconstructive options for specific problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Totally New Chapters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final two chapters are new to this edition-&lt;em&gt;Tissue Expansion&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Problems and Complication&lt;/em&gt;. The chapter on tissue expansion fully details the advantages to be gained from tissue expansion and the applications in each area of the head and neck when local flaps are planned. The Problems and Complications chapter covers common problems encountered in head and neck reconstruction as well as avoidance and treatment of complications should they occur. It concludes with a section on tricks and innovations, which discusses diverse topics such as the use of scarlet red for wound healing, the aesthetic repair of torn earlobes, and the repair of cocaine-induced palatal fistula. There is clearly a wealth of information and much to be learned and applied by surgeons at all levels of expertise.&lt;/p&gt;" />
