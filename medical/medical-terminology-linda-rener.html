  <title>Medical Terminology - Linda Rener</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This workbook has been developed for all individuals with little to no background in the health care field.  It is a basic introduction to medical terminology.  It provides the student with an opportunity to develop good word-building skills so that the student can identify medical terms by their corresponding word components.
&lt;p&gt;This workbook is unique in that it has been designed for use with any medical terminology textbook or instructor lectures.  It is filled with exercises, crossword puzzles, case studies, and a bonus section with flash cards to assist the student in broadening their knowledge base.  There are special topics such as medical financial terms, which will help familiarize one with the special communication style used by hospitals, medical offices, and insurance companies in medical billing.
&lt;p&gt;The student need not be limited to one pursuing a strictly medical career.  The student of medical terminology may be an accountant, an attorney, a journalist, or an individual from any of the vast array of fields that directly or not deal with the medical profession.  The entry-level health care provider to facilitate in the on-going review of medical terminology can also utilize this book.
&lt;p&gt; In 2012, this workbook became available in e-book format!  Dr. Mundorff is available for personalized online tutoring; contact her at bridges2hlth@aol.com." />
