  <title>Shakespeare&#39;s Tremor and Orwell&#39;s Cough - John J. Md Ross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The doctor suddenly appeared beside Will, startling him. He was sleek and prosperous, with a dainty goatee. Though he smiled reassuringly, the poet noticed that he kept a safe distance. In a soothing, urbane voice, the physician explained the treatment: stewed prunes to evacuate the bowels; succulent meats to ease digestion; cinnabar and the sweating tub to cleanse the disease from the skin. The doctor warned of minor side effects: uncontrolled drooling, fetid breath, bloody gums, shakes and palsies. Yet desperate diseases called for desperate remedies, of course.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Were &lt;b&gt;Shakespeare&lt;/b&gt;&#39;s shaky handwriting, his obsession with venereal disease, and his premature retirement connected? Did &lt;b&gt;John Milton&lt;/b&gt; go blind from his propaganda work for the Puritan dictator Oliver Cromwell, as he believed, or did he have a rare and devastating complication of a very common eye problem? Did &lt;b&gt;Jonathan Swift&lt;/b&gt;&#39;s preoccupation with sex and filth result from a neurological condition that might also explain his late-life surge in creativity? What Victorian plague wiped out the entire &lt;b&gt;Brontë &lt;/b&gt;family? What was the cause of &lt;b&gt;Nathaniel Hawthorne&lt;/b&gt;&#39;s sudden demise? Were &lt;b&gt;Herman Melville&lt;/b&gt;&#39;s disabling attacks of eye and back pain the product of &quot;nervous affections,&quot; as his family and physicians believed, or did he actually have a malady that was unknown to medical science until well after his death? Was&lt;b&gt; Jack London &lt;/b&gt;a suicide, or was his death the product of a series of self-induced medical misadventures? Why did &lt;b&gt;W. B. Yeats&lt;/b&gt;&#39;s doctors dose him with toxic amounts of arsenic? &lt;b&gt;Did James Joyce&lt;/b&gt; need several horrific eye operations because of a strange autoimmune disease acquired from a Dublin streetwalker? Did writing &lt;i&gt;Nineteen Eighty-Four&lt;/i&gt; actually kill &lt;b&gt;George Orwell&lt;/b&gt;?         The Bard meets &lt;i&gt;House, M.D.&lt;/i&gt; in this fascinating untold story of the impact of disease on the lives and works of some the finest writers in the English language. In &lt;i&gt;Shakespeare&#39;s Tremor and Orwell&#39;s Cough&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; John Ross cheerfully debunks old biographical myths and suggests fresh diagnoses for these writers&#39; real-life medical mysteries. The author takes us way back, when leeches were used for bleeding and cupping was a common method of cure, to a time before vaccinations, sterilized scalpels, or real drug regimens. With a healthy dose of gross descriptions and a deep love for the literary output of these ten greats, Ross is the doctor these writers should have had in their time of need.&lt;/p&gt;" />
