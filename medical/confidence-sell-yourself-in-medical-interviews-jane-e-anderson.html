  <title>Confidence: Sell Yourself in Medical Interviews - Jane E Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selling Yourself Matters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You have persevered through nearly a decade of intense study and rigorous training to become a qualified doctor. It takes an incredibly strong intellect and the utmost dedication to get to this point. You know what specialty training program you want to get into and now it&amp;rsquo;s time to nail the final interview &amp;ndash; and this book can show you how.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Panels of Experts are Daunting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Panel interviews can be scary if you&amp;rsquo;re not prepared. The panellists usually show little emotion, which makes it difficult to know if what you&amp;rsquo;re saying is hitting the mark. And when you&amp;rsquo;re unsure, you can feel flustered. Your confidence nosedives. You stumble through your answers to the panellists&amp;rsquo; questions, and you may leave the interview feeling as though you&amp;rsquo;ll have to try again next year, or even apply for another specialty. You can avoid all this turmoil by learning how to sell yourself!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Interview Ready Are You?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You may be concerned about selling yourself too little or too much in the interview. What amount is just right? You don&amp;rsquo;t want to appear boastful or brash, but you also don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out on your training program. This is your chance to achieve a training program in your desired specialty. You don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss out!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;We all hate selling ourselves, but an interview is one of those times when you can&amp;rsquo;t be shy. You have to stand out from the crowd, of course, but there&amp;rsquo;s a way to give the panellists what they want to hear without sounding like you&amp;rsquo;re blowing your own trumpet.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From this book you will learn:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;What the interview panel wants to hear.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Specific clinical, technical skills you need to sell yourself effectively.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;How to craft your answers so they demonstrate that you&amp;rsquo;re the best person for the job.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;A framework to build effective answers to medical behavioural, scenario and ethical questions.&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Techniques to increase your confidence, how to anticipate what questions the panel might ask and how to practice in the lead up to the big day.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Jane Anderson has worked with hundreds of doctors to get onto their dream training position across faculties such as dermatology, surgery, gynaecology, maxillofacial surgery, cosmetic surgery and urology. She has been featured in various national print and television media, speaks at conferences and mentors individuals. She is the host of the number 1 ranked iTunes podcast, the &amp;ldquo;Jane Anderson Brand You Show&amp;rdquo;, and is the author of three books on how to sell yourself. She has also been nominated for the Telstra Business Women&amp;rsquo;s Award in 2014 and 2016.&lt;/p&gt;" />
