  <title>Word of Mouse Marketing for Dentists - James F. Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&amp;#39;ve been there. You have certainly seen it: online reviews and posts designed by the authors to destroy a business. If you haven&amp;#39;t been the victim of such posts, you almost certainly will be. Your online reputation is critical to your practice success, and you need to take active steps to promote and manage an excellent online reputation. Word of Mouse Marketing for Dentists will show you how to establish an ongoing reputation program to protect your practice from online trolls and those patients who are impossible to please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Jim Richardson has written the authoritative resource for both dental startups and established practices built on personal and professional referrals for collecting, managing, and leveraging patient reviews for success. Like it or not, reviews and review sites have the potential to make or break even the most prominent practice. Jim gives dentists a full understanding of what reputation marketing is and how it should and should not be utilized effectively and safely.&amp;rdquo; --Mark Hollis, Practice Management Consultant and co-founder of MacPractice, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Being not only a dentist, but a reputation specialist myself, I certainly understand the value and importance of a dental practice&amp;rsquo;s online reputation. In this book, Word of Mouse Marketing for Dentists, Jim Richardson has written an easy and informative book about improving one&amp;#39;s appearance online. In this day and age, visibility and credibility are two of the things you must have to not only be found online, but to also attract new patients to your practice. When looking for a dentist, one of the very first things a patient will do is search online. Using the advice that Jim provides in his book will help you earn the trust that Google, Yelp, and other directories need to give you the competitive edge. Word of Mouse Marketing for Dentists, is a must read for dentists looking to improve all aspects of their image online.&amp;rdquo; --Leonard F. Tau, DMD, Philadelphia, PA&lt;/p&gt;" />
