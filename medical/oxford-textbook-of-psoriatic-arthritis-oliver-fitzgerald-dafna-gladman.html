  <title>Oxford Textbook of Psoriatic Arthritis - Oliver FitzGerald, Dafna Gladman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Psoriatic arthritis, or PsA, is now acknowledged the second most prevalent and important inflammatory arthropathy worldwide. The addition of this new textbook on PsA is a fitting and important inclusion to the Oxford Textbooks in Rheumatology series, written to reflect the significant advances in the field in recent years.
With the recent advances in the understanding of pathogenesis, and the development of novel therapies, the Oxford Textbook of Psoriatic Arthritis provides a comprehensive overview of the disease. Each chapter is written by leading clinicians and scientists in the field of psoriatic arthritis, to provide a contemporary view of PsA, and a look into the future directions of research. Covering everything from epidemiology and diagnosis to genetics and pathology, detailed sections on
treatment and outcomes provide an invaluable resource for the clinician. The book is also highly illustrated with both clinical images such as x-rays and histological photographs to aid clinical knowledge, and diagrams of the immunology and genetics that underlie the disease.
Practical and all-inclusive, with summary boxes to distil the most important information, the Oxford Textbook of Psoriatic Arthritis will prove an invaluable resource for rheumatologists, dermatologists, trainees, and all members of the multidisciplinary team who are interested in recent advances in PsA." />
