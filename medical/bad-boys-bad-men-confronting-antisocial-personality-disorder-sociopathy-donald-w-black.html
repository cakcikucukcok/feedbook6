  <title>Bad Boys, Bad Men: Confronting Antisocial Personality Disorder (Sociopathy) - Donald W. Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whether called black sheep, sociopaths, con men, or misfits, some men break all the rules. They shirk everyday responsibilities, abuse drugs and alcohol, take up criminal careers , and lash out at family members. In the worst cases, they commit rape, murder, and other acts of extreme violence. What makes these men behave as if they had no conscience?  Bad Boys, Bad Men examines antisocial personality disorder or ASP, the mysterious mental condition that underlies this lifelong penchant for bad behavior. Psychiatrist and researcher Donald W. Black, MD, draws on case studies, scientific data, and current events to explore antisocial behavior and to chart the history, nature, and treatment of a misunderstood disorder that affects up to seven million Americans. Citing new evidence from genetics and neuroscience, Black argues that this condition is tied to biological causes and that some people are simply born bad. Bad Boys, Bad Men introduces us to people like Ernie, the quintessential juvenile delinquent who had an incestuous relationship with his mother and descended into crime and alcoholism; and John Wayne Gacy, the notorious serial killer whose lifelong pattern of misbehavior escalated to the rape and murder of more than 30 young men and boys. These compelling cases read like medical detective stories as Black tries to separate the lies these men tell from the facts of their lives.   For this Revised and Updated edition, Dr. Black includes new research findings, including the most recent work on the genetic and biological determinants of antisocial personality disorder, and he also discusses the difference between, and overlap with, psychopathy. Several new cases have been added to Bad Boys, Bad Men, including Mike Tyson and Saddam Hussein, and he also briefly discusses antisocial women such as Aileen Wuornos, the lead character in the movie, Monster.  Acclaim for the first edition:  For a fascinating and insightful journey inside the criminal mind one could not find a better guide than Dr. Donald Black, one of the worlds leading authorities on the classification of aberrant behaviorsEL. A magnificent achievement. --Jeffrey M. Schwartz, M.D., author of Brain Lock  Clearly written, informative, and filled with intriguing stories of real people....Tells us what we need to know about antisocial personality disorder. A wonderful book. --John M. Oldham, MD, Columbia University   A clear and thorough account of the current scientific understanding of a baffling condition, Bad Boys, Bad Men will appeal to those interested in the origins of repetitive criminal behavior. The book will be of especial use to the families of the antisocial. --Peter D. Kramer, author of Listening to Prozac  A tour de force. Don Black has distilled decades of his clinical experience and a comprehensive review of research on antisocial personality disorder into the definitive vade mecum on the topic. --John H. Greist, M.D., Clinical Professor of Psychiatry, University of Wisconsin Medical School" />
