  <title>Electrophysiological Foundations of Cardiac Arrhythmias - Andrew L. Wit, Hein J. Wellens, Mark E. Josephson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book teaches the fundamental concepts of cardiac 
electrophysiology with an emphasis on the relationship of basic 
mechanisms to clinical arrhythmias. Understanding this relationship and 
the underlying mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis will be valuable to 
medical students in general and physicians entering the fields of 
cardiology and clinical electrophysiology, as well as those scientists 
and clinicians already working in this field.&lt;/p&gt;The book is divided 
into three parts that cover the major mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis: 
Part I – Automaticity, Part II – Afterdepolarizations and Triggered 
Activity, and Part III – Abnormal Impulse Conduction and Reentry. Each 
part starts with a chapter that describes the basic science principles 
related to that particular mechanism. Topics include: impulse initiation
 and rate control, membrane currents, conduction, and the effects of 
programmed electrical stimulation and pharmacologic agents. Subsequent 
chapters in each part are organized around examples of clinical 
arrhythmias and then focus on the relevant EP mechanisms and the 
characteristic responses to interventions. The characteristics of the 
three different mechanisms are compared and contrasted throughout the 
text.&lt;p&gt;Throughout
 the book, the aspects of basic EP mechanisms and examples from EP 
studies and pharmacologic interventions are paired with clinical 
examples. The end result is enhanced understanding of how EP mechanisms 
and testing relate to arrhythmogenesis in a way that can be applied 
broadly to a variety of situations in a clinical setting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This definitive book also includes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than 300 figures, including ECGs and original diagrams that illustrate essential electrophysiology concepts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Case
 studies of clinical arrhythmias with explanations of how ECG 
characteristics and the responses to electrical stimulation denote 
arrhythmogenic mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;" />
