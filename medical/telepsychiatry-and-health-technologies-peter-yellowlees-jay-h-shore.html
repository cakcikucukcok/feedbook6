  <title>Telepsychiatry and Health Technologies - Peter Yellowlees, Jay H. Shore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The only current book on the topic, Telepsychiatry and Health Technologies: A Guide for Mental Health Professionals is a practical, comprehensive, and evidence-based guide to patient-centered clinical care delivered in whole or in part by technological devices and applications. Not a technology-centered &quot;health informatics&quot; book, but rather one that describes basic technological concerns and emphasizes clinical issues and workflows, it is designed for psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health clinicians who seek to learn the modes, models, and methods of telepsychiatry. More than 30 practitioners of telepsychiatry across the core mental health disciplines were involved in development of the text, contributing knowledge and clinical examples. Rich with case studies and hands-on guidance, the book introduces strategies, then clearly illustrates how to put them into practice. The editors believe that psychiatry increasingly will focus on the treatment of populations, and that technology offers the best hope of doing so efficiently and effectively.Careful thought went into the book&#39;s conception and design, resulting in a marriage of structure and content that meets the needs of today&#39;s clinicians:   ? The editors employed a unique process of manuscript development, first outlining each chapter in its entirety, then assigning sections to contributors selected for their specific clinical experience and therapeutic expertise. The result is a text that flows logically and creates synergy across chapters without duplication. ? The book provides &quot;how-to&quot; guidance on setting up a new telepsychiatry practice or integrating technologies into a current practice, covering critically important topics such as data collection, security, and electronic health records. ? Technologies addressed include telephony, smartphones, apps, e-mail, secure texting, and videoconferencing, all of which are increasingly being used in the assessment and treatment of patients with psychiatric disorders. ? More than 30 case examples of patients or programs are included, illustrating the range of clinical techniques that can be used and the types of patient that can be treated using available technologies -- whether in person, online, or in a hybrid form of care combining both modalities. ? Every chapter concludes with a summary of major learning objectives or findings covered. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Telepsychiatry and Health Technologies: A Guide for Mental Health Professionals is destined to become a core resource in the training of mental health professionals from all disciplines, as well as an indispensable reference for those already integrating new technologies into their practices.&lt;/P&gt;" />
