  <title>Spagyric Medicine - John Pharamund Rhumelius</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John Pharamund Rhumelius was a German alchemist and physician, and a contemporary of Jan Baptist van Helmont. He was born in Neumark in 1597 and died in Nuremberg in 1661.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Spagyric medicine is a natural method of health care based on medicinal plants.&lt;br /&gt;
More popular in Germany, spagyric remedies, although similar to homeopathy and herbal medicine in many ways, are a unique class of medicine that can be used for a wide variety of health conditions, from acute disease to chronic conditions.&lt;br /&gt;
Spagyric remedies combine the phytotherapeutic effects of botanical medicine with the energetic aspects of homeopathy. The remedies themselves have active biochemical constituents based on their specific herbal, and sometimes homeopathic metal, components. However, the spagyric process itself then potentiates the energetic signature of the plants in much the same way succussion and dilution do in the homeopathic process.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The modality was first coined by Paracelsus, the famous Swiss physician of the 16th century, but continued by brilliant scientists such as Rhumelius." />
