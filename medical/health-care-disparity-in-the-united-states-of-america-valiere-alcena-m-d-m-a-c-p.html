  <title>Health Care Disparity in the United States of America - Valiere Alcena M.D. M.A.C.P.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is written to bring to light the many wrongs that are going on in the health care insurance system in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. health care insurance system is the most expensive health care system in the world and the most inefficient health care system of all the health care systems of other industrial countries in the world. The U.S. health care system is controlled by the HMOs. The HMOs run the health care system for financial gains as their only motives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CEOs of the HMOs device all sort of business models that en-able them and their share holders to pocket the lion share of the 2.3 trillion dollars allocated yearly to pay for this inefficient and costly health care system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They have zero interest in quality patient care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drug companies must also share some of the blames for the problems afflicting the U.S. health care system because, they make drugs that are so expensive and many people cannot afford to pay for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is time for people in the U.S. to demand change and for the government to say enough is enough and come up with new legislation to create a brand new health care system to provide health insurance coverage for all American citizens.&lt;/p&gt;" />
