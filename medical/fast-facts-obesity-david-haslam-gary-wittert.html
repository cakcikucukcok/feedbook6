  <title>Fast Facts: Obesity - David Haslam, Gary Wittert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="“Not to broach the subject of excess weight with a patient is a dereliction of duty as a healthcare professional,” say the authors of Fast Facts: Obesity. “Patients who smoke are rapidly identified for intervention, and the same should be true of anyone who is obese”
Every consultation is an opportunity to educate and encourage patients to pursue better health. Fast Facts: Obesity is packed with practical advice on how best to support patients to improve their nutrition and levels of physical activity, and change their habits, with simple and achievable goals tailored to individual needs and concerns. 
This highly readable handbook also provides a comprehensive overview of:
•	the causes and consequences of obesity
•	the latest information on pharmacological and surgical options 
•	the issues specific to the management of obesity in children, pregnant women and the elderly. 
The authors say: “The opportunity to educate others and exert influence can be leveraged at many levels, even with limited amounts of time.” Reading Fast Facts: Obesity is an excellent starting point for any healthcare professional who wants to understand this major threat to human health and ultimately improve outcomes." />
