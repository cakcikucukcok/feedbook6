It plays an important role in the early detection of breast cancer and in the more eff ective evaluation of breast disease, and has proven to be a reliable method for staging and follow-up after a breast cancer diagnosis. Since there are now dedicated materials available for the performance of percutaneous MRI-guided needle biopsies, it is also possible to obtain a histologic diagnosis of findings that are only detected on MRI.

How does one proceed during the examination?   How does one arrive at a diagnosis precisely and reliably? How can mistakes be   avoided?  &lt;LI&gt; Now over 1300 completely new, high-quality images   produced with the latest equipment   &lt;LI&gt;Summarized characteristics of distinct diseases:   incidence, etiology, malignant potential, clinical and imaging findings  &lt;LI&gt;Inclusion and application of MRI-BIRADS  &lt;LI&gt;In-depth and updated coverage of DCIS&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;&lt;P&gt;This book shows readers how to acquire excellent images and helps improve their image analysis and evaluation skills.
