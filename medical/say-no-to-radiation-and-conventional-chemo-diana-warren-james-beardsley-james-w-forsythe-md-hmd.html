  <title>Say No to Radiation and Conventional Chemo - Diana Warren, James Beardsley, James W. Forsythe Md Hmd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Internationally acclaimed integrative medical oncologist James W. Forsythe, M.D., H.M.D., has praised Diana Warren for courage and tenacity in her arduous
    battle against Stage II breast cancer. Doctor Forsythe insists that Diana deserves kudos from people around the world, for refusing to subject her body to
    unnecessary standard chemo and radiation that unscrupulous allopathic oncologists kept trying to require her to endure. Featured in many hot-selling books
    written by others including media personality Suzanne Somers, and also the author of many successful books himself, Doctor Forsythe has hailed Diana for
    her dogged determination amid a non-stop quest to find effective natural, non-toxic treatments as her health deteriorated, while also hunting for an
    experienced doctor licensed to avoid high-dose poisonous options. I strongly recommend that everyone who suffers from cancer read Dianas compelling
    tale, Doctor Forsythe said. Today, Diana is playing a formidable role in helping to lead the way as a true champion in a quest to inform the public of
    the urgent need to avoid toxic treatments when feasible in certain circumstances, and how to find acceptable natural remediesplus the importance of
    avoiding standard-of-care chemo and radiation when under the care and guidance of a qualified, licensed medical professional. After reading many
    hundreds of books on cancer, Doctor Forsythe hails Dianas publication as being by far among the best from the viewpoint of a person who never attended
    medical school. Readers undoubtedly will benefit when learning of the exceptional example Diana has set for us all.
