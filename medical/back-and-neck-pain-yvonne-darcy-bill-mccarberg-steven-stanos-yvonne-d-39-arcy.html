  <title>Back and Neck Pain - Yvonne DArcy, Bill McCarberg, Steven Stanos, Yvonne D&#39;Arcy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An estimated 60 million Americans suffer from pain. There has been an explosion in pain research, new pharmaceuticals, the recognition of complementary and alternative therapies, interventional techniques and surgery, professional pain societies and providers with expertise in pain management. Still, the most common condition seen in primary care settings and in pain clinics is lower back pain. Despite the high prevalence of back and neck pain in the population, treatment and ongoing management of these conditions continues to pose challenges in various clinical settings. Educational resources for both primary and specialist clinicians alike are needed to address these challenges.   As part of the Oxford American Pain Library, this practical handbook is designed to serve as a concise yet authoritative resource on diagnosing and treating back and neck pain. Co-authored by two primary care physicians and a nurse practitioner with extensive expertise in pain medicine and management, the book is tailored to the needs of busy health care professionals treating patients in the primary care setting, and focuses on essential clinical information for physicians and other healthcare professionals who see patients with these widespread and often debilitating conditions. In addition to covering all aspects of diagnosis, treatmentboth pharmacological and non-pharmacological, and ongoing management of back and neck pain, the handbook also features chapters dedicated to similar conditions of myofascial pain, whiplash and fibromyalgia." />
