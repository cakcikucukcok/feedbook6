  <title>Building a Healthy Child - Melina Roberts, N.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Melina Roberts, N.D., has developed a revolutionary program that introduces infants and toddlers to food that helps them develop their bodies and health.&lt;p&gt; 
Many parents feed their children as if theyre adults, without ever thinking that perhaps they should not be eating like a fully-grown adult. The truth is, however, that organs and body systems mature at different times, which means nutrition needs at different ages vary.&lt;p&gt;
In this guidebook to promoting optimal health in infants and toddlers, youll learn how to:&lt;p&gt;
take advantage of the benefits of breastfeeding;&lt;p&gt;
avoid foods that can cause infants problems, such as grains, wheat, soy, corn, refined white sugar, and cows milk;&lt;p&gt; 
introduce solids to infants and toddlers;&lt;p&gt; 
decrease the likelihood of children developing allergies, eczema, asthma, and chronic disease. &lt;p&gt;
Most parents want to give their children a head start in life, but they too often neglect the most important areanutrition. They introduce certain foods too early and feed their children poor-quality food, promoting a disastrous cycle of bad health.&lt;p&gt;
Help your children develop into intelligent, successful, and healthy adults with the insights and guidance in &lt;em&gt;Building a Healthy Child&lt;/em&gt;." />
