  <title>The Cure of Imperfect Sight by Treatment Without Glasses - William Horatio Bates</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Cure of Imperfect Sight by Treatment Without Glasses by William Horatio Bates. A brilliant book written by an eye-surgeon for the masses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book contains findings after decades of research and experimental work into various eye disorders. Even though he expected to find some errors in the old theories and beliefs used for the past 150 years, he was amazed at his own discoveries and the effect they had for the treatment of defective vision.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bates graduated A.B. from Cornell University in 1881 and received his medical degree at Columbia University&amp;#39;s College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1885. He formulated a theory about vision health, and published the book Perfect Sight Without Glasses in 1920. Parts of Bates&amp;#39; approach to correcting vision disorders were based on psychological principles, which were contrary to many of the medical theories of the time and remain so. The Bates Method still enjoys some limited acceptance as a modality of alternative medicine." />
