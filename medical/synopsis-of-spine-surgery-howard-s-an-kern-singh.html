  <title>Synopsis of Spine Surgery - Howard S. An, Kern Singh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;body&gt;The third edition of this concise, essential spine handbook expands on the previous edition, reflecting recent advances in the field. Written by highly renowned spine surgeons, the new edition is presented in full color with the addition of several hundred exquisitely crafted illustrations. Portable but comprehensive, this book offers a well-rounded perspective on surgical and nonsurgical management of spine-related conditions and disease in adult and pediatric patients. In the opening chapters, a solid clinical foundation is laid &amp;#8211; covering anatomy, physical examination, imaging and diagnostic testing, biomechanics of the spine, and instrumentation. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Clinical information is summarized in an outline format, enabling readers to peruse broad topics in an expeditious manner. Chapters are categorically arranged, encompassing cervical, thoracic and lumbar spine pathologies. Within the framework of trauma, degenerative changes, congenital conditions, tumors, and infections &amp;#8211; topics include spinal cord injury, thoracolumbar spine fractures; lumbar disk disease, stenosis, and spondylolisthesis; and spinal deformities in children and adults. Rounding out the volume are chapters on tumors, infections, and immune disorders that impact the spine such as rheumatoid arthritis and seronegative spondyloarthropathies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Key features:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;New chapters on surgical positioning and neuromonitoring&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Updates on minimally invasive surgical techniques, bone physiology, and biologics&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More than 300 beautiful illustrations presented in full-color &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Key references offer more in-depth insight on topics &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Succinct layout enables cover-to-cover reading and study prep for board examinations&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;This handy resource is small enough to carry around during rounds and is particularly useful for orthopaedic surgeons and neurosurgeons in training. The reader-friendly format also makes it an excellent reference book for practicing spine surgeons and practitioners involved in the nonsurgical management of spine conditions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/body&gt;" />
