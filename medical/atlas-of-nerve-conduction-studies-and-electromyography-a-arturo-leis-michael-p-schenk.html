  <title>Atlas of Nerve Conduction Studies and Electromyography - A. Arturo Leis, Michael P. Schenk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Beautifully and lavishly illustrated, Atlas of Nerve Conduction Studies and Electromyography demystifies the major conditions affecting peripheral nerves and provides electrodiagnostic strategies for confirming suspected lesions of the peripheral nervous system.   Building on the success of the landmark Atlas of Electromyography, this new text is divided into sections based on the major peripheral nerves. It contains detailed illustrations of each nerve along with a discussion of its anatomy, followed by a thorough outline of the clinical conditions and entrapment syndromes that affect the nerve, including a list of the etiologies, clinical features, and electrodiagnostic strategies used for each syndrome. Routine and special motor and sensory nerve conduction studies are shown in an anatomical illustration. In addition, each muscle supplied by the peripheral nerve is illustrated showing the root, plexus, and peripheral nerve supply to the muscle and is accompanied by a corresponding human photograph. Written text provides information about the nerve conduction studies, muscle origin, tendon insertion, voluntary activation maneuver, and the site of optimum needle insertion, which is identified in the figures by a black dot or a needle electrode.   Atlas of Nerve Conduction Studies and Electromyography is the perfect anatomical guide for neurologists, specialists in physical medicine and rehabilitation, and electrodiagnostic medicine consultants, while also providing support for individuals in residency training programs, critical care medicine, neurological surgery, and family practice." />
