Roy Martina, MD, bestselling author of Emotional Balance
Four years ago, my fibromyalgia symptoms forced me to retire from medical practice. Thanks to Ellen Cutlers treatments, the guaifenesin protocol, and acupuncture, my health is so much better. I have been able to return to practice medicine as a fibromyalgia consultant, and I feel blessed to be able to continue my recovery with the help of Dr. Cutlers digestive enzymes and clearing treatments.
Melissa Congdon, MD, fibromyalgia consultant
If you are one of the millions of people who suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, Crohns Disease, colitis, Hashimotos thyroiditis, candidiasis, sinusitis, hay fever, environmental illnesses, and other autoimmune disorders and sensitivities, youve probably tried a myriad of treatments just trying to gain control of your life. 
Clearing the Way to Health and Wellness presents the Ellen Cutler Method (ECM), an innovative technique that offers hope for those for whom other treatments have failed. It provides an empowering new explanation of allergies and sensitivities as the cause of chronic illness, as well as a groundbreaking approach to overcoming them. Allergies and sensitivities can be reduced or eliminated, not miraculously and instantaneously, but inevitably and permanently. 
With contributions from Dr. Richard Tunkel, Dr. Ellen Cutler outlines the relationships among allergies, sensitivities, and chronic health and autoimmune disorders, guiding both patients and health-care practitioners in identifying and eliminating sensitivities that trigger symptoms. Case studies and personal stories illustrate how this powerful new approach has ended the suffering for thousands of all ages without the use of drugs." />
