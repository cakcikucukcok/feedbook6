  <title>Wheel - Sylvia Hawthorn-Deppen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Yes, today she feeds the goose that lays the golden eggs!  But her life once read like a mystery, because for forty-five years she had spasms of the face and neck, her head would ring and, most baffling of all, she had an ache deep in her chest like she was having a heart attack. Unbeknownst to her family, she lived with depression from the age of ten, until finally ending up in a psychiatrists little crash pad shortly after having a beautiful little girl. From here she began a quest to try to do herself inshe tried six times! Then it finally became apparent she was living with chronic pain, and a sublime head injury that kept her from accomplishing her quest of a nursing career. 
Then, in 2002, at the age of fifty-four, she finally threw up her arms and became willing to do whatever it took to get her life back. She began the twelve-step process of recovery that would open her life to healing. She soon found herself, strangely, thanking God for her affliction. Then, one day in June of 2002, she decided to live. 
Today she still has the pain but no longer suffers. Now it is a blessing to have lived, because her life has become part of one very big, ongoing miracle, a miracle of which you, the reader, are a part." />
