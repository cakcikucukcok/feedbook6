  <title>Creating the Health Care Team of the Future - Sioban Nelson, Maria Tassone, Brian D. Hodges</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;One way to significantly improve the delivery of health care is to teach the health professionals who provide care to work together, to communicate with each other across professional boundaries, and to start to think and act like a team that has the patient at its center. The team-based care movement is at the heart of major changes in medical education and will become an element in the new accreditation standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through its Centre for Interprofessional Education, the pioneering approach in this area taken by the University of Toronto has attracted international attention. The role of the Centre for IPE, a formal partnership between the University of Toronto and the Toronto Academic Health Sciences Network, is to create a hub for the university and the many teaching hospitals where all core parties can be actively engaged in redesigning this new model of health care.
