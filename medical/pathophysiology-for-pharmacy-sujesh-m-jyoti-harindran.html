  <title>Pathophysiology for Pharmacy - Sujesh M, Jyoti Harindran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book will serve as an excellent supplement to class notes as it specifically pin points what all can be written in the best way so as to fit as an answer to a question. It has been a credible attempt to condense out the needed and keep away the unwanted. But this does not mean that other textbooks or reference books are unwanted. The book is equally useful for B.Pharm students, Pharm D students, Practicing pharmacists, Pharmacy teachers and Working Pharmacists and even other paramedical students. The courtesy goes to the immense help we got from the readily available internet services to give a wider choice to collect and select matter including valuable diagrams which have made understanding Pathophysiology better. Hope that it is well received and will serve the purpose for which it is meant and for whom it is meant." />
