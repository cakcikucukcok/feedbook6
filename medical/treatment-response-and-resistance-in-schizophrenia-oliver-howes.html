  <title>Treatment Response and Resistance in Schizophrenia - Oliver Howes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Treatment resistant schizophrenia (TRS) is common, affecting approximately a third of patients diagnosed. Despite the prevalence of TRS, the best approach to practical management is often unclear to clinicians and patients.
Treatment Response and Resistance in Schizophrenia offers a practical, clinically focused guide to TRS and the real-world challenges faced by those impacted. Over 14 chapters this resource covers the principles and practice of TRS, from the definition, epidemiology, and clinical assessment, to the pharmacological, physical, and psychological management of treatment resistance.
All chapters have been written by internationally leading experts in the field to ensure busy clinicians have high-quality, applicable content that is rooted in real clinical experiences. A chapter of case studies is included to link real-life scenarios to each of the instructive chapters, illustrating approaches to practical management and application.
Part of the Oxford Psychiatry Library, this useful pocket book is an invaluable resource and quick reference for psychiatrists, psychiatry trainees, and other mental health practitioners, as well as clinical psychologists, primary care physicians, and specialist nurses." />
