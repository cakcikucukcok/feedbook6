  <title>Cancerland - David Scadden, Michael D&#39;Antonio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;An Amazon Best of the Month Book&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;For all the insight he offers into the hard science and thorny logistics of studying cancer, Dr. Scadden&#39;s most moving passages consider the effect of the disease on the people who suffer from it and those who care for them.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;--&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;A doctor&#39;s riveting story of loss and hope in the world of cancer.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What is it like to encounter cancer? How does it feel to face the unknown, to enter a world of hope, loss, and dread?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the diagnosis of his childhood friend&#39;s mother to his poignant memories in the lab, David Scadden&#39;s seen the unknown world of cancer from the lens of a young boy, a classmate, a researcher, a friend, a doctor, and a neighbor. Scadden chronicles his personal memories of cancer - his visits to his sick neighbor and his classmate who left school and never came back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now Dr. David Scadden, co-founder of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute and one of the world&#39;s leading experts on immunology and oncology, writes his memoir, &lt;i&gt;Cancerland&lt;/i&gt;, with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Michael D&#39;Antonio. With riveting stories and moving compassion, Scadden and D&#39;Antonio paint a still rapidly changing landscape in the context of all too common stories of loss. Ranging from Scadden&#39;s personal childhood memories to his triumphs and regrets as a doctor, Scadden illuminates a light at the end of a dark tunnel.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through opening a window into the science of medicine in the world of the unknown, Scadden and D&#39;Antonio humanize cancer while inspiring action that we all so desperately need.&lt;/p&gt;" />
