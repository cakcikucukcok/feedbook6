  <title>Craniomaxillofacial Buttresses: Anatomy and Operative Repair - Richard A. Pollock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Buttresses are the basis for reduction and repair of craniomaxillofacial fractures and are essential for determining the optimal location, for placement of reparative plates and screws. &lt;em&gt;Craniomaxillofacial Buttresses: Anatomy and Operative Repair&lt;/em&gt; endorses surgical anatomy as a basis for operative intervention.Special Features:Buttresses is the first book to coalesce the expertise of the five specialties involved in craniomaxillofacial (CMF) reconstruction after trauma - plastic surgery, oculoplastic surgery, otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, ophthalmology, and neurosurgery.Parallels between architecture and CMF anatomy; basic biomechanics; and advanced finite analysis depict the distribution of impact (load-forces to-and-from the craniofacial skeleton) and the modern principles of operative repairA recurring, two-part format provides continuity, from chapter to chapter. Part 1 identifies the anatomy of a specific CMF region; Part 2 serially depicts clinical presentation, radiographic evaluation, modern techniques of operative repair, and potential collateral damage. Algorithms and illustrations, by renowned artist William Winn, reinforce a logical sequence of clinical management.Compelling preoperative, intra-operative, and postoperative photographs and supplemental text illustrate exemplary repair.Key References for repair of each anatomic region are especially helpful, when managing complex injuries; Additional Biography allows the reader to efficiently further delve, in select cases.From the frontal boss to the lower jaw, this book is one-of-a-kind and brings together history, applied surgical anatomy, and operative techniques in the CMF region, in a way not seen since the classic by Reed O. Dingman and Paul Natvig,  in 1964. An educational reference for medical students, residents, fellows, and clinicians, Craniomaxillofacial Buttresses: Anatomy and Operative Repair simplifies board review-and-study.&lt;em&gt;From the foreword I by Robert M. Goldwyn, MD: [The text is] gracefully written  every word has been chosen carefully. Seldom is a reader fortunate enough to find and learn from a book so much, so effortlessly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;From the foreword II by Paul M. Manson, MD: There are no facial fracture texts in any of the five specialties that deal with facial injury in this amount of detail; nor do they cover all of the craniofacial areas of modern interest, as does this text.&lt;/em&gt;" />
