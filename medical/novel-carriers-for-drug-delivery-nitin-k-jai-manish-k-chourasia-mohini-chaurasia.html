  <title>Novel Carriers for Drug Delivery - Nitin K. Jai, Manish K. Chourasia,  Mohini Chaurasia </title>
      <meta name="description" content="Recent biological discoveries have elevated the understanding and management of various diseases by pinpointing their etiologic progression. Unfortunately though, despite making rapid strides in the science of drug delivery, substantial gaps still exist in realizing the full potential of the newly acquired biologic background into clinically viable therapeutic modalities. Keeping abreast with these advances thus becomes highly essential for professionals engaged in healthcare and pharmaceutical disciplines, in order to instigate translational research capable of fulfilling the clinical void. In an attempt to facilitate this requirement, a short compendium of advanced drug delivery tools has been amassed in current book. Keeping in mind the target audience stress has been laid on usage of simple language, appealing artistic illustrations and schematic flow charts to aptly convey the basic concepts, manufacturing techniques, scale-up methodologies, characterization tools, advantages, drawbacks and applications of various novel drug carriers in a very systemic and concise manner. Interactions of various drug delivery systems with the targeted biological machinery and the consequently elicited toxicological aspects have also been contextually discussed. It is anticipated this handy text book will cater to a wide scientific population seeking information about novel drug carriers." />
