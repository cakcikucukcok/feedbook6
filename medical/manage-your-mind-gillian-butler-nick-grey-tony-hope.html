  <title>Manage Your Mind - Gillian Butler, Nick Grey, Tony Hope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Manage Your Mind is a book for building resilience, overcoming emotional difficulties and enabling self-development. It is for any of us who wish to understand ourselves better, to be more effective in day-to-day life, or to overcome current problems; or who want to support others in these tasks. The authors have, between them, almost 100 years of experience of helping people through difficult times. This experience, together with the results from scientific
research, leads to Manage Your Mind distilling effective techniques and ideas so that readers can select those that suit their preferences and needs. The book explains and illustrates how to respond skilfully to life&#39;s challenges.
The first part of the book helps us gain a better understanding of ourselves and provides tools for clarifying what we most value in life. It highlights the benefits of the practice of acceptance and kindness, and shows how to build self-esteem and self-confidence.
The second part of the book presents practical tools and methods for making our way in the world that are relevant to everyone. This includes the importance of perspective and how we can best use our thinking skills. It also covers everyday topics such as the value of useful habits, time management, looking after our physical health, and increasing happiness, well-being and creativity. The final section focuses on how to develop and maintain good relationships.
The third part of the book provides evidence-based approaches to overcoming specific emotional difficulties, such as worry, panic, low mood, anger, addictions, and coping with trauma, loss and chronic ill health.
With well over 200,000 copies sold, Manage Your Mind remains the definitive self-help guide for anyone seeking to lead a more fulfilling and productive life." />
