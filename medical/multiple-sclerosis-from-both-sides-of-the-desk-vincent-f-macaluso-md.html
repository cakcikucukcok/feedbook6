  <title>Multiple Sclerosis from Both Sides of the Desk - Vincent F. Macaluso Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Macaluso has written the Iliad and the Odyssey of multiple sclerosis while playing the part of Odysseus. Amazing!
Carlo Tornatore, MD, Vice Chairman, Department of Neurology
Georgetown University Hospital, Washington, DC
Vincent F. Macaluso was in medical school when he got the news: he had multiple sclerosis.
He soon learned that almost a half million people in the United States have multiple sclerosisand millions more worldwide. Many have obvious symptoms, such as trouble with walking, balance, and coordination, but the most insidious aspect of the disease is how it affects the mind.
Macaluso shares insights from his vantage point as a doctor and an MS patient, helping his peers understand symptoms they may not grasp and offering wisdom for those who live with the disease. Learn how to
	anticipate and overcome problems concentrating;
	manage swirling emotions;
	understand MS from a neurological standpoint;
	preserve and continue to enjoy an active sex life; and
	prevent the disease from ruining family life.
Laced with humor and filled with diagrams and the authors own recollections about how hes kept MS from controlling his life, this account is essential reading for doctors, patients, and anyone who has an MSer in his or her  life." />
