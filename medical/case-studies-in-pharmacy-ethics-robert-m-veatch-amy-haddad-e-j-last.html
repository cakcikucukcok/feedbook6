  <title>Case Studies in Pharmacy Ethics - Robert M. Veatch, Amy Haddad, E.J. Last</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Pharmacists constantly face ethical choices -- sometimes dramatic matters of life-and-death decisions, but more often subtle, less conspicuous choices that are nonetheless important. &lt;em&gt;Case Studies in Pharmacy Ethics&lt;/em&gt; identifies and discusses the broad range of ethics issues pharmacists confront in practice. Ranging from situations faced in direct patient care to broader issues, this book uses cases to explore topics and the ethical framework within which practitioners make decisions about such issues as assisted suicide, conscientious refusal, pain management, and confidentiality as well as the equitable distribution of drug resources within institutions or managed care organizations and clinical studies on vulnerable populations.
As the scope of the pharmacist&#39;s role expands, pharmacists find themselves facing new ethical challenges. This third edition accounts for some of the many changes in pharmacy practice and in the delivery of health care since the second edition. It includes an entirely new chapter on health insurance and health system planning, and a discussion of the impact of the Affordable Care Act and cases that are updated to reflect current pharmacy practice models. It serves as a valuable resource regarding topics that are both specific to pharmacy practice and those that involve the health care system more generally." />

    	<p>Pharmacists constantly face ethical choices -- sometimes dramatic matters of life-and-death decisions, but more often subtle, less conspicuous choices that are nonetheless important. <em>Case Studies in Pharmacy Ethics</em> identifies and discusses the broad range of ethics issues pharmacists confront in practice. Ranging from situations faced in direct patient care to broader issues, this book uses cases to explore topics and the ethical framework within which practitioners make decisions about such issues as assisted suicide, conscientious refusal, pain management, and confidentiality as well as the equitable distribution of drug resources within institutions or managed care organizations and clinical studies on vulnerable populations. As the scope of the pharmacist's role expands, pharmacists find themselves facing new ethical challenges. This third edition accounts for some of the many changes in pharmacy practice and in the delivery of health care since the second edition. It includes an entirely new chapter on health insurance and health system planning, and a discussion of the impact of the Affordable Care Act and cases that are updated to reflect current pharmacy practice models. It serves as a valuable resource regarding topics that are both specific to pharmacy practice and those that involve the health care system more generally.</p>
