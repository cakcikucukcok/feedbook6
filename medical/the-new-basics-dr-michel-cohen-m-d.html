  <title>The New Basics - Dr. Michel Cohen, M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michel Cohen, named by the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; as the hip, &quot;must-have&quot; pediatrician, has an important message for parents: Don&#39;t worry so much. In an easy-reference alphabetical format, &lt;em&gt;The New Basics&lt;/em&gt; clearly lays out the concerns you may face as aparent and explains how to solve them -- without fuss, without stress, and without harming your child by using unnecessary medicines or interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With sensitivity and love, Dr. Michel describes proven techniques for keeping your children healthy and happy without driving yourself crazy. He will show you how to set positive habits for sleeping and eating and how to treat ailments early and effectively. You&#39;ll learn when antibiotics are helpful and when they can be harmful. If you&#39;re having trouble breast feeding, pumping, or bottle weaning, Dr. Michel has the advice to set you back on track. If after several months your baby is still not sleeping through the night, &lt;em&gt;The New Basics&lt;/em&gt; will provide you with tried-and-true methods to help ease this difficult transition for babies and parents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Michel recognizes that you&#39;re probably asking the same questions his own patients&#39; parents frequently ask, so he includes a section called &quot;Real Questions from Real Parents&quot; throughout the book. You&#39;ll find important answers about treating asthma, head injuries, fevers, stomach bugs, colic, earaches, and other ailments. More than just a book on how to care for your child&#39;s physical well-being, &lt;em&gt;The New Basics&lt;/em&gt; also covers such parenting challenges as biting, hitting, ADD, separation anxiety, how to prevent the terrible twos (and threes and fours ...), and preparing your child for a new sibling.&lt;/p&gt;" />
