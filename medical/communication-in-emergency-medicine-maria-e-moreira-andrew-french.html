  <title>Communication in Emergency Medicine - Maria E. Moreira, Andrew French</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Widely varying patient needs, a wide provider mix, significant power differentials, and a heightened emotional state all contribute to barriers in communication in the medical field and all of these elements are magnified in an emergency department. &lt;em&gt;Communication in Emergency Medicine &lt;/em&gt;highlights key challenges to effective communication in Emergency Medicine that may be experienced by healthcare providers, students, nurses, and even hospital administrators. The text addresses these pitfalls by demonstrating how a mix of foundational communication techniques and leadership skills can be used to successfully overcome barriers in information exchange highlighted by real-life clinical scenarios with an emphasis on avoidable pitfalls. Chapters explore principles of communication, patient and family interactions, and communications within and outside of the healthcare system, rounding off with a number of case studies. The approach of utilizing the environment of an emergency department with high stakes conflicts faced every day by medical professionals distinguishes &lt;em&gt;Communication in Emergency Medicine&lt;/em&gt; as an ideal resource for Emergency Medicine providers, with lessons which can also be applied in many other settings as well." />
