      <meta name="description" content="The Oxford Handbook of Dialysis is a comprehensive and practical guide to all aspects of dialysis, the management of patients with end stage kidney disease, and all its complications. The fourth edition has been completely updated, and covers all aspects of dialysis from haemodialysis techniques and haemodiafitration,  to the medical, nursing and psychosocial aspects of managing patients with end stage kidney failure. 
Renal transplantation, plasma exchange, palliative care, and drug dosing are discussed, along with end of life care, and comnplications of chronic kdney disease. This handbook is packed with practical guidance and management, presented in a compact and easy to use format. The Oxford Handbook of Dialysis is aimed at all health care professionals dealing with dialysis patients from nephrologists to dieticians, as well as pharmacists, nurses, and surgeons. There are specific chapters on
nursing patients on haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis, and detailed nutrition and drug prescribing chapters. 
The fourth edition includes new sections on renal replacement therapies in acute kidney injury, home dialysis, new peritoneal dialysis fluids, new drugs including new epoietins and phosphate binders, updated sections on nocturnal dialysis, dialysis monitoring, encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis, sleep disorders, etc. The handbook is easy to read, very practical, and focussed, with individual topics covered on one or two pages. This book should have a home in every renal unit, dialysis centre,
renal ward, and be close to hand for every nephrologist, renal trainee, or renal nurse." />
