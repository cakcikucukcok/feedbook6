  <title>Clinical Cardiology: Current Practice Guidelines - Demosthenes G. Katritsis, Bernard J. Gersh, A. John Camm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Clinical Cardiology: Current Practice Guidelines Updated Edition is an essential tool for the busy clinician, offering succinct yet detailed access to the most recent trial and guideline data supporting practice and patient management in cardiology.
ESC and ACC/AHA guidelines are continually updated and often overlap in their advice, making it difficult for the cardiologist to obtain a clear picture of the right way to diagnose and treat disease according to the latest evidence base. Written by leading authorities in the field, this book, together with its regularly-updated online version, provides a unique solution.
The authors have scrutinized all available guidelines and research from both ACC/AHA and ESC on every clinical issue. The result is a rigorous examination of the implications of published guidance, illustrated by more than 600 easy-to-follow tables and 200 full-colour images, which reinforce key points and clarify difficult concepts.
87 comprehensive chapters explore the definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis and management of cardiac disease. Two new chapters examine the univentricular heart and venous thrombembolism. Each chapter encompasses the latest published research, followed by discussions of possible presentations and investigations, offering detailed insights for clinicians into best practice for diagnosis and treatment.
Providing at-a-glance access to the best guidance in cardiology, this book offers a diagnosis and management toolkit which no practising cardiologist can afford to be without." />
