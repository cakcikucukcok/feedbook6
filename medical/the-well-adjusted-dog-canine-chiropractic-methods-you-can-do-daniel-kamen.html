  <title>The Well Adjusted Dog: Canine Chiropractic Methods You Can Do - Daniel Kamen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chiropractors and their human patients already know the health benefits of relieving spinal nerve pressure. Dog owners and trainers who are fortunate enough to find a trained animal chiropractor also know of these benefits. But that&#39;s the problem--finding a practitioner in your area. Very few veterinarians offer chiropractic services since they are too busy with medical emergencies. And most of the licensed human chiropractors, who became certified in animal chiropractic, are prohibited or severely limited by law to adjust animals in their state. &lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Well Adjusted Dog: Canine Chiropractic Methods You Can Do&lt;/i&gt; will give dog owners insight on how a lot of the adjustments are performed and what to expect when they take their dog to an animal chiropractor--if they can find one.   &lt;br&gt;For those who want to adjust their own dogs, the author provides step-by-step instructions with over 90 illustrations. However, Dr. Kamen strongly advises first consulting with a licensed veterinarian for a proper evaluation and to rule out any possible contraindications to adjusting.  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;About the Author&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dr. Daniel Kamen was born in Chicago, Illinois and has been practicing chiropractic since 1981. His father is a highly respected anesthesiologist; his mother, a gifted artist. Dr. Kamen&#39;s original animal chiropractic organization, &quot;Animal Crackers,&quot; produced animal chiropractic educational materials, which taught others how to adjust dogs and horses. &lt;br&gt;Dr. Kamen lives with his wife, Sharon, of thirty-four years. Together they have three sons, Jeffrey, Gary and Kevin. He makes his home in Buffalo Grove, Illinois. Dr. Kamen has been featured in many TV, radio, and newspaper stories concerning his work with animal chiropractic. He currently is on tour, teaching a professional as well as a lay lecture seminar on animal chiropractic (horse and dog adjusting). His hobbies include playing the piano and chess (master level). Books by Daniel Kamen include: &lt;i&gt;The Well Adjusted Dog, The Well Adjusted Horse, The Well Adjusted Cat&lt;/i&gt; and a novel entitled &lt;i&gt;Stagecoach Road: The Bullies Must Die&lt;/i&gt;." />
