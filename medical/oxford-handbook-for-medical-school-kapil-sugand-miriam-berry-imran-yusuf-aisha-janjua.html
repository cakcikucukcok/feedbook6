      <meta name="description" content="Medical school is full of unfamiliar and often frightening experiences for students. In the first year, a student must move away from home, balance personal finances, assimilate large volumes of information, learn practical skills, pass high stakes exams, and face a range of unique experiences. The Oxford Handbook for Medical School provides an essential, practical guide for all students, whether you have just received your offer, you&#39;re eager to succeed on
the wards, or you&#39;re about to start your final exams.
This handbook includes quick-access summaries covering the crucial information for your preclinical years and for each clinical specialty. With bullet lists of the key information you need to know, and helpful mnemonics throughout, this is a concise yet thoroughly comprehensive guide.
Written by a team of recent students, now successfully graduated and embarking on their careers, this book will be your closest companion right up to graduation. More than a survival guide, it will help you navigate the bewildering range of opportunities medical school offers, showing you how to make the most of your time, so you are fully prepared for your future career." />
