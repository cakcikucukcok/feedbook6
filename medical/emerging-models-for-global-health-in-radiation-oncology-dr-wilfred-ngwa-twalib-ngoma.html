  <title>Emerging Models for Global Health in Radiation Oncology - Dr Wilfred Ngwa, Twalib Ngoma</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In response to the growing global health challenge in the fight against cancer, there is now a greater need for radiation oncology health professionals across institutions to collaborate and be more globally engaged. Emerging Models for Global Health in Radiation Oncology is a response to the need for a book that comprehensively covers the important and emerging field of radiation oncology. The recent World Health Organization (WHO) Cancer Report describes the growing global burden of cancer as alarming, a major obstacle to human development and well-being, with a growing annual economic cost of ca. US$1.16 trillion. The report also highlights major global cancer disparities, and these major disparities in cancer deaths are in part a reflection of poignant underlying differences in radiation oncology services. In parallel with this, there has been a major recent upsurge in radiation oncology global health interest and a common issue expressed at global health summits, seminars, and symposia is that people want to participate in global health but do not know how. This insightful book highlights the emerging models for global radiation oncology, and serves as a useful resource to facilitate participation and greater effective collaborative global cancer care, research, education, and outreach.? It is suitable for researchers, students, health professionals, and anyone interested in the global oncology community." />
