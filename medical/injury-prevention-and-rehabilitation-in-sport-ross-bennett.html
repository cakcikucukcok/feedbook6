  <title>Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation in Sport - Ross Bennett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Injury Prevention and Rehabilitation in Sport examines the key factors at play in the reduction and prevention of injury to athletes at all levels of sport. The book combines the latest scientific research with a critical review of current literature and the author&#39;s own personal experience working in the field of strength and conditioning at elite level to explain why certain modalities should or should not be prescribed by strength and conditioning coaches. There are full colour sequenced photographs showing the correct techniques for a wide variety of essential strength exercises. Other topics covered include how to effectively manage recovery and avoid overtraining; techniques for range of movement and corrective exercise; the most effective methods for shoulder and trunk stability; the theory and practice of propioception and plyometrics and how they can improve performance; the different methods employed when working with female or maturing athletes and the physiological impact of factors such as sleep patterns, travel, climate and illness on performance. The book concludes with a series of case studies that illustrate how to put theory into practice. Fully illustrated with 110 colour sequenced photographs and diagrams." />
