  <title>How Not To Be A Doctor - John Launer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;Doctor and medical columnist John Launer has  written on the practice and teaching of medicine for many years. Now, more than  fifty of his essays have been collected in How Not to Be A Doctor. Taken  together, they set out an argument that being a doctor--a real doctor--should  mean being able to draw on every aspect of yourself, your interests, and your  experiences, however remote these may seem from the medical task of the moment.Originating  from popular columns Launer has written for medical journals, the essays range  from the title essay &quot;How Not to Be A Doctor,+? an ironic piece illustrating how being authentic as a doctor  may mean behaving in ways you were never taught in medical school, to a story of the imagined conversation between two prehistoric medical  men on the primitive diet, to the author&#39;s poignant account of being a patient  himself as he received treatment for a life-threatening illness.    Some of the essays take the form of short stories, either  imaginary or autobiographical, and some are contemplative in tone, while others are polemical, humorous, educational, fantastical,  satirical, or dead serious. They cover a range of topics including music,  poetry, literature, and psychoanalysis, as well as contemporary medical  politics and the personal experiences of being a doctor. From the absurd to the  profound, the short stories, essays, and reflections in How Not to Be a  Doctor combine erudition with humor, candor, and the human touch to show  how, in medicine, you cannot separate personal experiences from professional  ones, and to inform and entertain readers on both sides of the  stethoscope.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
