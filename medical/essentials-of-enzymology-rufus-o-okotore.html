  <title>Essentials of Enzymology - Rufus O. Okotore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Essentials of Enzymology provides concise information on an important area of the subject,
Biochemistry. This may serve as course material for an advanced treatise in Enzymology
designed for undergraduate science degree programs, especially B.Sc. (Hons ) Biochemistry
and Chemistry.
The book is in 12 chapters which has been divided into four distinct sections, thus (1) Basic
enzyme chemistry and physiology. (2) Enzyme Kinetics, (3) Enzyme catalysis, Mechanisms and
Regulation,(4)Applications of Enzymology. The Part 1 consists of four chapters that deal with
the nature of enzymes- (history, properties and classifi cation), enzyme physiology; structure
of enzymes, and analytical enzymology. Part 2 deals with Enzyme Kinetics which is treated in
three chapters, and Part 3, made up of three chapters discuss Enzyme catalysis, mechanisms
and regulation. Lastly, Part 4 consisting of two chapters deal with the applications of
enzymology.
Signifi cantly, the kinetics of enzyme catalyzed reactions in diverse experimental conditions,
and also under various inhibition types are presented in a simple, mathematical lucid
approach. The mechanisms of action for two atypical proteins-chymotrypsin and lysozyme,
so also the identifi cation of active sites of enzymes by specifi c labels are discussed concisely.
Lastly, the specifi c applications of enzymes in diagnostic medicine, industry, and also the new
emerging area of enzyme biotechnology and enzyme bioinformatics are presented" />
