  <title>More Journeys Down the Path - Edward Neu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book opens with the birth of Sean, the son of Joe and Mary, in this continuing story of Joe, a medical doctor of hematology and his search for the ultimate reason for life here. Throughout the book, Joe suffers occasionally from complications of his sarcoidosis disease with episodes of confusion labeled as encephalopathy.
We follow approximately a year and a half in the life of Joe, Mary, his wife, and Sean and their interactions as a family, but Seans abilities give Joe a lot to think about regarding the nature of our physical existence.
The book ends with another episode of confusion on Joes part due to new bleeding in his gastrointestinal tract. Sean reassures Joe regarding recovery and continued teachings, stating at the end of the book, Dad, I will see you again, and you will see me again. That much I know." />
