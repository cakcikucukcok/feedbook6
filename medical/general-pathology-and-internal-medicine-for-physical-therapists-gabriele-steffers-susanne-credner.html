With this user-friendly book at hand, students and PT practitioners will have the knowledge to identify underlying medical conditions, develop individualized treatment plans that take these factors into account, achieve sound therapeutic goals, and refer patients to other resources where necessary.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special Features:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;li&gt;The only general medicine book for physical therapists written with the in-depth knowledge and experience of practicing MDs&lt;/li&gt;  &lt;li&gt;Organized in two logical sections:  the first, General Pathology, provides a basic foundation in the origin and course of diseases, cardinal signs and symptoms, and diagnostic and therapeutic procedures; the second, Internal Medicine, focuses on anatomy, physiology, and diagnosis of pathologies found in different organ systems, with a concentration on diseases that are treated with physical therapy&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Presents the information in concise summary form but with enough detail to enable PTs to accurately screen and diagnose patients&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Offers nearly 300 full-color, didactic illustrations that serve as a superb visual aid to learning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Includes numerous tables, chapter summaries, a glossary of medical terminology, and dozens of case studies that make every concept clear and accessible&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assists in exam preparation by furnishing dozens of study questions and answers &lt;/li&gt;Now a major part of the curriculum in undergraduate and graduate physical therapy programs, internal medicine and general pathology are part of the basic equipment of the physical therapist.
