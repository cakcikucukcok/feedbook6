  <title>Well-Child Care in Infancy - William B. Pittard Iii, Md, PhD, Mph</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Experimental findings have indicated an association between well-child care and cost-efficient health care and increased school readiness. 
But insurance companies and Medicaid administrators sometimes arent aware of the findings, which is why a book on well-child care is so necessary.
William Pittard, a longtime medical doctor who has spent decades specializing in pediatrics, teams up with other experts to explore how well-child care promotes the health and future success of children in this book for parents, health care providers, policy makers, and others. Learn how:
	Medicaids scope has been broadened to include preventative care;
	confrontations and controversies have led to health care reform;
	legislators and others can take action to improve coverage.
The preventive care the authors focus on includes anticipatory guidance; continuity of care; assessment of growth and development; screening procedures for vision, hearing, dental, and cognitive development; and immunizations. 
By learning more about the health care system and what the latest research tells us about well-child care, youll be better equipped to promote the health and future success of children in a cost-effective way. Thats a win for parents, insurance companies, taxpayers, and most importantlythe next generation." />
