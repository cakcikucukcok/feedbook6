  <title>English for Paramedics - Irena Baumrukov치</title>
      <meta name="description" content="English for Paramedics is a reading book for doctors and medical students whose mother language is other than English and who need to perfect their language skills and professional knowledge at the same time.
	In the first volume the cases concern the following topics: airway and breathing assessment; proper interventions for patients with respiratory compromise; oxygen delivery systems; ventilatory support; respiratory anatomy and physiology; basic airway management; basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation; advanced interventions, cardiology,
	Other casuistics describe medical emergencies (respiratory neurology; endocrinology; allergies/anaphylaxis; gastroenterology; urology; environmental; behavioural; toxicology).
	Further chapters are devoted to trauma, assessment recognition and treatment of various traumatic injuries still others to gynaecology, obstetrics and paediatrics.  	
	The last part of the first volume deals with operations, scene safety; legal considerations; vehicle operations; communications; documentation; infection controlling; quality improvement; DNR; basic patient assessment; basic physiology; hazardous materials; mass casualty incidents; and scene management.
	The second volume is divided into 24 units each of which contains about 20 casuistics. These covers the whole area of emergency services but are not grouped according to their subjects which enables to revise the information in a new and discovering manner.
	Case studies were taken over from materials for self study and testing professional knowledge of future paramedics (see Bibliography). The reading book is suitable for intermediate students but vocabularies at the end of each unit are so detailed than also beginners can use the book and continue in his or her own pace.
	All texts are short, written in actual language and always contain the right answer (marked with *). The method of filling in the right answers is not only popular with students but also very efficient in learning new words in context of well known facts.
	The teachers can find inspiration for further use of casuistics in dialogues and model situations. Some English teachers may find the idea of translating the vocabularies into their own languages interesting which would be a great satisfaction for the author.
	This reading book will be followed soon by English for Paramedics Textbook and Exercise book.
	The author wishes the students a lot of pleasure and success in learning professional medical English.
