  <title>Fast Facts: Bleeding Disorders - David Green, Christopher A Ludlam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most hemorrhagic problems are emergencies, requiring rapid diagnosis and prompt management to stop bleeding. In some cases, such as nose bleeds, large bruises and heavy menses, it is the clinician’s responsibility to discern whether the patient has a clinically significant bleeding disorder that may predispose to excessive or potentially serious bleeding. Fast Facts: Bleeding Disorders keeps a complex subject simple and clinically oriented. The authors have made numerous updates to this second edition to ensure it provides essential information in a readily accessible format. Highlights include:
- An expert overview of normal hemostasis
- A clear assessment pathway, from taking an accurate history and focused clinical examination, to essential laboratory investigations
- Objective criteria for diagnosing hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia
- The latest guidelines on diagnosing and treating primary immune thrombocytopenia 
- A discussion of the benefits of prophylaxis in patients with hemophilia
- Updated methods for evaluating and treating bleeding disorders in pregnancy
- An overview of the scoring system for disseminated intravascular coagulation
- Information on the latest anticoagulants and antithrombotics, including bleeding risks and strategies to control bleeding.
Fast Facts: Bleeding Disorders remains a comprehensive up-to-date reference that reflects the latest research and clinical guidelines. It will assist primary care providers, physician assistants, nurse-clinicians, pharmacists, residents and doctors in training as they confront the challenges of controlling bleeding in patients with hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, platelet disorders and thrombosis, or as a result of antithrombotic or anticoagulant therapy. It is a small book packed with important information, designed to swiftly improve patient treatment and outcomes." />
