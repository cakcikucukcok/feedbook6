  <title>The Transformation - James S. Gordon, M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#160;A world-recognized authority and acclaimed mind-body medicine pioneer presents the first evidence-based program to reverse the psychological and biological damage caused by trauma.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filled with practical tools to alleviate stress, anxiety, fear, and sleeplessness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his role as the founder and executive director of The Center for Mind-Body Medicine (CMBM), Dr. Gordon has created and implemented what may well be the world&amp;#8217;s largest and most effective program for healing population-wide psychological trauma. He and 130 international faculty have brought this program to populations as diverse as refugees from wars in the Balkans, the Middle East, and Africa; firefighters and U.S. military personnel and their families; student/parent/teacher school shooting survivors; and Native American children &amp;#8211; as well as stressed out professionals, stay-at-home mothers, inner-city children, and people struggling with mental and physical disorders and end of life challenges.&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gordon&amp;#8217;s work is grounded in scientific evidence and timeless wisdom. Through his decades of first-hand experience, he understands that trauma will come to all of us sooner or later. That each of us has the capacity to understand and heal ourselves. And that the heartbreaking devastation that trauma&amp;#160;causes can also open our hearts and minds to deeper understanding, enhanced meaning and purpose, and greater love. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the compassionate, compelling pages of &lt;em&gt;The Transformation, &lt;/em&gt;he invites us on a step-by-step, evidence-based journey to heal the psychological and biological damage that trauma brings and to become the people whom we are meant to be. &lt;/p&gt;" />
