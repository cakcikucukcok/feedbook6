  <title>Advanced Respiratory Critical Care - Martin Hughes, Roland Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Respiratory disease is the most common reason for admission to intensive care, and advanced respiratory support is one of the most frequently used interventions in critically ill patients. A clear understanding of respiratory disease is the cornerstone of high quality intensive care. Although a plethora of literature is available, both in print and online, finding the necessary relevant information can be difficult and time consuming. This handbook provides comprehensive clinical detail in an easily readable format. It is written by practising clinicians and has both in-depth theoretical discussion and practical management advice. The book is divided into sections: Section 1 deals with the approach to the patient with respiratory failure - including pathophysiology, investigation and diagnosis Sections 2 covers non invasive treatment modalities Sections 3 and 4 examine invasive ventilation in detail. Section 3 considers the principles of mechanical ventilation while section 4 deals with individual ventilator modes Section 5 discusses the management of the ventilated patient including sedation, monitoring, asynchrony, heart - lung interaction, hypercapnia and hypoxia, complications, weaning and extubation. It also has chapters on areas less frequently covered such as humidification, suction, tracheal tubes and principles of physiotherapy Section 6 is a comprehensive breakdown of each respiratory condition seen in ICU. This book is designed to bridge the gap between Intensive Care starter texts and all-encompassing reference textbooks. It is aimed at consultants and senior trainees in Intensive Care Medicine, senior ICU nursing staff, consultants in other specialties and allied healthcare professionals who have an interest in advanced respiratory critical care." />
