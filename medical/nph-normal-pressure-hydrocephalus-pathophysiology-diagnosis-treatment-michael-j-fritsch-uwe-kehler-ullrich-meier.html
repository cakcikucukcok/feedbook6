  <title>NPH - Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus: Pathophysiology - Diagnosis - Treatment - Michael J. Fritsch, Uwe Kehler, Ullrich Meier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Often misunderstood and misdiagnosed, normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a disease of the elderly that is on the rise as the population ages. Its similarities to Parkinsons disease, dementia and other chronic neurodegenerative conditions make diagnosis challenging, requiring clinicians to be alert to the signs and symptoms that differentiate it. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is the first comprehensive book on the topic, written by experts who have researched and taught courses on NPH for years. From clinical characteristics and pathophysiology to signs and symptoms, radiographic findings, diagnostic tests and state-of-the-art treatment techniques, it covers everything practitioners need to know about this multi-faceted condition. &lt;p&gt;Special Features:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt; Describes the classic symptom triad of gait disturbance, urinary incontinence and dementia &lt;li&gt; Covers the full sequence of the diagnostic work-up, including imaging studies, non-invasive tests, and invasive procedures such as lumbar infusion and cerebrospinal tap tests&lt;li&gt; Explains the risks and benefits of surgical implantation of a ventricular-peritoneal (VP) shunt to relieve symptoms and restore function, including key criteria for evaluating shunt responsiveness &lt;li&gt;Provides the first step-by-step account of operative shunt placement by Dr. Michael Fritsch, who has performed the procedure extensively at leading neurosurgical centers throughout the world&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including troubleshooting techniques following shunt surgery, long-term management of patients, prognosis for the condition and future initiatives, this all-inclusive reference makes a major contribution to the field. It is essential for neurosurgeons, neurologists, internists, residents, and other physicians who treat diseases of the elderly in everyday practice.&lt;/p&gt;" />
