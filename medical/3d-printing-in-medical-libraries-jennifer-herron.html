Additionally, resources for finding medically related models for printing and tips of how to search for models online is also provided, along with resources for creating 3D models from DICOM. Common print problems and troubleshooting tips are also highlighted and lastly, marketing and outreach opportunities are discussed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herron presents the nitty-gritty of 3D printing without getting too technical, and a wealth of recommended resources is provided to support librarians wishing to delve further into 3D printing.
