  <title>Opting In - Amy Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For contemporary women, motherhood has become as polarizing a proposition as it is a powerful calling. For some women this tension is manifest in a debate over whether or not to have children. For others it concerns whether to stay at home with their children or stay in the workforce. Still others feel abandoned altogether by the supposedly pro-family and pro-mother social justice movement that is feminism and are at a loss when it comes to reconciling their maternal instincts with their political beliefs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Opting In&lt;/i&gt;, Amy Richards addresses the anxiety over parenting that women face today in a book that mixes memoir, interviews, historical analysis, and feminist insight. In her refreshingly direct and thoughtful approach, Richards covers everything from the truth about our biological clocks and the trends toward extending fertility, to parenting with nature &lt;i&gt;and &lt;/i&gt;nurturing in mind, to our relationship with our own mothers, to what feminism&#39;s relationship to motherhood is and always has been. Speaking from the vantage point of someone who is both a parent and one of our leading feminist activists, Richards cuts through the cacophony of voices intent on telling women the &quot;appropriate&quot; way to be a mother and reveals instead how to confidently forge your own path while staying true to yourself and your ideals.&lt;/p&gt;" />
