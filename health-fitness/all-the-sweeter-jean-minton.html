  <title>All the Sweeter - Jean Minton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="•	Since 2000, the number of children adopted from the US foster care system bounced around from a low of 50,000 in 2003 to a high of 57,000 in 2009. In 2016, the latest year for which there is published data, 57,208 foster children found their forever families. 
•	Women in the US continue to put off child-bearing until later ages. In 2015, 11 births of every 1,000 were to women between the ages of 40 and 44. This number has doubled since 1990 when it was 5.5. When some women find they are not able to bear children (fertility decreases after age 30 and rapidly declines around age 37-38), adoption becomes a popular option for fulfilling their dream of parenthood. 
•	As interest in adopting children increases, so do the barriers to private domestic adoptions and inter-country adoptions: fewer than 7000 infants (1% of those born between 1996 and 2002) are placed for adoption by never married mothers in the US each year, and intercountry adoptions have dropped drastically since 1999, from a high of 22,989 in 2004 to a low of 5,647 in 2015.
•	The cost of private domestic and international adoption continues to rise. The latest range listed by childwelfare.gov, $15,000 to $50,000, places these adoption options out of financial reach for many. Costs for adopting from the US foster care system, in contrast, are minimal." />
