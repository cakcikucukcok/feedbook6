  <title>College Success - Bob Roth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;All parents want their children to be successful in college. For most, success means that their children graduate from college with a good job or are accepted to &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&quot; /&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;st1:PlaceName w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Graduate&lt;/st1:PlaceName&gt; &lt;st1:PlaceType w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;School&lt;/st1:PlaceType&gt;&lt;/st1:place&gt;. This book is for parents who want to help their children achieve the success they desire in college and beyond. Clearly, there are paths that lead to those two goals, paths that are often unknown or unclear to parents and students alike. For that reason, the author describes and emphasizes the key factors that lead to college, employment and career success. Parents also receive much useful advice on how to help their children capitalize on their natural talents, find their stride and pursue their dreams. The early chapters quickly take readers through the years prior to college, so parents with children who are not yet in college can determine if they are ready and what they need. In fact, some students may benefit from taking a year off after high school. For parents with children about to enter college or already in college, the author has included the information, tools, techniques and suggestions that both parents and students need.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;Parents will learn how students can avoid the ugly side of college life, how students can select their major and career direction, the three areas in which students must excel, the universal success skills students should develop, the 18 myths that students believe, the importance of accomplishments, the value of preparation and much more. Most importantly, parents will learn to play an effective supporting role in student success. Each chapter of this book covers a topic that all college parents should understand and address. With the information provided, parents will have the ability to help their children chart a course that can significantly improve their chances for success, during and after college. &lt;/P&gt;" />
