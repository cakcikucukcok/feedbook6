  <title>The Conscious Planet - Neil M. Pine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The writing of this book was both a spiritual and intellectual journey.
It took more than ten years to complete while having to be revised and
updated constantly. This is no-holds-barred literature where the author
says what he means and means what he says! He does not mintz his words.
The Conscious Planet thinks outside the box and breaks all the rules of
traditional thinking. Sometimes this information can be brutally honest or
painfully real. This author is not trying to win any popularity contest. He
tells it like it really is and doesnt care what anyone thinks!
The Conscious Planet is what the government and big corporations who
control it dont want you to know! It is the truth about the truth and
nothing but the truth, so help me !
In the modern world, people only know what multinational corporations
want them to know, not what they should know! And it is this tainted
knowledge which is creating a society of pathetic drones, who like poor
doomed sheep, are too busy just trying to survive to see that the wool is being
pulled over their eyes while being led to slaughter! Because these corporate
imperatives are being paid for at the expense of the future of mankind!
Before you patronize any product, be conscious about what its doing to
your health, to the earth, and how it will affect future generations.
Skeptics have warned the author that this book will receive nominal
success, that it represents a small niche market, and not everyone would
be interested in such literature. And in retort to this assertion, it should
be acknowledged that yes, it is sadly true that not everyone would be
interested in this book because the information herein may not pertain
directly to their life or general well being. So in understanding, who would
be interested in this book, lets narrow it down by eliminating the types of
individual who would not directly benefit:
x
1. People who are immortal:
Yes, these people might not care about this book: heck, if you
were immortal, you might eat Twinkies and cheese-burgers all
day long.
2. People who have another planet to live on:
This is true: why would they care if the world goes to hell in a hand
basket? See Ya!
Well, lucky them: however, for the other seven billion people who inhabit
the planet earth who are not immortal, and who dont have another
planet to live on then this book is absolutely the most important book
they may ever read!
