  <title>Your Body, Your Genes, Your Digestion, and Your Metabolism - Christopher Brandlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In Christopher Brandlins third book, he explains how our genetics affect our metabolisms and our ability to digest various foods.   In addition to our genetics, our surrounding environments can cause damage to our immune systems.  Due to the rise of the Agricultural Revolution in the United States, more grains have been processed, refined, and became readily available for everyones consumption.   However, research studies have proven that the over-consumption of processed grains has caused an increase in obesity and several autoimmune disorders.  The purpose of this book is to explain how each persons body can be affected by different foods based on their genetics and other surrounding circumstances.  This book also slightly revises some of Mr. Brandlins recommendations from his previous books based on new research." />
