&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lauren has accomplished in Change4Good what few nutritionists and/or personal trainers have: a portable, intelligent and compassionate guide to managing, not just your weight, but your overall wellness and lifestyle attitudes.  That she has done so in a book that engages you at a personal level, unencumbered by calorie-counting, meal plans and hollow mantras, speaks volumes about the depth and breadth of her knowledge, and her passion toward truly helping others attain their wellness goals.  This book is a must read for anyone looking for a refreshing alternative to the all-to-common sterile texts on weight and wellness management.
