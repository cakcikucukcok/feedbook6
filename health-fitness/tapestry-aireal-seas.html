  <title>Tapestry - Aireal Seas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tapestry: The Child Within is a collection of experiences, stories, and lessons as seen through the eyes of the woman who holds this memory of her childhood inside. Therefore, this is not a chronological order of events, but more the woman finding ways to embrace wholeness inside her changing world and path to wellness. 
Who we are and what we become is not about what is done to us, but more about how we use our life experiences and focus to see our own hearts. Perceptions can teach us there are different sides to the same picture we hold in our minds eye. To change our world, we need but change how we perceive our world. As we keep in mind that no matter how sincere a perception is, that perception can be sincerely wrong. 
As we stretch our understanding without lingering, or getting attached to the fears within us, we can become whole and well, as a new innocence and strength takes root within our souls light. 
Tucked in these pages, as if this book was a box of puzzle pieces, you will find many thoughts, memories, parts of a story, and pieces of truths that sometimes seem like they have no connection. But much like clothes hung on a clothesline or birds sitting on a wire, there is one constant connection. That connection is how to be well, and how to heal from within. 
You will find pieces and parts that may touch your heart. May you also find the connection within your own memories, childhood, heart, and soul come together on your own path to defining what healing and being well means to you. As you face your own truths in the light of the sacredness of life, I hope you will be well. When in doubt, I trust you may step back and see the bigger picture and just how amazing and wonderful you and your story are." />
