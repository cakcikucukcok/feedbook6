  <title>Empty Abundance: Finding Meaning Through Mindful Giving - Tim McCarthy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Billboards, TV commercials, radio jingles-they all sell us the same story. &quot;You can buy happiness! The more money you make, the fuller your life will be.&quot; So we buy the shiny new sports car, the sleek designer wardrobe, the gorgeous two-story house. We work hard and make a handsome profit from our labors . . . and yet we still feel empty inside. We&#39;ve all been sold a bill of goods by the dominant consumer culture: that we can spend our way to happiness. In his new book, Tim McCarthy reveals why this simply isn&#39;t true. Like so many Americans, Tim spent years chasing the dream of material wealth, only to find that the promised rewards were empty and unsatisfying. In a voice that is instantly relatable, he recounts his personal journey of frozen assets, lost jobs, and liquidity events, speaking candidly about his own struggles with depression. Empty Abundance is the story of one man&#39;s path to true abundance-the kind that is not reliant on wealth or material gain. But the book is for anyone who has ever thought, &quot;I have everything I ever wanted. Why am I unhappy?&quot; The story will resonate deeply with anyone who, like Tim, has battled dysthymia or &quot;anhedonia&quot;-the inability to feel pleasure-and wondered how he or she could live differently. Today, Tim runs a private foundation, the Business of Good, funded by his fortune and several other successful for-profit enterprises. Drawing on a lifetime of lessons learned, Empty Abundance offers readers an avenue into deeper meaning, greater self-realization, and the enduring riches of service to others." />
