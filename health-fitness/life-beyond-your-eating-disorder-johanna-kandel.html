        &lt;p&gt;· Strengthen the healthy, positive voice&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;· Let go of all-or-nothing thinking&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;· Overcome fear and embrace change&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;· Stay motivated and keep moving forward&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Complete with inspiring true stories from others who have won their personal battles with eating disorders, this book provides the help you need to break free from your eating disorder and discover how wonderful life really can be.
