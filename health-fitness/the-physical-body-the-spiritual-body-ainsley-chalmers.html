  <title>The Physical Body, the Spiritual Body - Ainsley Chalmers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I became a Christian in my fortieth year. Not long after, it dawned on me that there was a spiritual counterpart to some of my medical research findings and to what I had been teaching medical students. This research included my findings in the areas of cancer, renal stone chemistry, clinical biochemistry, and factors affecting immunity. This correlation between the physical and spiritual was exciting and enhancing to my Christian walk and is discussed in detail in this book. I have tried to remove any scientific terms and details which may confuse the reader and have written it in a simplified, hopefully more understandable, scientific language so that even those with limited scientific knowledge may understand it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my initial Christian walk, I was a theistic evolutionist for about twenty years. That is, I believed in God but went along with the evolution story as I had been taught in university studies. However, the first few chapters on Genesis in the bible didnt make much sense through the lens of evolution. So I brought my scientific knowledge to test these chapters of Genesis. To cut a long story short, I am now a creationist. The first few chapters on Genesis now make complete sense scientifically, as is discussed in this book. In this endeavor I had the considerable help of the Creation Science Group (Creation.com), and my thanks go to them. I should emphasize that my salvation as a Christian has little to do with my creation beliefs. However, my creation beliefs are a firm foundation of my cornerstone beliefs of salvation, justification, and redemption through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the cross of Calvary for my sins, two thousand years ago.&lt;/p&gt;" />
