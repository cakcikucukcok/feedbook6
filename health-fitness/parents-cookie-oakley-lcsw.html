  <title>Parents - Cookie Oakley Lcsw</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Your children will be the most important legacy of your life, so what are you doing to give them the best possible chance to succeed? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cookie Oakley, a licensed clinical social worker, knows all too well that many parents need help answering that question, and her love and teach philosophy that relies on laws of nature can help even first-time parents master the art of raising a child poised for success. &lt;/p&gt;
In this guidebook to parenting, youll learn how to: &lt;/p&gt;
 decide what type of parent you want to be; 
 show your children how much you love them; 
 teach your child life skills in an effective and loving manner; and 
 discipline a child without inflicting harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Children who are not required to learn core age-appropriate life responsibilities learn to be lazy and expect someone else to meet their demands, which is why its more important than ever to teach them basic life skills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By being unselfish, loyal, and showing benevolent concern for the good of your children, youll be on your way to helping them become accomplished adults. &lt;/p&gt;" />
