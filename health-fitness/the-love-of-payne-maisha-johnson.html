  <title>The Love of Payne - Maisha Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A very sensitive and introverted female child, Dana Payne grows up moms favorite but suffers tremendously from emotional and spiritual neglect.  Somehow she is able to share an unconditional love without ever experiencing it or knowing the origin of the love that flowed through her.  Her mom sheltered her and her sisters a great deal.  Even from their father!  Was it protection or just control?  Developing into a capable adult and experiencing several failed attempts at love she finds the man with whom she will later experience the joy of baring his children and the painful reality of still never receiving the love of a man.  She also finds herself a victim of the infidelity that a lack of love was sure to bring.  On the brink of insanity, balled up in the corner in the back of her clothes closet she hears a calm and comforting voice that will change her life foreverThen begins her journey to finding out who she is and her purpose in life!" />
