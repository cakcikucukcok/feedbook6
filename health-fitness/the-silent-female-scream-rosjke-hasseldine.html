  <title>The Silent Female Scream: - Rosjke Hasseldine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Silent Female Scream&amp;quot; teaches &amp;quot;how to believe that as a woman you have the right to be heard, valued, and respected, and to know that anything less is just not okay.&amp;quot; Through case studies and discussion, the author exposes that women&amp;#39;s sense of self-worth and entitlement to speak their needs, especially in relationships, is an area that feminism has ignored to its peril. By looking at the legacy of emtoional silence that many women have inherited from long before our grandmother&amp;#39;s day, she warns that emotional silence damages the mother-daughter relationship, women&amp;#39;s relationships&amp;nbsp;with themselves and each other, and their equality and visibility. Using key questions, the author guides the reader to wake-up to her own learned silence and teaches a language of entitlement and visibility that has until now been missing for&amp;nbsp;women.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is emotional food. It strips away women&amp;#39;s learned silence and launches the women&amp;#39;s movement into a new way of thinking: how sexism, inequality, and invisibility impacts how women feel about themselves.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
