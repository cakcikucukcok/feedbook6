  <title>Totally Wired - Anastasia Goodstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;A must read for parents (and future parents) of teenagers. Consider Anastasia Goodstein as the daughter you totally &#39;get&#39; - explaining all the behaviors of the daughter you totally don&#39;t &#39;get.&#39; Consider this a parent/teen dictionary. Brilliant and lifesaving!&quot; &lt;br&gt;- Atoosa Rubenstein, former editor in chief of &lt;i&gt;Seventeen&lt;/i&gt; magazine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Totally Wired&lt;/i&gt; is both an awakening and a comfort for adults who feel lost in the infinite alleys of cyberspace. Goodstein gives it to us straight - honestly examining the threats to kids, but also including fresh insights into the positive ways young people use the wired world in their lives.&quot;&lt;br&gt;- Joe Kelly, president of Dads &amp; Daughters and author of &lt;i&gt;Dads and Daughters: How to Inspire, Understand, and Support Your Daughter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hooking up via MySpace, bullying on a blog. Using a cell phone as a tracking device? Clearly, being a teen today isn&#39;t the same as it used to be. So what are LiveJournal, Xanga, Facebook, and MySpace, and what exactly are teens doing on these sites?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Totally Wired&lt;/i&gt; is the first inside guide to what teens are &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; doing on the Internet and with technology today. Author Anastasia Goodstein creates an informative and accessible guide that covers topics such as social networking, blogging, cyberbullying, and much, much more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including interviews with a cross section of industry professionals and teenagers, and loaded with fascinating statistics and revealing anecdotes, &lt;i&gt;Totally Wired&lt;/i&gt; is the first guide that explains to parents in easy-to-understand terms what kids are really up to online, and arms parents with the knowledge they need to promote Internet safety.&lt;/p&gt;" />
