  <title>Diamonds or Rocks - José Ramírez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Diamonds or Rocks is about the awareness of your inner self because that is where we find the balance of our lives, and that is also where the origin of most of our problems is found. As kids we were very happy, yet it is in our childhoods that most of our problems started. Through this book you are going to learn that there are elements the author calls rocks, which are not a natural part of you, but due to your lack of awareness of them, they are harming you. They managed to get in your mind and take up residence there, and now these intruders have got to be stopped. Through the concept behind the book Diamonds or Rocks, you will gain the tools that have the power to get rid of them and stop the damage they are doing to you. 
The author says, I may be the first human being to figure this out, but when you read this book you are going to realize that it all makes sense. These intruders are crushing your mind just like viruses and malware cause a computer to crash.
Diamonds or Rocks was created to be as simple as possible so anyone can take advantage of it and understand it. The book uses analogies through which you will be able to distinguish such an intrusion of these elements, or rocks." />
