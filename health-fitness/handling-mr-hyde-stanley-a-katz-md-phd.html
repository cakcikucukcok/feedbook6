  <title>Handling Mr. Hyde - Stanley A. Katz Md PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Millions of people in the United States suffer from the devastating, stigmatizing mental illness called manic depression. Much of the care they receive from their doctors is ineffective. Much of the information they receive about their medications is misleading. Furthermore, their loved ones are not allowed information even though they are critical in assisting the patient cope with the disease. &lt;I&gt;Handling Mr. Hyde&lt;/I&gt; is intended to help patients and their loved ones understand these issues and a myriad of other ones that are associated with this disease that extend well beyond medicine to virtually every aspect of life. It is most helpful if read initially upon diagnosis, or even suspicion of the illness, by the patient, the family, or friends. Half of the chapters are written in a question and answer format that allows readers to directly find guidance regarding their most significant concerns as if the authors were discussing it with them. The other chapters are essays on topics that are treated in greater depth than the question and answer format permits. The book is unique in that it is written from three perspectives: the patient, who also has the point of view and expertise of a physician, and a member of his family. SAK is a physician who has had residency training in internal medicine, neurology and psychiatry. In addition, both authors have doctorate degrees (SAK in physiology and IMK in mechanical engineering) providing advanced scientific training. The philosophy of the answers are based on the common sense and stoicism gained by experience, backed by the scientific, economic, and social insight gained by learning.&lt;/P&gt;" />
