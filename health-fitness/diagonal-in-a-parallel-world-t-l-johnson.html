  <title>Diagonal in a Parallel World - T.L. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Diagonal In A Parallel World&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Navigating through this Journey of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder has with intensity made a profound imprint on my own self awareness. The level of honesty and transparency that was essential to accepting and overcoming my own fears, truths and ownerships was the hardest hurdles. In achieving the required inner balance through acceptance, I was given the clarity needed to see how easily a life can significantly transform simply by choice, and association. The magnitude of transformations and emotional upheavals by description were the best of times and the worst of times and literally had the power to transpire in a split second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;The truths of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder are without question one of the most perplexing set of societal dilemmas. Preventing this Brain based disability from reoccurring could in fact be just one societal based decision from a profound permanent positive change. However the lifelong adverse repercussion for those already impacted by FASD will never disappear; the quality of life or the standard to which they function can only change through implemented interventions and supports. It does not just take a community to raise a child with special needs it literally involves universal change and commitment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;The Truth is Powerful&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diagonal In A Parallel World is a reflection of truths that will hopefully be what is required to bring forth positive changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
