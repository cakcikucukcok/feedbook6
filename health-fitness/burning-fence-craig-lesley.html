  <title>Burning Fence - Craig Lesley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Burning Fence,&lt;/i&gt; acclaimed novelist Craig Lesley turns his keen eye toward two difficult fathers and an alcohol-damaged Indian foster child, Craig&#39;s own &quot;son,&quot; Wade. Abandoned by his shell-shocked father, Rudell, Craig grew up with his stepfather, Vern, a tough, controlling railroader. When events turned nasty, Craig, his mother, and his baby sister fled on the night train and arrived at an Indian reservation where his mother found work. Decades later, convinced he would be a better father than Rudell or Vern, Craig takes in the troubled Wade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But desperation over Wade&#39;s violent acts motivates Craig to seek out Rudell in remote Monument, Oregon. Craig hopes his father, a reclusive coyote trapper and poacher, will help raise his disturbed grandson. There Craig meets his colorful half-brother, Ormand, a would-be East Coast hit man, now &quot;born again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skillfully capturing the rural humor, rugged characters, and hardscrabble life of Eastern Oregon, &lt;i&gt;Burning Fence&lt;/i&gt; presents a searing reflection on fatherhood and offers remarkable insight into the landscape of the Western heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
