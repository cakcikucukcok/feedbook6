  <title>Texting to Your Teen’S Heart - Jane Dinsmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book offers help to parents looking to find ways to connect with their busy, technology-focused teens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you struck by how little time you have to build a strong relationship with your teen? Do you want to inject more joy into your relationship? Do you see areas where your teen needs guidance? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intentional texting is a term I use to describe the commitment a parent or parent surrogate makes to send a daily text to a child he or she loves with the intention of communicating something purposeful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is packed with information that will help enhance your relationship with your teen. If you and your teen already have a great relationship, then this will add a new depth of connection. If you and your teen are struggling, you may find that this will completely revolutionize your relationship. You will find tools to help you understand your teen more deeply and, with only a small investment of time, will truly revitalize your relationship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parents sacrifice daily for their children on multiple fronts. Parents invest money, time, energy, and love in their children, but often those sacrifices are not noticed or appreciated. Remarkably, the techniques described in this book require the smallest of investments and generate tremendous returns. I have one underlying goal for intentional texting: I want to communicate to my children in a way they can hear how much I love them.&lt;/p&gt;
