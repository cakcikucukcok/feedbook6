  <title>Precious Cargo - Arthur W. Hoffmann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Precious Cargo is a term safety advocates use to describe helpless children who are at
risk when riding in automobiles. These fragile passengers are dependent upon parents
and caregivers to protect them and ensure their wellbeing. Motor vehicle crashes claim
thousands of child fatalities and debilitating injuries every year. Unrestrained children are
at the greatest risk of death and serious injury. Use of Child Restraint Systems is essential
to protect your loved ones.
The author reviews the historical basis of child car seats and the evolution of child safety
restraints to date. Child restraint systems have a proven record of saving the
lives of numerous children, and reducing serious injury of thousands of
others. However, it has been a rocky road.
Current child seats are effective when used correctly but misuse;
confusion, and product recalls have tainted the industry. Progress
toward advancing child safety has stalled; with little progress over
the past 40 years. Obsolete and ineffective testing methodology
needs to be corrected to advance the state-of-art.
The Car companies are not involved in child restraint design,
crash testing or vehicle installation problems. The National
Highway Traffic safety Administration (NHTSA)
oversight has been negligent and ineffective in
advancing child safety technology.
Cooperation between car companies, child seat
manufacturers, NHTSA, and concerned safety
advocates as the way-forward to advancing
child safety is presented." />
