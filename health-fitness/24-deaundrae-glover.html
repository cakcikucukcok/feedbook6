  <title>24 - Deaundrae Glover</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DeaUndrae Glover was born and raised in Shreveport, Louisiana. At the age of six, his mother, Sharon Glover, was murdered. Her body was found on November 14, 1993, on Mount Olive Church Road. Then, his father remarried and DeaUndraes life would change forever.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With his older sister, DeaUndrae moved in with his father and his new wife and her six kids. DeaUndrae was still dealing with the loss of his mother but always had his favorite grandma, Lee Ann. She treated his sister and him like kings and queens. It would be when DeaUndrae went back home to his fathers house that he started going through neglect, depression, abuse, and bullying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DeaUndrae was always told What goes on in this house, stays in this house. Sad, depressed, and scared, he never told a soul until now. DeaUndrae was always told by his stepmother, You will never amount to anything; you wont graduate from high school. You will be just like you fathernothing but a crack head. This pushed DeaUndrae to become who he is today. He still deals with the loss of his mother, because the killer has not been caught. DeaUndrae wrote this book to show kids and parents that there is help. You should tell someone when you are in need and remember to speak up for yourself." />
