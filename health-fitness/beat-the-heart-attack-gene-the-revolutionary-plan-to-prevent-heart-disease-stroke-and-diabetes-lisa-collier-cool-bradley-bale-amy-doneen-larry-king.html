It affects 81 million Americans and is the culprit in one of every two deaths in the United States. Most people think that they are not at risk of a heart attack if they control their cholesterol and blood pressure, but they aren&#39;t aware of other major risk factors. The good news is that with the right information and strategies, heart attacks are preventable-even if heart disease runs in the family.??In Beat the Heart Attack Gene, world-renowned cardiovascular specialists Bradley Bale, MD and Amy Doneen, ARNP, present a new model for understanding and preventing heart disease. They explain the three different genetic types of cholesterol profiles and tailor treatments for each type, using their cutting-edge Bale/Doneen Method, a comprehensive, evidence-based medical treatment plan that detects cardiovascular disease (CVD) at early stages and stabilizes it with individualized medical and lifestyle therapy. Beat the Heart Attack Gene includes easy quizzes and self-tests that show how to determine cholesterol genotype as well as advice for how to apply that knowledge through and individualized lifestyle advice. For heart attack and stroke survivors, the Bale/Doneen Method also helps prevent recurrences by identifying and treating what&#39;s triggering the patient&#39;s disease-a crucial step that many cardiologists neglect.??With their proven method utilized by healthcare professionals worldwide, Bale and Doneen empower readers by alerting them to potential health threats, and then offer personalized strategies so they can live healthy, active lives without fear of heart attack or stroke. Specifically, Beat the Heart Attack Gene addresses:??*The hidden cause of most heart attacks?*Early prevention methods?*The dangerous cholesterol most doctors don&#39;t check?*Major red flags for heart attack and stroke risk, including gum disease?*The genes that increase cardiovascular risk as much as smoking?*The best and worst supplements and foods for your heart?*10 surprising ways to prevent heart attacks " />
