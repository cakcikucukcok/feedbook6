      <meta name="description" content="In Texas, the only cards Sunny Dove Ledder hopes to flop on the Red River are a heart of music and tens of clubs. Sunnys passion to perform for others has been a trait passed down from her grandmother. Ultra glam-mother Pat Bell wrote for two separate newspapers in Oklahoma, sang gospel songs, and played piano at the Assembly of God. Her passion to share joy with others inspires Sunny to live out her rock star dreams. Thats until she meets Penny.
With the help of a Lady Gaga impersonator, Sunny realizes the relationship with Penny is over. As Sunny is sinking into a river of hell, she fights for her freedom. On a day that Sunny would always remember, she escapes the ball and chain and never looks back. At the end of the day, she realizes the stars in the sky share a connected passion. Its no coincidence Sunny was born this way and on this day." />
