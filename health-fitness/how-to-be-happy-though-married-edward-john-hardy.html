  <title>How to be Happy Though Married - Edward John Hardy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An amazing book, written by the Reverend E.J. Hardy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Oscar Wilde praised it extravagantly: &amp;quot;It is a complete handbook to an earthly Paradise, and its author may be regarded as the Murray of matrimony and the Baedeker of bliss.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
This book provides something really useful and thought-provoking, as well as entertaining, for anyone contemplating or living in the state of matrimony.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We strongly recommend this book as one of the best of wedding presents. It is a complete handbook to an earthly Paradise, and its author may be regarded as the Murray of Matrimony and the Baedeker of Bliss.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Pall Mall Gazette.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The author has successfully accomplished a difficult task in writing a clever and practical book on the important subject of matrimony.... This book, which is at once entertaining and full of wise precepts, deserves to be widely read.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Morning Post.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;An entertaining volume.... The new guide to matrimonial felicity.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Standard, Leader.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A clever, readable, and entertaining book.... This delicious book.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Literary Churchman.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;This most elucidatory treatise.... As a &amp;#39;companion to the honeymoon,&amp;#39; this orange blossom, true-love-knot ornamented volume should no doubt be highly esteemed.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Whitehall Review.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The book is tastefully got up, and its contents adapt it very well for a present to a young bride.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Queen.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;One of the cleverest, best written books on the subject we have read at any time. To girls contemplating marriage, the volume should be presented as a wedding gift.... Grave and gay, but never for a moment dull or tiresome. Each page sparkles with anecdote or suggestive illustration.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Ladies&amp;#39; Treasury.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A highly ornamental yet handy, well printed, and admirably written volume.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; The Lady.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A rich store of entertaining anecdote, and full of thoughts beautiful, pious, and wise. Has a tasteful binding.&amp;quot; &amp;ndash; Bookseller.&lt;/p&gt;" />
