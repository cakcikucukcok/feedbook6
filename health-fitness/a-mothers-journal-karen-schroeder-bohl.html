  <title>A Mothers Journal - Karen Schroeder Bohl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;A MOTHERS JOURNAL&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There was never a time in my life, when I was so happy, &lt;br&gt;
Scared, excited and amazed all in one moment. The &lt;br&gt;
Day I gave life to this little human being. This wide eyed &lt;br&gt;
Wonder was a part of me forever.&lt;br&gt;
INTRO; &lt;br&gt;
I began writing to my children the day I found out I was pregnant. &lt;br&gt;
Only a mother can tell you what a special &amp; often scary time &lt;br&gt;
This is in a woman&#39;s life.  I remember needing to talk to this little human being. &lt;br&gt;
Who was already such a part of me. {even though we hadn&#39;t met yet}&lt;br&gt;
This book is a way to express yourself, as a woman, especially for a mom to be. &lt;br&gt;
So I began writing to my baby while I prepared for his/her arrival. &lt;br&gt;
To me, this was the most precious gift I could give my child at the time. &lt;br&gt;" />
