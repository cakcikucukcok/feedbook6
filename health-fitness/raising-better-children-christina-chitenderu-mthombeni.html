  <title>Raising Better Children - Christina Chitenderu Mthombeni</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wrote this piece, not because I am the perfect parent, not because I possess greater knowledge of parenting, not because I can write . . . The inspiration came from the mere knowledge that as a parent, it is not by being clever or educated or in being in the best or worst of circumstances but simply that, every parent is entrusted with this responsibility.
As we move into this journey of parenting, we sometimes stumble and many a times we dont know what to do, and the most difficult moment in a parents life is when one is faced with a situation that he or she does not know what to do, where to start, or how to face it. Its like a child is looking up to you with hope and trust, but you have no idea what to do. 
Every parent will be faced with different challenges during their course of parenthood. Some challenges pushes us to the wall that we might give up and feel that we have failed. Its very easy to feel the sense of failure when faced by challenges, but being a parent is rising above these situations and making the best out of it.
In a nutshell, this book serves as a handy guide or advisory tool to parenting on a few topics that I have had exposure through my studies, work, and the society in general. It gives summarized points, which can help and guide every parent to a better outcome in this journey. Short and precise, also friendly to parents who lead busy lifestyles. 
The content in this piece is not specific to any age group, ethnicity, religion, sex, or race. It outsurfaces the general psychological needs for parents and children. Its more of a neutral material. Of course, in some parts, there can be more emphasis on maybe teenagers, toddlers, or grown-up children." />
