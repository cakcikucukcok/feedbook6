  <title>The 200 Most Important Things Kids Need to Know About Life - David Heller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The 200 Most Important Things Kids Need To Know About Life is a collection of philosophy, wisdom and compelling maxims about all the big subjects in life. For both parents and children, the experience of reading the book is like taking a course in Life 101. Among the salient topics addressed are: love, friendship, the genders, the parent-child relationship, siblings, selfishness, honesty, integrity, compassion, achievement, morality and spirituality, education, competition, making ones way in the world, being your own person, developing your values, finding your identity, and much, much more.
These compelling excerpts reflect the breadth and diversity of subjects that the book embraces:
Thoughtfulness to others is a gift you give to yourself.
Being flexible is not only a quality of rubber bands; its useful for people too.
All of the different races and cultures of the world may be natures way of drawing and coloring.
There is no such thing as excelling at something without practice -- and lots of it.
A boy is an aspiring man in search of a roadmap for how to be one.
A girl is a woman in the making who needs some help with some finishing touches." />
