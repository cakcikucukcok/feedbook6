  <title>When Your Heart Is Cracked Wide Open - TaraLynn Majeska</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What can you do when your heart is cracked wide open, and you feel like there&#39;s no hope? The answer is to use your open heart as a guide to move through life&#39;s challenges and rediscover what you are really all about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heart-breaking traumas, dramas and struggles are often a call to look deeper within to see with a new, more expanded perspective. They call us to love all the broken parts of ourselves so that we may live a life filled with love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Your Heart is Cracked Wide Open will help you to use your heart as a guide to restore your true identity as a Being of Love so that you may align with your full potential. The ancient Wisdom contained within these pages will fill you with a sense of empowerment, as well as feelings of deep love, compassion, and appreciation for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, this book supports you on a new path. It is a path that begins with answering the call and the freedom to create anew, which leads to the wonder of fresh possibilities that you may have missed - had your heart remained closed and unconscious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;YOU are the primary factor in navigating through your life and destiny. Let yourself discover how a willingness to examine and release old, worn-out perceptions can reinvent your life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
