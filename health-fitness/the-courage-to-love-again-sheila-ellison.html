  <title>The Courage to Love Again - Sheila Ellison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For many divorced women, the prospect of reentering the dating game is a daunting one. Too often they are afraid of another failure and of not being able to get past their own feelings of inadequacy. This fear of intimacy with another man keeps many single mothers from sticking their toes back in the relationship waters. The challenges of raising children, supporting a family, managing household chores, and money concerns only make moving on with life that much harder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Sheila Ellison uses her warmth, wisdom, and personal experience to provide women with the tools they need to overcome the inner and outer obstacles to finding healthy, happy love. This book will show you how to find the courage to look at your mistakes, accept your choices, forgive yourself, and go on to a place of self-acceptance and love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part One explores the inward journey-how we learn to love and to accept who we are, and how to gain the courage to get rid of the old patterns and make room for new ideas and dreams. Part Two is about the outward journey toward a healthy new relationship. This is the exciting part, where you put your newfound self-knowledge into action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Miracles do happen!&lt;/em&gt; says Sheila Ellison. You do deserve it all, and you can have it all if you follow the steps presented here. &lt;em&gt;The Courage to Love&lt;/em&gt; Again is your blueprint to finding an enduring, loving relationship.&lt;/p&gt;" />
