  <title>6 Fun Date Ideas to Win Her Heart Volume 1 - Kym Kostos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Guys always want to impress a girl and sweep her off her feet, but sometimes have no clue as to where to start. Females by nature are great planners, especially when it comes to events, parties, and yes, even dates. Why? Because we pay attention to detail and that is what is the most important thing.     Details tell a girl how you feel about her. Simple details to intricate ones, either way they are signs of what you really feel about the girl. If you take a lot of time planning a great date, that tells the girl that you are interested in her and want to get to know her better, especially if it&#39;s a date that allows you two to talk and get to know each other better. Girls love dates like that!    Taking a girl out, tossing a burger down her throat and taking her to a movie is just plain boring. That&#39;s something you do AFTER you have won her heart and even then, it&#39;s questionable. Whatever happened to the courtship of dating?     When you take the time to plan a date to remember,it shows that you care." />
