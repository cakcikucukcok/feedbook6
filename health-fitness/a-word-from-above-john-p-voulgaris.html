  <title>A Word from Above - John P. Voulgaris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is Gods message to His people in USA and the world?
  What is Gods message to His people in USA and the world? A TIMELY WORD OF GOD: Lamp On Our Feet Light Upon Our Path provides the awareness, correction and direction we need in this
 era. We live in the most critical interim&quot; time of witnessing the fulfillment of Gods warning Signs in the last 15 years since 2001, and onward to His Crisis [Judgment] that is coming on
 about Christs Parousia His Presence in the
 air]. America can be the best flock before Him, the Bride in Beauty; at the same time, Babylon the Great runs her broad course toward the
 Beast. Why should we be wavering between two opinions and paths; from a top blessing to a worst ending? The Lord says, Then I will turn to the people whose lips being pure to call of all of them in the
 name of Yahweh to serve Him shoulder to shoulder in one
 consent (Zeph. 3:9).
 This Word is for NOW!  He is looking to turn to the people whose lips being pure to call of all of them in the name of Yahweh to serve Him shoulder to shoulder in one consent (Zeph. 3:9)." />
