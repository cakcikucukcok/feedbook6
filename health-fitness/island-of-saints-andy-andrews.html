  <title>Island of Saints - Andy Andrews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;While digging up a withering wax myrtle tree beside his waterfront home on the Gulf coast, author Andy Andrews unearths a rusted metal container filled with Nazi artifacts and begins an intriguing investigation that unlocks an unspoken past that took place in his backyard . . . literally . . .&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;. . . In the summer of 1942, as the country gears up for a full-scale commitment to WWII, German subs are dispatched to the Gulf of Mexico to sink U.S. vessels carrying goods and fuel for the war. While taking a late-night walk along the coastline, Helen Mason-recently widowed by the realities of war-discovers the near-lifeless body of a German sailor. Enraged at the site of Josef Landermann&#39;s uniform, Helen is prepared to leave the lieutenant to die when an unusual phrase, faintly uttered, changes her mind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Set in a period simmering with anger and suspicion, &lt;em&gt;Island of Saints&lt;/em&gt; offers the very real chronicle of a small town preparing itself for the worst the world has to offer.&amp;nbsp; As cargo from torpedoed ships begins to wash up on the beach, Josef and Helen must reconcile their pasts in order to create a future. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Blending his unique style of historical accuracy with unparalleled storytelling, &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;best-selling author Andy Andrews offers a tale of war, faith, and forgiveness-illuminating the one principle that frees the human spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
