      <meta name="description" content="Raising children today is a challenge for anyone. For those who were raised with alcoholism or other chemical dependency, the challenge can be overwhelming. Trapped between our parents and our children, we may fear both the old and the new.
In &lt;i&gt;Adult Children Raising Children,&lt;/i&gt; author Randy Colton Rolfe demonstrates that all our children really need is us being our true selves. Using case studies and real-life anecdotes, she helps us take a compassionate inventory of ourselves and our reactionsto our old family, our new family, and the relationship between them. She offers new strategies for everyday situations, as well as ways to find out who we really are and how to be that wonderful person for our children. Discover the best ways to
	avoid overreacting when your buttons are pushed;
	develop rules that stick;
	stop trying to please everyone;
	be loving without being a pushover;
	instill responsibility in your child;
	motivate with the carrot rather than the stick;
	relax and have fun!
