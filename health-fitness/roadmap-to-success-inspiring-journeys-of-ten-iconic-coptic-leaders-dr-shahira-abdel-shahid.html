  <title>Roadmap to Success: Inspiring Journeys of Ten Iconic Coptic Leaders - Dr. Shahira Abdel Shahid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dr. Shahira Abdel Shahid focused on Copts, or Christian Egyptians, to draw attention to their achievements and contributions to the Egyptian society, and to the world at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She conducted in-depth interviews with ten iconic Coptic leaders, including an investment banker, a fashion designer, a Coptologist, an emeritus professor of medicine, a renowned priest, and others. Women are equally represented to emphasize the important role played by women in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interviews covered various topics such as the interviewees mission, their values, their role models, the impact their Coptic faith had on their success, their definition of leadership, the challenges they have met, the lessons they have learned, their daily schedules, their future projects, and the impact they want to leave on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book will motivate any person facing difficulties or challenges, living in Egypt or in another country, to be positive, proactive, have faith, take action to change his or her circumstances, and fulfill his or her mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If youre facing any type of challenge, youll be inspired by the message of hope in &lt;em&gt;Roadmap to Success&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RECENT RECOGNITION:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Middle East Outreach Council (MEOC) is a US national non-profit organization established in 1981. It is working to increase public knowledge about peoples, places, and cultures of the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MEOC established the Annual Middle East Book Award in 1999 to recognize books for children and young adults that contribute meaningfully for the understanding of the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Books that are nominated for the awards are judged on the authenticity of their portrayal of a Middle Eastern subject, as well as, their characterization, plot and appeal for the intended audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A committee of MEOC members including teachers, librarians, outreach coordinators, and other educators select award winners and (if deemed appropriate honorable mention titles) in three categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Picture Book&lt;/p&gt;
