  <title>The Ultimate Ketogenic cookbook - Amy Ramos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you want to eat well while dieting?&lt;br /&gt;
Do you like to try simple but varied recipes?&lt;br /&gt;
If yes, this book is for you!&lt;br /&gt;
For quite some time, we place blame on dietary fat for weight gain and health issues. The truth is that a diet that is surplus in natural and healthy fats can really burn fat and transform your body! This is the hidden secret behind the ketogenic diet. As you consume more calories from nutritious fats and reduce carbohydrates, you begin to burn fat, lose weight and feel agile and energized - without starving or being deprived.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book &amp;quot;The Ultimate Ketogenic cookbook&amp;quot; deals with the &amp;quot;one size fits all&amp;quot; philosophy by offering a unique approach that is narrowed to the specific needs of an individual. I provide the tools and steps to strengthen all to develop a personalized nutrition daily plan, offering options while taking away limitations of a traditional ketogenic diet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book shows how you can improve and maintain a whole edible, food-based ketogenic diet with a priority on practical steps and tons of water-giving recipes.&lt;br /&gt;
Which Includes:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; 21-day meal plan for hight-fat,weight-loss keto challenge for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; 125 easy, healthy and delicious recipes that will burn your fat permanently.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Fantastic and uniquely easy to prepare recipes for a nutrition diet.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Steps to make your life rich in healthy fats and an insight into the nutritional values of these recipes.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; A graphic picture of each recipe&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Easy to understand format and specified duration for each recipe&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Insight on how to reach optimal ketosis without stress and lot more..." />
