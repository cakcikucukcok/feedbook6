  <title>Vortexhealing® Divine Energy Healing - Ric Weinman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;VortexHealing Divine Energy Healing is a  holistic system of energetic healing and a path  to awakening, guided by divine intelligence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without any doubt VortexHealing is the most profound &amp; significant event that I have experienced in this lifetime. Colin Snow, Tai Chi instructor. USA &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have experienced every type of healing modality I am sure, all the yogas that you can think of, I have been to see the Dali Lama in Northern India, I have sat for hours in meditation, and have tried many Chinese medicines, but nothing comes even close to the profound and powerful transformational energy that is VortexHealing. Mahala Wall, yoga teacher &amp; healer. England &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love VortexHealing. It has transformed my life beyond recognition; I am infinitely blessed to be part of this lineage. Daisy Foss, author &amp; retreat center owner. England &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In over ten years of intense exploration of a wide variety of amazing personal development tools, VortexHealing is quite simply the most profound and impactful transformational work I have ever encountered. Guy Jara, software engineer. USA &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;VortexHealing transformed my life. After trying many healing modalities, it was the first one that gave me real freedom from childhood traumas and has continued to astound me as to the depth of change it can bring about in my life. Shiraya Adani, healer. South Africa &lt;/p&gt;" />
