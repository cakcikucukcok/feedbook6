  <title>Hanging on for Dear Life - Beverly Fetzer Oakley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1982, a young couple with small children received devastating news. Jim Oakley and his wife, Beverly, were told he had a rare chest tumora malignant thymomaone known not to respond to treatment. He was given three to six months to live. Though their world had been turned upside down, the couple chose to remain hopeful. With the love and support of friends, family, and our Lord, the two were able to face seemingly insurmountable odds with great faith and courage. As you read this story, you will feel the weight of their struggle and the joy of their victory over cancer.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hanging On for Dear Life&lt;/i&gt; is a true story, one of faith, of hope, and of great love. Beverly Fetzer Oakley will take you on a journey through pain, uncertainty, and heartache, but on a road paved with joy and peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to:&lt;br&gt;
   Cope through the illness of a loved one&lt;br&gt;
   Visit terminally ill patients &lt;br&gt;
   Offer support to caregivers&lt;br&gt;
  Trust the Lord to carry you through mountains and valleys &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my forty-five years of medical practice I was never involved with a more incredible case, the amazing outcome of which was greatly influenced by Jims determination and grit, and the tremendous loving support of Beverly.&lt;br&gt;
