      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Following the success of the bestselling &lt;em&gt;Clean Gut&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wheat Belly&lt;/em&gt; comes this essential guide to improving digestive health from an expert in functional medicine&amp;#8212;who reveals why everything that ails us, from fatigue to weight gain to bloating and bad skin, can be traced back to the gut, and shares his cleansing plan to help us reclaim our health.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Vincent Pedre understands gut problems firsthand. He suffered from IBS for years before becoming an expert in functional medicine and learning how to heal his body from the inside. Dr. Pedre used his own experience to develop The Gut C.A.R.E. Program&amp;#8212;an approach that draws from both Western and Eastern methodologies, combining integrative and functional medicine&amp;#8212;that has a proven success record in his private practice in New York. Now, for the first time, Dr. Pedre makes his revolutionary plan for health and wellness available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy Gut&lt;/em&gt; takes readers step-by-step through Gut C.A.R.E.&amp;#8212;Cleanse, Activate, Restore, and Enhance&amp;#8212;which eliminates food triggers, clears the gut of unfriendly pathogens, and replaces them with healthy probiotics and nutrients that repair and heal the gut. Rather than masking symptoms with medication, he shows us how to address the problem at its core to restore the gastrointestinal system to its proper functioning state. By fixing problems in the gut, followers of Dr. Pedre&amp;#8217;s program have found that their other health woes are also cured and have lost weight, gained energy, and improved seemingly unrelated issues, such as seasonal allergies, in addition to eliminating their chronic muscle and abdominal pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete with recipes and meal plans including gluten-free, low-fat, and vegetarian options, a 28-day gut cleanse, yoga postures to help digestion, and testimonials from many of his patients, &lt;em&gt;Happy Gut &lt;/em&gt;will help you feel better and eliminate gut issues for life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
