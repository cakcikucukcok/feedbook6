  <title>Stuck on Stupid or Stuck in Stupid - Linda Porter Harrison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Stuck on Stupid or Stuck in Stupid:
(The 25 mistakes women make that prevent them from attracting and keeping true love)
Is the partner book to:
Think Like a Manand heres a thought: Start Acting Like a Man (The 25 mistakes men make that prevent them from finding and keeping true love)
I have been pondering whether or not to write a relationship book for women for quite some time. After the release of my first novelTorn Between 2 Brothas and my first relationship book Think Like A Man, I received numerous e-mails and phone calls from women asking that I write a relationship book for them. Initially, I was taken aback because I never saw myself as a relationship guru. The irony is that Ive always been the girlfriend that everyone comes to when it comes to relationships. I dont think that it is because I have had the best relationships when it comes to men. Believe me; I have had a few that I care not to remember. I must admit, I kissed a few frogs before I found my Prince Charming.  However, I do think that it is because I have always been optimistic and objective when it comes to love. Even when I have been in the midst of a tumultuous relationship, I have always been able to find my center, recognize my stupidity, and if not in that momentvery soon afterwards, get out of my circumstance. Afterwards, I brush myself off, evaluate the lesson learned and move on (something many women have trouble doing). Also, I try not to punish the next man that enters my life for the mistakes the previous guy made (huge mistake). For the last ten plus years, I have been paying close attention to the behavior of women and trying desperately to get a grip on why we continue to behave so stupidly when it comes to men. Is it that we just dont know? Or is it that we do know, but we choose to stay stuck in/on stupid? Youll have to answer these questions for yourself. Also, I interviewed men and asked them what things really bother them about women when it comes to relationships. Stuck on Stupid includes some of the most voiced concerns. After reading this book, ask your mate to read it and highlight the areas he feels you need improvement. I think youll be surprised. Dont worry, your mate wont highlight the whole book ?. Whenever youre in a relationship you have to be willing to grow and make changes. Its part of the process. Love requires it. Nevertheless, I hope that by the end of this book you will have gained some insight about your behavior and begin to make the necessary adjustments in your life to allow you to experience REAL love.
Blessings,
