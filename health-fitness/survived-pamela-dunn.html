  <title>SURVIVED - Pamela Dunn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At the age of 43, Dr Pam was a fit and healthy chiropractor dedicated to her profession and her patients. Along with her career she also juggled family commitments, a wonderful social life and lived her days to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After another busy day in the office, she was feeling a little under the weather. Thinking it was just the flu, she attempted to soldier on and put her patients first. With a brave face and a genuine smile, she got through that extra long day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Little did she know that after seeing patients that day, the tables would turn and she would be a patient in the hospital where she began her struggle to survive. The last thing she could have imagined was that her body would shut down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this true story, she shares her recollections from the experience, but more importantly the life lessons and discoveries she has made along the way. This is an inspirational, heartfelt journey into her thoughts and feelings while she was lying there for months in the Intensive Care Unit &amp;lsquo;locked in&amp;rsquo; her own body. She shares authentically what went through her mind being so close to death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr Pam was diagnosed with a rare, autoimmune disorder called Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS), which left her in a complete state of paralysis, accompanied with respiratory failure. The immune system attacked the nervous system. All she could do was &amp;lsquo;think and blink&amp;rsquo;&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Survived&amp;#39; is a survival story from not only a physical place, but a mental one. The resilience and true essence of the human spirit is shown throughout the chapters. With the selfless support of her family and friends, this story shows that the combination of inner strength, determination, patience and love can conquer the most tragic of experiences, one millimetre at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turning her tragedy into a gift, her hope is to inspire others to take a good look at what is really important in life and what matters the most. Whether it is an autoimmune condition, a tragic accident or health crisis, there are lessons and hidden blessings, as long as we have the courage not only to look, but to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
