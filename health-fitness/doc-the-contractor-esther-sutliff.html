  <title>Doc the Contractor - Esther Sutliff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Carl Alden Groff was born amid the Great Depression. Named after a doctor in New York, Carl grew into a shy little boyand his nickname, Doc. Despite living in a house without electricity or running water, Carl and his older sister, Esther, always managed to find fun, whether it was swimming in the creek, shooting fireworks, or sledding in the moonlight. Their bond was strong; their affection for each other even stronger.&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In a wonderful tribute to family and love, Esther details Carls life as he matured into manhood and eventually built a career as a contractor. A gentle man who adored his wife, Doris, and children, Carl considered himself, above all, a protector. Carl bravely faced every bump in the roadeven when his wife became ill later in life. Through her poignant narrative, Esther reveals that despite his own health obstacles, Carl helped Doris die with dignity, never revealing to his family that he too was ill. Determined to care for his loved ones until the very end, Carl unwittingly became a hero not just to his family, but also to every man, husband, and father who has made the same pledge. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doc the Contractor shares the touching story of one mans journey through life as he pledges to protect his beloved family until his last breath.&lt;/p&gt;" />
