  <title>Literary Coaching - Guidelines For Writing, Publishing And Disseminating - Miguel D&#39;Addario</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Writing is a vocation, born of a need of each person. It is an inner manifestation, a communicational expression, be it artistic, scientific or of another literary genre. It is a property of the human being, communication through writing. This means that each one will do it in their own way and form, in the same way that each reader will interpret the content of a book, magazine or other, in a different way, understanding according to their own abilities and knowledge.
San Buenaventura de Bagnoregio, wrote in the thirteenth century, that there were four ways to make a book:
1. Being a Scribe (Scriptor): Someone who writes the works of others without adding, changing or removing anything from the original text.
2. Being a Compiler (Compilator): Someone who writes works of others with additions that are not his (also others).
3. Being a Commentator (Comentator): Someone who writes the works of others and their own, giving them the
primary place to the works of others with clarifying aggregates.
4. Being an Author (Auctor): Someone who writes his own works and others, but giving the primary place to his writings and adding others to assert his own text.
Therefore, a person who writes is, in short, an Author, regardless of whether he has published his work or not. And the difference lies in the legal nature that the company manages by identifying each work, the ISBN. This number makes up the legal nature of a publication, and inserts this work in the international bibliographic bases, it is the identity document of each book.&lt;br/&gt;" />
