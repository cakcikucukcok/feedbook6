  <title>The Millennial Makeover - Hailey Jordan Yatros</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Millennial generation. Generation Y. The underdeveloped generation. The lazy kids. The tweeters. The ones always on their smart phones. The ones who feel entitled. It is no secret that millennialsyoung adults born between 1980 and 2000are stereotyped. Some think were lazy, some think we are so engrossed in technology that we dont have the drive to be successful (dont forget to tweet that), and some believe that we are the most optimistic generation around. Whether positive or negative, this book has been designed to help tear down those stereotypes and help focus on what truly matters: who we are as young adults and who we can become. It only takes one person, one soul, and one stand to change nations; and that one person is you. This book will unveil what it takes to be a leader of this generation by uncovering the innate possibilities within ourselves. My mission is to bridge the gap between the millennial generation and the generation before us by teaching instruments of communication. Are you a person who desires to step out in courage and follow your passion so that your dreams can become a reality? If your answer is yes, then its time for a millennial makeover." />
