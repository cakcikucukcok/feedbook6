  <title>The Earthworm Farmer’S Bible - Daniel C. Merrill M.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Merrill has written numerous books and
novels. In this book the author shares his
extensive experience in vermiculture and his
lifelong passion for organic gardening with
the reader.
We believe this to be the most comprehensive
book ever written on earthworm farming and
organic gardening.
Dr. Merrill tells you how to raise earthworms,
what to feed composting earthworms and
how to harvest and process the valuable worm
castings your earthworms will produce. You
dont have to invest a lot of money on worms
or expensive bins to compost your kitchen
waste and newspapers at home. You may be
surprised to learn that you can get started for
less than the cost of a couple of cups of coffee at Starbucks. In fact, you dont have
to spend a dime on earthworms Dr. Merrill tells you where to get them for free.
Yes, for free and your initial worm bins can be purchased from any hardware store
for less than $10.00!
For those who are interested in a larger commercial worm farming operation,
the author tells you how to achieve your goal, again, at far less expense than
you might expect. As Dr. Merrill says You dont have to invest thousands
of dollars on worms and expensive equipment to make a lot of money in an
earthworm farming business." />
