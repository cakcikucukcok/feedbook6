  <title>The Choice Is Ours - Larry B. Thrall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is no political solution to the dilemma we are in. It doesnt matter if it is the Republicans or the Democrats, changing to the other party will not solve our problems. We have seen that improves nothing. The only real difference between the parties, anyway, is how much to spend, where to spend it, and who to take it from. Many think we need to throw out the whole bunch. But the question is: who would we get to replace them? And would we be any better off by just changing those at the top? Politicians in a society based on greed do not do what is best for the people; they do what is best for themselves. To change the politicians, we need to change ourselvesbecause they are some of us. They are just in a position to take advantage of the greed we, as a society, live by. 
Our religions have gotten us only so far. The religion of Hell, fire, and brimstone, is no longer serving us. It is time we started being honest with ourselves about what we really believe, and how we act. The way we treat one another is the measure of our consciousness. Even with having religions, we have been as cruel as we can possibly be to each otherphysically, mentally, and emotionally, and there is no more evil that we can do. We have done it all. To improve further, we need to evolve to a new level in our spirituality---one of love and compassion. 
This book is a call for us to take our power back, to mature as a society, and to develop compassion and tolerance for one another. Having compassion is the only way we will be able to make things better for ourselves." />
