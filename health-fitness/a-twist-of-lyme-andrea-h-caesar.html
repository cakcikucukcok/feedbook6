  <title>A Twist of Lyme - Andrea H. Caesar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When she moved to Barrington, Rhode Island, Andrea Caesar was an active, happy, vivacious ten-year-old who loved to play kickball and hang from the monkey bars. A year later, Andrea had trouble catching her breath while running, was plagued by migraines, and battled constant muscle aches. Andrea had changed as a person; she was the kid who was always missing school. Although she did not know it at the time, she had contracted Borrelia burgdorferi, better known as Lyme disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caesar, who was finally diagnosed at age thirty-six, shares a raw and honest look inside the mind of a woman tormented by treatment in her pursuit of wellness. She chronicles her life from age eleven through her diagnosis and subsequent treatment, recalling her emotions as she struggled with Lyme, its symptoms, and multiple related infectionsall while attempting to live a normal life. Driven by her determination to help others with the same affliction, Caesar provides details on what worked, what did not work, and why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Twist of Lyme shares the captivating, heart-wrenching story of a womans decades-long battle with Lyme disease as she is led by perseverance, courage, and hope to an eventual diagnosis and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;" />
