  <title>Killing Yourself Successfully? - Thivhilaeli Simon Nedohe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is entitled Killing yourself successfully? It is its intention to ask whether you are not your own dream and vision killer. Are there no issues you would have addressed differently in your life, in another persons life or in your church or community, but feared untested opinions? Many people tell themselves what will people say about me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book acknowledges that there are setbacks in life and that life is full of many stressors. It however proposes that stress can be turned around to be a stepping stone towards success. For indeed, half a glass is either half full or half empty, depending on how you look at it. How you look at it depends on your circumstances. Your circumstances depend on what you are full of inside you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book will give you the courage to confront your inner side to live and let live. Killing yourself successfully? is the title given to this book purposely. Its focus is men and women, boys and girls and the aged who are going through hard times in their lives, those who are depressed, stressed and who sometimes wish the earth could break and they vanish into its womb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main assumption in this book is that there are people who are stressed. It is further assumed that the majority of those undergoing stress choose to do so, willingly or unwillingly; with full knowledge or ignorant. Given another side of life and chance with different facts they can decide to live happily. Sorrow and happiness is a personal decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some however get advice to get rid of their stressors, and yet refuse to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book aims at challenging those who are undergoing stress in their lives to decide to live happily. If they dont, they have chosen to kill themselves successfully. It is those who refuse to face their problems head on. If you are one of them, this book is for you!  &lt;/p&gt;" />
