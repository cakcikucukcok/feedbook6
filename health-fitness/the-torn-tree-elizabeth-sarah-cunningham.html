  <title>The Torn Tree - Elizabeth Sarah Cunningham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Torn Tree&lt;/i&gt; is the heart breaking story about Sheila&#39;s life, who was born during an unfortunate time in her parent&#39;s life; and ultimately, after the untimely death of her father. Her mother tried to do her best to give Sheila the up most advice to accomplish life&#39;s successes as a young girl; but, is overwhelmed by all of of her other children prior to Sheila; in which she had great difficulties in finding ways to support them.
&lt;br&gt;
Sheila&#39;s parents were extremely poor; and, those situations made life difficult for them and their children. They had become sharecroppers, so that they could have a livable place to stay; and as well, put food on their table and fill the needs of the family. After the death of her husband, Brenda is forced to find another domicile for her already nine children. Her young sons were not quite old enough to take over the farming chores; like their father, so, that was the reason why they had to move.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Torn Tree&lt;/i&gt; follow the life and struggles of Sheila, as she tries to find her way in the world; with lots of obstacles. She was not psychologically strong because of her immaturity, during the timing of her mother&#39;s death. Her painful odyssey had begun whenever she was taken against her will to Detroit Michigan, where she had to face the biggest challenges in her young life. Though this book is nonfiction; some of the names have been changed, due to the author&#39;s choice." />
