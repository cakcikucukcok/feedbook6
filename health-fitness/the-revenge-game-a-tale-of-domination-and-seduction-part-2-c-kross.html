  <title>The Revenge Game: A Tale of Domination and Seduction Part 2 - C. Kross</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thursday night came and I showed up once again at Kendra&#39;s door. She answered. This time she was wearing a full vinyl dress that zipped up in the front with matching thigh high vinyl boots. &quot;Come in.&quot; She said cold and sternly. &quot;Strip naked and put these on.&quot; She handed me a pair of vinyl shorts. &quot;Take off your shoes and socks too.&quot;    I stripped down naked as she watched me. I then put on the shorts. They were really tight so there was a slight pain and discomfort. &quot;I&#39;m finished.&quot;    &quot;Excellent. Let&#39;s go.&quot; I followed her down to the basement dungeon. &quot;Wait here and I will be back.&quot;    She had upgraded the dungeon. Probably with the 50 thousand I had given her. The floor was carpeted now, except for an area where a claw footed bathtub stood and a pedestal sink was. Above the bathtub there were chains hanging from the ceiling attached to leather straps, which were hooked to the side of the wall, I suppose so she won&#39;t smack her head on them." />
