Quotes for back of book:
&quot;Lenora has a true servants heart that always uplifts and encourages. Her boldness and desire to help others with relationships and life shines brightly through her writing.&quot;
Steve Henderlong, 39 Stripes
Through her conversational manner, and openness in sharing her personal challenges during this journey to understanding, Lenora provides a refreshing approach to absorbing and applying the important spiritual truths contained within this book

&quot;Over the years, I have watched Lenora bloom into a mighty woman of God. Her story is almost like Cinderella&#39;s; a harsh upbringing coupled with an adoring Bridegroom and a blushing bride. She is so in love with Jesus!. This book is a testimony to the power of love and what can happen when a person surrenders to our God, who IS love.&quot;
