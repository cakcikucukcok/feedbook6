We are all familiar with our own negative self-talk; &quot;If I could just change...&quot;, &quot;If this would only happen...&quot;, &quot;I&#39;ll be happy when...&quot;.  We are all looking for the proverbial fairy godmother to come and wave her magic wand.  What we don&#39;t realise is WE are OUR OWN fairy godmother!  YOU, right now, have the magic wand that can change your life! You don&#39;t need anyone else&#39;s permission to change or &#39;fix&#39; your pumpkin. You can laugh, be happy, successful, empowered and have fun again. Cinderella, you can Put the Pumpkin Down and Take Yourself to the Ball!   Inside this book you will unveil: Your personal invitation to the ball; a set of directions for your magic wand; and tools that will have you powerfully pulverising any pumpkins that are hanging round your neck and weighing you down in life.  You will discover:  • The difference between Empathy and Sympathy; and how one is a pumpkin &#39;ball and chain&#39; while the other a &#39;dance at the ball&#39;. • True simplicity and why easy is a whole different ball game. • 12 simple steps to navigate your way successfully through any situation in life with poise and confidence. • The essential tools you need to know, so that you go to the ball on your own terms. • The secret to rediscovering and unleashing your own &#39;magic wand&#39; and the power within. • How you can avoid so much pain by simply facing up to life and who you are. (aka: Head in sand = Butt free for a kicking!) • The essential happiness equation that EVERYONE needs to know to have the best time ever at the BALL." />
