  <title>Good Vibrations—A Healer’S Journey - Patrick Deprez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Like many scientists, Patrick Deprez put his work ahead of his own health. The demands of his work as an analytical chemist consumed his life, and he drifted into a vortex of anxiety and depression. One fateful Friday afternoon, his mind broke down under the stress of his immense workload. Two painful days later, he reached out for help.&lt;br /&gt;
Following his recovery, he experienced a life-changing epiphany in the middle of the night. Now an eager traveler on an unexpected path, Patricks life was renewed with purpose. He was touched by Godand nothing would ever be the same again. Good VibrationsA Healers Journey is an amazing and true account of his dramatic physical and spiritual change. &lt;br /&gt;
Patrick always felt the calling to be a doctor, to help those who suffered. As a young man, he flew between his native Belgium and Africa, where his father worked as an engineer. He knew from a young age that he wanted to earn his pilots wings one day. And he achieved both dreams.&lt;br /&gt;
In this memoir, Patrick explains how he taps into divine energy to help heal people diagnosed with serious illnesses, including cancer and heart disease. He also describes the steps involved in doing a healing, and provides examples of real, miraculous healings that have taken place in real people. On his remarkable journey as a healer, he has experienced revelations that have provided him with great clarity about humanity." />
