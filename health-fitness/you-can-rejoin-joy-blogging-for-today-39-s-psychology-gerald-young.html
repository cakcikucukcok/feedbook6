  <title>You Can Rejoin Joy: Blogging for Today&#39;s Psychology - Gerald Young</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Rejoining Joy seems like a hard task, but these blogs from &lt;i&gt;Psychology Today&lt;/i&gt; show you that it&#39;s possible and how to do it. Most of the blogs are from 2011, with some from 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sections I and II introduce the topic and help you achieve your goals. In Section III, I provide inspirational sayings. Sections IV to VI help with your relationships and how to change. Sections VII and VIII are personal perspectives meant to inspire. Sections IX and X are about applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Today&#39;s Psychology&lt;/i&gt; is a book that is positive and hopeful for you as the reader. It is based on scientific approaches. As a practitioner, in the book I try to be sensitive to your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dr. Gerald Young&lt;/b&gt; is an Associate Professor Psychology at Glendon College, York University, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. He is also a practicing psychologist dealing with rehabilitation and with counseling. &quot;There is unity in my university teaching, my research, my practice, and the self-help book series.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
