  <title>Moveme - Marcal Grahan Ed.D</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is it true that you are what you think? 
&lt;i&gt;MOVEME&lt;/i&gt; is a process that encourages you to think about how you approach life, family, friends, and work. Most people walk through life never thinking deeply about why things are happening to them, accepting whatever life throws at them. Several core qualities separate those who value short-lived happiness from those who strive for long-term success.
&lt;i&gt;MOVEME&lt;/i&gt; stands for these six ideas:
	&lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;otivation: to do things that take them out of their comfort zone to strive for excellence;
	&lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;penness: a willingness to listen to new ideas that may be beneficial to their growth, personally and professionally.
	&lt;b&gt;V&lt;/b&gt;ision: the ability to see beyond the surface of situations; to see beyond what is directly in front of them.
	&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;xposure: encourages you to think about the kinds of experiences you have been exposed to in your life, 
	&lt;b&gt;M&lt;/b&gt;astery: dedication to excellence in everything that you do in life.
	&lt;b&gt;E&lt;/b&gt;ngagement: interaction with groups, organizations, and the community to get things accomplished.
The workbook format of this book is essential to identify and dismantle the mindsets and attitudes that we harbor as result of learned and accepted behaviors. The questions posed are meant to encourage deep thinking and to develop ownership in this process of self-exploration." />
