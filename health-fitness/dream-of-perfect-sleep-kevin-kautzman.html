      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Dream of Perfect Sleep is the story of an aging couple, Mary and Gene, and their adult children - recovering-addict Robert and new-ager Melissa. Mary suffers from severe vertigo and just wants to watch her TV show. Gene&#39;s busy organizing a very special holiday dinner, but party planning isn&#39;t exactly his strong suit. When the estranged kids come home for the holidays, Gene reveals some unexpected news that threatens to destroy the family&#39;s already strained bonds...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;A funny, heartwarming and powerful story of hope and loss in the face of dementia and terminal illness as an elderly couple plan their last days on Earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;Winner of both the Kernodle New Play and Southwestern Playwriting Awards, Dream of Perfect Sleep receives its world premiere at the Finborough Theatre. It was originally conceived at the University of Texas at Austin with the support of a fellowship from the Michener Center for Writers.
