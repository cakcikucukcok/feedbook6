  <title>Giving up the Ghost - Karen Schultz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="LOVE NEVER DIES!  OUR LOST LOVED ONES ARE STILL WITH US IN SPIRIT!
Where do our loved ones go after death? What happens to them? This book explores the connection between the spiritual world (Heaven) and the physical world (Earth). This book is written by a Licensed Clinical Social Worker, Medium and Author, who has had experiences as a grief counselor that are mystical and spiritual in nature. There is another life for us on the other side. People continue to get signs from their lost loved ones in heaven in a variety of ways. Find out about the mystery of death, taken from real people with true stories. This book opens up a dialog about grief and the truth about life after death communication. We can help you demystify death, offer comfort and reduce the fear of the unknown. People can learn to let go of their suffering and restore their lives. 
Science tells us that energy never dies, it only changes form. This is true as those we love transition out of their physical form and back into a true vibrant state. In spirit we are productive, active, and whole. They have the ability to be the biggest supporters and cheerleaders for those left in the physical world. Time doesnt stand still and we do not become frozen in thought or opinion. We continue to grow and thrive! Regularly in communication sessions, Spirits want to relay that they are well, and more importantly, still the person they have always been. This book hits all the right notes. A must read.
