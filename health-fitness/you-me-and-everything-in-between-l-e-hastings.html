  <title>You, Me, and Everything in Between - L.E. Hastings</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Through the whole of his recovery, L.E. Hastings continues in
writing down his thoughts as a way to help himself and to pass on
a message of hope, healing, and living to others. Here in his new
book, You, Me, and Everything In Between we find ourselves once
again identifying in how we live, love, and accept. From, Dance to
the Rhythm of Life, to The Man with the G.P.S., to the heart
felt story of, Seeing Eagle. We are on board a new journey of
understanding one another in life. Here again we glimpse into the
mind and life of the writer Mr. Hastings where the pen hits the
paper and the stories of healing begin. Where we all might just
find that story within ourselves of strengths and courage in all of
our own In Betweens
A native of New England, L.E. Hastings continues to work with a
wide range of individuals with disabilities and in volunteering. He has
started working on new projects within his writing. He and his partner
are currently taking care of their cat. In his spare time he enjoys,
collecting antiques, comics, bits and pieces, stuff and things, books,
then selling them at flea markets, swap spaces, and yard sales. Also
enjoys hiking and gardening, along with his sobriety - where he is
always on the look out for Zombies" />
