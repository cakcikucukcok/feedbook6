  <title>The Authentic You - Josie Slaton Terry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In life there are always new levels for us to reach, and it takes a lifetime to become a complete person. I believe the world is a school of ever learning, and we are its students with the unbelievable potential, to be more than we can dare ask or think. This book will speaks to the real person you want and should be. The person you were born to be. The Authentic You!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am fascinated by the life and accomplishments of people who fought against the odds, the dreamers who wouldnt stop dreaming, until their dreams became a reality. In doing it, they changed the world around them. They did it and you can too. In sharing the stories of the known and the unknown, who have done such amazing deeds with their life, I believe that you will share with me, the motivation to be THE AUTHENTIC YOU&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved Fabulous Over Forty. Thank you for keeping us inspired with The Authentic You.&lt;br /&gt; -Susan H.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;You are so positive. Thank you for sharing your wisdom with us. &lt;br /&gt;-Ms. Daniel&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Authentic You is another winner. &lt;br /&gt;-Tiney Gibbs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Job well done. Keep up the good work.&lt;br /&gt;- Kathy and Donald&lt;/p&gt;" />
