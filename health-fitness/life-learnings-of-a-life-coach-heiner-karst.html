  <title>Life Learnings of a Life Coach - Heiner Karst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Elite sports people and business executives have coaches to help them perform at the highest level. The majority of coaches have themselves been leading athletes or top business people. The guidance and wisdom they impart fast-tracks the careers of those they work with. If coaching works in sport and in business - why not in everyday life? Author, Heiner Karst has spent many years coaching and mentoring clients to become the best they can be. He believes that with the right insights, many of us can coach ourselves through the obstacles we encounter, and develop a bunch of really strong, success-generating habits. The tools and approaches mapped out in this book can fast-track readers to desirable outcomes. We all face obstacles along our path, many of which are self-made. Life Learnings of a Life Coach will help us recognise them and the unconscious patterns we play out in our daily lives. With the structured guidance contained in this fascinating new book we can set about removing these obstacles and replacing them so that we can begin to live the life we have always wanted. The concepts outlined in Life Learnings of a Life Coach are a combination of universal truths, a lifetime of study and personal development, reading and learning. The book comprises 52 short chapters and is divided into five parts: 1. Let&#39;s start with you 2. Stretching your goals 3. What makes us happy? 4. There but for me, go I 5. Raising your game.
