  <title>The Answer Within - Mary Rose de Angelo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Happiness is a choice but it does not come to us by copying others. Although we may learn much from each other, we each have a personal purpose which is the most special, and the most important thing we can do. By it we define and fulfill our purpose for our Life here in Time.
      When we copy others we are feebly attempting to live their life instead of our own and sometimes miss the mark of our own Becoming.
     The Purpose of our lives can only be discovered by going within our soul and Spirit where we are led to our Beginning and our Connection to All.
      The scars of our fall which led us to living our existence here in time have left us a legacy where we will do everything and anything we can to focus outside ourselves to avoid looking Within. Because we feel an all consuming guilt we neglect the very thing that will wash away all the guilt, help us discover our personal purpose and bring complete Happiness, Health and Joy. 
      In my first book, Coming To Be, I try to show how it is necessary for us to erase the scars of our suppressions to become as healthy as we can be on the physical, emotional level. These scars are the things we were told about ourselves that led to restrictions of our growth because they put many guilt locks on our soul. That made us more afraid to go Within. So our focus is continually drawn away from discovering our true self.
      No matter how many churches or temples or mosques we build
 in an attempt to Know God, we continually focus on buildings and rites and the faults and errors of others in an attempt to avoid the very thing that will bring us complete, Peace, Joy and Love.
     In all cultures the prophets that have come to us within the various religions while seeking to lead us to the Truth have told us we must do so. The Middle Eastern Mystics spoke of becoming empty, the Christian directed us somewhat the same way.  That is through Jesus and our connection to Him. We must go Within to find Him.
     His connection to us {DNA} as man also bought God to Us in His flesh but His Godhead is Spirit so we must go within to find Him.
       However, whenever we were taught a Word by the Prophets we constantly would add to their Word of Truth. By adding to the Truth we actually take away from its Essence and change it. Truth Lives in the Center of Contradiction. That is; the very Spirit of God Who lives in the Center of Truth, no matter the name we choose to call Him, It is One and the Same.
Our guilt forever, takes us away from the Truth by our focus outside ourselves whether it is other religions, people, buildings or ceremonies, things, wealth or power.  Yet the answer to All is to go Within. There we discover the Spirit of God waiting to show us who we are." />
