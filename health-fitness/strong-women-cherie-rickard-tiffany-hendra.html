      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Adversity and tragedy can hit you in the face like a freight train whether it be, loss of loved one, marital difficulties, divorce, illness, fear, hopelessness, poverty, worries or loss of self. Without confidence, healing, self-esteem or the desire to overcome you remain stuck in a lack of motivation, fear and self-doubt, even as you long for change. You can never allow pain and adversity to stop you from your best life. I know how pain can cut deep into your soul, for 7 years I used a pen and paper and later my laptop to write down every pain, struggle and milestone I encountered after the worst day of my life. Facing a cross road in life with depression and destruction versus using my pain to regaining power I chose to live in a way that would honor my son&amp;#39;s memory and give glory to God. Many suffer in silence through trials and tribulations of life, but you don&amp;rsquo;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will surround yourself with the right crowd, learn your color wheel personality, traits of genuine friendships, communication skills and tactics to deal with impossible people, how to heal from life&amp;rsquo;s most tragic blows from grief, divorce and more. Learn the tools needed to grow in confidence defeating the battle of feeling inferior or delusions of despair. Strong Women will be your guide in leveraging your challenges into the critical life skills necessary to not just survive but thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn secrets to success and be inspired by featured Ladies like Real Housewives of Dallas Tiffany Hendra; CEO of Alexo Athletica and TV Host Amy Robbins; International Designer Abi Ferrin; Owners of award winning Virgo Boutique Julie St. Pierre &amp;amp; Bree Armand; Intuitive Spiritual Leader &amp;amp; Author Sharlotte Brian; Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, Owner of EDEN by Eden Sassoon Beauty &amp;amp; Pilates salons Eden Sassoon; Talented Make-Up Artist Kasey Acuff; Gold AdvoCare Advocate &amp;amp; California Lifestyle Blogger CJ Zucker and Media Contributor &amp;amp; Host of Life Bonds Podcast Dr. Melanie Mills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the worst day of my life I would have never imagined I would become an International Published Author, Speaker, Grief and Empowerment Coach writing and delivering messages on Building Confidence, overcoming tragedy, grief recovery, making your mess your message and learning to live a life with passion and purpose. It is a message I learned from my own life and one that I use to help others apply to their own lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
