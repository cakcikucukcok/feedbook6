      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;She wasnt a dog anyone wanted. Bald from the nape&lt;br /&gt;of her neck to the tip of her tail, she was a scrawny&lt;br /&gt;little black dog with little to recommend herself to&lt;br /&gt;anyone other than the little tricks she used to perform to&lt;br /&gt;amuse people. A loser dog.&lt;br /&gt;But then, I wasnt a person anyone wanted either. A loser&lt;br /&gt;in the eyes of the world. A neer do well named Jamie&lt;br /&gt;Fairchild, who, at the age of forty-one, had tried his luck&lt;br /&gt;in many places and invariably had failed. For twenty&lt;br /&gt;years, I had become a stranger even to the members of&lt;br /&gt;my own immediate family.&lt;br /&gt;I didnt want a dog. I wasnt even looking for one. But&lt;br /&gt;God has a way of intervening, regardless of our hopes,&lt;br /&gt;dreams, and personal wills, not necessarily giving one&lt;br /&gt;what one wants but what one needs.&lt;br /&gt;Th ey tole me you needed me, Betsy told me.&lt;br /&gt;Who told you?&lt;br /&gt;My superior offi cers, she smiled, elevating her chin&lt;br /&gt;toward heaven. Th ings hasnt been goin so well with&lt;br /&gt;ya these past twenty years. I hear tell ya had big dreams&lt;br /&gt;once, but you went bust, was homeless jes like me fer&lt;br /&gt;awhiles. I also hear tell them folks of yourn aint much&lt;br /&gt;of a family. But then, mine twerent neither. I hears ya&lt;br /&gt;likes adventure, aint afeerd of takin risks. I aint either. I&lt;br /&gt;also hear tell ya likes to perform. I does too. But ya lost&lt;br /&gt;your confi dence along the way. Well, Im here to give it&lt;br /&gt;back to ya.&lt;br /&gt;Before long, Betsy was putting me through my paces.&lt;br /&gt;Ah-ten-tion! shed bark at me. Th ats what our&lt;br /&gt;C.O. always barked at the fellas I worked with in New&lt;br /&gt;Guinea. Saunders was his name. Man, he was a doll,&lt;br /&gt;but he could also be one mean sonofabitch, let me tell&lt;br /&gt;ya. When Saunders barked them orders, them guys all&lt;br /&gt;shot up straight as ramrods. Shoulders up, ass in, chest&lt;br /&gt;out. Now, lissen up, Pop. Ah-ten-tion! Git that chin up!&lt;br /&gt;What goods it doin hangin down thataways on your&lt;br /&gt;collarbone?&lt;br /&gt;Well, no one would be able to cuff me under it if its&lt;br /&gt;hanging down.&lt;br /&gt;Lissen, Pop, she would say. No ones gonna cuff you&lt;br /&gt;under the chin. And if they does, Ill take care of em so&lt;br /&gt;good, they wont need to wear no shoes! No one messes&lt;br /&gt;with a Marine. Not if they know whats good for em.&lt;br /&gt;Now lissen up! Chin up! Shoulders back! Ass in!&lt;br /&gt;Awkward as these unaccustomed positions felt to me, I&lt;br /&gt;complied with her commands.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, her muzzle widened into a grin. Th ats more like&lt;br /&gt;it, Daddy.&lt;br /&gt;If Betsy had set me onto the road of physical exercise,&lt;br /&gt;she also corrected my posture. If it hadnt been for the&lt;br /&gt;disciplines that she imposed upon me, Id now be a&lt;br /&gt;walking question mark.&lt;br /&gt;Why are ya walkin with your shoulders down on&lt;br /&gt;your chest? shed bark. You wanna be a hunchback&lt;br /&gt;one day?&lt;br /&gt;No, I said.&lt;br /&gt;Th en stand straight and stop hangin your head, she&lt;br /&gt;said. How are ya ever goin to see where youre a-goin&lt;br /&gt;lookin down at the ground all the time?&lt;br /&gt;You look at the ground when you sniff , Id say.&lt;br /&gt;Yeah, but thats only to get the smell of direction. Its in&lt;br /&gt;the dog world what you call a map in the human one. But&lt;br /&gt;ya caint go nowheres by always lookin at the map. Time&lt;br /&gt;comes when youve gotta keep your eye on the road.&lt;br /&gt;Th is was the army now, and I had become Private Jamie&lt;br /&gt;to Sergeant Betsy. When I would slump down into that&lt;br /&gt;easy chair, one of whose armrests she had completely&lt;br /&gt;disemboweled, and had sunk into those pointless&lt;br /&gt;ruminations about what I should or should not have&lt;br /&gt;done so many years before, Betsy would approach my&lt;br /&gt;feet and deposit at them the tug o war rope, fall back&lt;br /&gt;on her rear haunches, her big brown eyes shining with&lt;br /&gt;excited anticipation, her muzzle dropped open in an&lt;br /&gt;eager smile.&lt;br /&gt;Come on, Dad, lets play.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, please, not now, Betsy, Id say.&lt;br /&gt;Oh yes, now, she insisted. Come on. What goods&lt;br /&gt;settin there goin over things you caint do nuthin bout?&lt;br /&gt;When you does stuff like this, youre like me when a fl ea&lt;br /&gt;gets on my tail and I keep tryin to bite it off of it, but&lt;br /&gt;the more I turns around, that tail jes keep gittin further&lt;br /&gt;away from me. Memories is like fl eas, Dad. You chew&lt;br /&gt;on em too long, they gets your tail sore. Ya gotta keep&lt;br /&gt;your eye on your star. Th eres one up yonder thats yourn&lt;br /&gt;and yourn alone. Keep your eye on it, and it wont be&lt;br /&gt;forgettin ya. You jes take a hold on my tail, Pop, and Ill&lt;br /&gt;take ya to your highest dreams.&lt;/p&gt;" />
