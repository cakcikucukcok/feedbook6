Fate interfered, ambushed her with life threatening events and monumental problems. Events transformed her from a shy, timid, low self-esteem young woman into a wise, knowledgeable risk taker who believes in herself.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;In this book, Alla P. Gakuba expertly outlines the importance of understanding who are you, where to channel your energy, our mind is a tape recorder, how to believe in yourself, what is life, what is quality of life, and what is happiness.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Life is unpredictable. How someone&amp;rsquo;s life develops seems beyond someone&amp;rsquo;s control, as multiple factors influence and direct life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Not happiness&amp;hellip;Happiness seems to be predictable and can even be designed. One can observe how a child bursts into a happy smile many times a day, or adults jumping into the air upon hearing some joyous news. A man is sitting on a bench in a park soaking in the warm sun, relaxing, and happy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Yes, it is happiness. But it is a flick of happiness, or glimmer that lasts moments. It comes and then disappears. So, what is true happiness that lasts months, or even years? How can one design this kind of lasting happiness?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;After reading this book, you will become sophisticated and knowledgeable, will find the answer on how to live a purposeful life, and start on your journey to design and pursue your true lasting happiness that will change your life.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Books by Alla P.
