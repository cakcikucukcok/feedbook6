  <title>The Miracle About Miracles - Schoeman Rudman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="That what seems to be the solid truth is in fact a hologram of vibrating energy tricking our senses and therefore our minds into believing the illusion.   That whatever meaning we attach to anything creates our truth. That what we believe to be good is in fact not always good, and our definition of bad is in fact sometimes our biggest growth opportunity.   However, getting trapped into spirals is often our biggest challenge when we create unconsciously. The power of faith is such that once and as long as we believe anything, it is true.  This book is about my personal journey through the jungle of mysteries, my personal roller-coaster ride through life and my discovery that as humans we are all destined to be exactly what we believe we are." />
