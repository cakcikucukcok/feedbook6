  <title>The Restaurant Diet - Fred Bollaci, Dick Smothers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Restaurant Diet Plan&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The ultimate guide for people who want to dine out guilt-free!&lt;/b&gt; &lt;i&gt;The Restaurant Diet,&lt;/i&gt; offers a diet plan that takes the pressure off of dieters who love to eat out. In &lt;i&gt;The Restaurant Diet&lt;/i&gt;, author Fred Bollaci, who lost 150 pounds (from 330):&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Teaches readers how to read a menu
&lt;li&gt;Explains how to ask important questions of the restaurant staff
&lt;li&gt;Gives guidance on how to have food customized to your dietary needs
&lt;li&gt;Provides insights into converting this into healthy eating at home.&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Eat out to your heart&#39;s content and not be overweight:&lt;/b&gt; As Fred teaches readers how to eat out and lose weight, he reveals the real secret: It’s not about preparing “clean” food at home, or going “whole” and excluding wheat, sugar, and dairy. Nor is it about counting calories or grams. It’s about WHY one overeats in the first place. Fred reveals his story of growing up in an Italian family, and how his parents’ divorce led to his eating compulsions. He tried every fad diet, but Fred was searching for a lasting solution. With the help of his doctor, a nutritionist, a trainer, and a psychologist, he was able to devise a four-phase diet and exercise plan. Fred proves that if he can do it, anyone can. He has kept the weight off for six years, running four marathons — he looks great, feels great, and can enjoy great food and drink wherever he is.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Guilt-free restaurant dining:&lt;/b&gt; Featuring recipes from America’s most noted restaurant chefs, as well as original recipes from Fred’s own kitchen, &lt;i&gt;The Restaurant Diet&lt;/i&gt; is for the 19 million Americans who love to eat out on a regular basis — and the 38% who are overweight." />
