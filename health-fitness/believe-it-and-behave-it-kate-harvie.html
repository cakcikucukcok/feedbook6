  <title>Believe It and Behave It - Kate Harvie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you angry at yourself when you miss, forget, or confuse something?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you struggle with things that once came easily to you? (Talk about an epic fail.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s time for all of that to be finished. Done. Sayonara.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shifting how you feel about, deal with, and learn from what happens in your life makes all the difference in the world. When something unexpected occurs and forces you to make radical changes, you have the opportunity to rebuild better than you ever expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kate Harvie survived a traumatic brain injury. And &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; things became difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that ain&amp;rsquo;t the half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During her &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; recovery and everything that followed (what she calls her &amp;ldquo;unofficial&amp;rdquo; recovery), Kate messed up a whole lot of things right, left, and center. Through it all, she learned to believe in her worth then, now, and forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this book, Kate shares her story with refreshing bluntness. You will learn the tools and tactics necessary to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recover from something (anything!) in ways that are aligned with who you are&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acclimate to life after being off the grid&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flip failures into unexpected opportunities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make peace with who you once were and who you are now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Face, tackle, and conquer everything that dares to question your presence and your significance&lt;/p&gt;" />
