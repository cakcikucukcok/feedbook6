  <title>The Great Bank Heist Mystery - Allan L. Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a story inspired by personal experience with a bank.
After being made redundant, the bank refused to make payments covered by personal protection insurance. Hounded for payments, they added charges and interest, causing the debts to spiral. Under extra pressure, the main cause of the eventual total breakdown of my marriage. 
Unable to continue loan and mortgage payments, was forced to sell my house well below market price. With no money and no government support, I found myself living on the streets. With no money for food, I dropped from over fifteen stone to less than eleven stone in four months. 
Twelve years later, I find that the banks had deliberately conned people out of their money, with no intention of making payments on the payment protection plans. Because of their greed, now aged seventy, I live alone in a very small rented flat; I paid off my loans but lost my family and my house. 
As a disabled diabetic, lack of proper food resulted in stomach complications, including a laparotomy and years learning to eat properly again, the poor food also resulting in me losing my eyesight.
The power of the banks meant they did not lose. The banks got their money, they also earned a fortune on the money paid to them for protection; twelve years later, they eventually paid a refund and interest at the lowest rate possible. The ordinary man in the street? They stamp on him.
This is the imaginary story of someone facing the same situation but younger, stronger, fitter, and more capable of effecting his revenge on the bank directors that robbed him." />
