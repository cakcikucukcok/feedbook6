  <title>Trying to Stop Someone from Abusing Drugs • Alcohol - Anastasia Wynne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My heart had replayed his death a thousand times. It is the phone call I have dreaded, as the voice on the other end of the line informs me he has been found dead from an overdose. This cant be. No, this just cant be happening. Why couldnt I save him? How am I going to live without him? Please God, no, this cant be. Please, please, please dont do this! The thought of him taking his last breath, alone and scared, is too much for me to bear.&lt;br /&gt;
 I had mastered every painful moment, somehow thinking&lt;br /&gt;
if I rehearsed it enough, the actuality of it wouldnt be as painful when it occurred. Every day, I prepared myself for what I believed was his inevitable death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Her soul mate RJ has been hiding a dark secret.&lt;br /&gt;
Hes addicted to crack cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once his deception is revealed, Anastasia heartbroken and&lt;br /&gt;
betrayed, is still determined to fulfill a promise made on a hot July night, that her love for him would always be unbreakable. In her desperate attempt to save him, her own life gradually begins to mirror his world of deceit, irresponsibility and obsession. As both their worlds spin helplessly out of control while she threatens, rationalizes, begs and lectures him to get help, she ultimately&lt;br /&gt;
realizes the one thing that could eventually save them both.&lt;/p&gt;" />
