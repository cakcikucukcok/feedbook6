  <title>Magical May - Flavia Waas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The idea for this book came to me after a busy few months in 2016 after which I felt the need for some me-time. I announced to a group of friends that I will dedicate the whole month of May to giving myself that much needed time to myself and work on manifesting my dreams.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Each day for 31 days I focused on something that I wanted to bring into my life. Each day I made sure to think only positive, empowering thoughts and cultivate an attitude of anything is possible. I uncovered negative, restricting beliefs and replaced them with positive beliefs of abundance, joy and love. And I shared my daily exercises with anyone who was interested on my blog and my Facebook page. And this is how Magical May was born.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If youre ready to let go of the old and invite new, exciting, joyful experiences, people, things and circumstances into your life, this book is for you. Start it anytime, it doesnt matter whether its May or June or December. Magical May applies to any month of the year. I hope youll enjoy reading this book as much as I did writing it.&lt;/P&gt;" />
