  <title>Movement of Stillness - Jacqui Derbecker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book &quot;Movement Of Stillness&quot; reveals the New Mayan Calandar post 2012 as channeled by Jacqui Derbecker from Edgar Cayce. Cayce was a well-known mystic philosopher, seer, channelor, and author. He lived from 1877-1945.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jacqui felt honoured and priviledged to channel/streamline, through automatic writing, about 100 prophecies which are revealed in complete detail. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
By channeling Cayce she was able to clearly visualize the authentic and exciting New Mayan Calandar which she states, &quot;it&#39;s not exactly what some perceive it to be.&quot; Jacqui explains, &quot;there are only positive high vibrational messages represented by the Mayan&#39;s predictions and not ones of mass destruction.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She advises that now is the time to make &quot;living in Spirit&quot; a reality as we move into a higher realm of truth and a natural original way of being.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These prophecies are called the &quot;All Truths&quot; or &quot;Crystal Messages of Truth&quot;. Each touch upon the daily living aspects of: career, relationships, financial, emotional, physical, mind, spirit and our sense of community. They speak directly to each and everyone of us regarding the releasing of old barriers and awakening to your authentic self. Thus creating a sense of stillness and peace." />
