  <title>Words to Live By - Dean Gualco</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;Failure is often the consequence of daring to touch the stars, but on those few&lt;/br&gt; 
occasions when the stars are touched the world brightens from their luster.&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book comprises the philosophies, quotes, lists, and stories that have influenced my life. Whether the journeys traveled to the highest mountains or to the lowest valleys, these philosophies have inspired me to never give in and never give up on that which is my destiny. These lists have served as the strategies and playbooks to guide my actions at home and at work. Finally, these stories have reminded me that no matter the victory or loss, greatness is within my grasp if I work hard and do the right thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My profound hope is that the philosophies and stories that have influenced my life will inspire you to create the philosophies and stories that will influence your own. Live your own life, not mine, but create the philosophies and lists that will serve as the roadmap for your journey, and the inspiration for when the light flickers along that path. Time is fleeting and boulders impede nearly every road you travel, but for those that can conquer their insecurities, overcome their burdens, do what is right, and live a decent and honorable life, the possibilities are limitless. You may not write the great American novel or shape the history that will define your generation, but you will surely live a life of excitement and adventure, and along the way  in some small way  make a difference in the world in which you lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this book inspires just one person to journey along that path, I am eternally grateful.&lt;/p&gt;" />
