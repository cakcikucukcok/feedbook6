  <title>When the Trust is Broken: Just When You Think Your Children are Safe, Think Again - Sharon Grace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story--a grandmother&#39;s story--of the experiences and events that have shaped her life, including the sexual abuse of her four-year-old granddaughter in a daycare center. In these pages, the author will share her trials and tribulations and provide insight into overcoming life&#39;s adversities, as well as what to do when the unthinkable comes out of nowhere. It is a personal, powerful, and agonizing story including a devastating fire, a flood, serious car accident, two failed marriages, a horrific family death, and the despicable acts of sexual abuse on her granddaughter, and the emotional impact it had on her family as well as the strength and forgiveness it took to overcome these challenges. Child sexual abuse is a violation of trust that can happen anywhere, anytime. Sex offenders do not pick and choose. Every child id a potential victim. &quot;When the Trust is Broken&quot; will not only educate the public but assist in recognizing some of the warning signs. Included are many success stories and many resources available to share. Everyone should have the tools and the power to protect their family. &quot;When the Trust is Broken&quot;  will take you through the day of sentencing and the prosecution of the perpetrator. &quot;Children need to know it was never their fault but the fault of the sex offender&quot;. The convicted sex offender in this case is now serving 21 years." />
