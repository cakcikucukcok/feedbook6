  <title>Born Anxious - Daniel P. Keating</title>

The debate has always been divided between nature and nurture, but as psychology professor Daniel P.

In each case, because of an exposure to environmental adversity in utero or during the first year of life, a key stress system has been welded into the &quot;on&quot; position by the methylation process, predisposing the child&#39;s body to excessive levels of the stress hormone cortisol.
