  <title>Life Lessons from My Five-Year-Old - Kimber Lynne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life Lessons from My Five-Year-Old&lt;/em&gt; shares the journey &lt;strong&gt;Kimber Lynne&lt;/strong&gt; took to remember what matters most in life. Her aha moment came when she realized that her young daughter could save her from herself and show her what really matters in life. Once she realized this, she began to enjoy the extraordinary moments that happen every day instead of trying to anticipate what the future might bring. It is through teaching her daughterand being taught by her in returnthat she has been able to change her view of lifes important moments, value, and fears and learn to live more in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her journey also included recognizing and overcoming some of the negative and destructive behaviors that have formed her own beliefs and making the necessary changes in her life so she would not pass negative traits on to her daughter. The first lesson she learned from her five-year-old was that all of the risks and emotional hurdles can help move you from the off-ramp back onto the main road moving forward. Her journey of becoming a parent to her little girl definitely moved her in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life Lessons from My Five-Year-Old&lt;/em&gt; is about recognizing the fact that we need to trust ourselves and our instincts because we probably already know the answers. Doing the work to get to know our inner self a little better can certainly help kick-start uncovering our truth and passion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
