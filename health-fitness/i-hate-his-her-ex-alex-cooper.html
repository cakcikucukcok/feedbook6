  <title>I Hate His/Her Ex - Alex Cooper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Although a qualifi ed teacher of Yoga, Meditation and Reiki,
Alex found that it does not guarantee that the mind is
always perfectly in balance, rational or justifi ed. After coming
across alien feelings within her relationship, that had nothing
to do with the love between her and her partner but more to do
with her partners past relationship, she struggled immensely
with how to deal with the anger and jealous behavior that
these feelings brought on. Being aware that it was quite a taboo
subject and that not many people like to admit to others that
they are fi nding diffi culty in coping with aspects from the past,
Alex was wary to approach the subject with friends or anyone
else for fear that they would not understand or respond well.
After much research and soul searching Alex discovered that
problems with previous exs of your partner was far more
common than she initially realised and she sought to discover
ways to come to terms with the issues so she could resolve
inner anxieties and concentrate on the most important thing,
the present. Alex has put together an understanding of why
these feelings can rise to the surface and the trauma they can
cause within a relationship. Within the book there area coping
strategies which will help you to work through these problems,
ways to communicate better and recognising irrational thoughts
and fears from those that are genuine so that we can let go of the
anxieties which can cause anger, frustration and pain within a
relationship." />
