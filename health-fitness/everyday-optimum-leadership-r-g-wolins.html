  <title>Everyday Optimum Leadership - R. G. Wolins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Servant leadershipboth its biblical and contemporary componentshow does it relate to patterns and practices in your life, the marketplace, or in a church? The purpose of this work is to answer these questions and lay out a practical pathway combined with working tools for the reader to use as they journey into their future building upon a servant leadership foundation. Future intentions are determined by present action. This working definition is a guideline: Practicing servant leadership in my life, the marketplace or in a church is self-giving service with others after the pattern of Christ in order to achieve extraordinary commitment and contributions toward mutually shared goals. Brothers, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus. Phil. 3:1314 (NKJV)&lt;/p&gt;" />
