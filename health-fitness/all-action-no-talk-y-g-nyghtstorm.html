  <title>All Action, No Talk! - Y.G. Nyghtstorm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is an old saying which goes, GOD will never give you more than you can handle.  In most cases this is true. Life does have a way of teaching us lessons that build character and wisdom is gained. There are times however, when life becomes a bully and strong arms us into submission. Do you feel as though your problems are insurmountable and there is no positive way to change your life? Maybe you have made some bad decisions. You are not alone; most people share these feelings at some point in their lives. I have been there myself countless times. 
The one thing that has kept me going is my belief that as long as Im alive, I still have a chance.  Ive learned over the years that most situations are fixable. You just have to find a positive approach that will bring about the outcome you desire. Whether your challenges involve your career, parenting, relationships or your mental well-being I can relate to your situation. As you read the pages of this book you will learn about the mistakes I have made and the lessons I have learned. I have been through hell and I have made it out of the other side.  Let me show you how I did it because rather you believe it or not, you can too." />
