  <title>Noli Me Tangere - Tagalog and English Editions Anthology - Jose Rizal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Noli Me Tangere: Tagalog and English Editions Anthology&lt;/i&gt; contains both of the classic Tagalog and English translations of this historical Filipino novel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Written by Jos&amp;eacute; Rizal, who is recognized as a national hero of the Philippines, &lt;i&gt;Noli Me Tangere&lt;/i&gt; (Latin for Touch me not) takes place during the country&amp;rsquo;s colonization by Spain, and describes the inequalities of the Spanish Catholic priests and the ruling government. Once banned by Spanish authorities in the Philippines, the work was instrumental in creating a unified Filipino national identity and consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Although originally written in Spanish, the book is more commonly published and read in the Philippines in either Tagalog or English. Compiled and edited by Beatrice Ridgewell, this Anthology preserves both original translations; &lt;i&gt;Noli Me Tangere&lt;/i&gt; (Tagalog), translated by Pascual H. Poblete, and &lt;i&gt;The Social Cancer&lt;/i&gt; (English), by Charles Derbyshire, and is complete with extensive footnotes within each edition." />
