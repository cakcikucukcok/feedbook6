  <title>Animal Ghosts - Elliott O&#39;Donnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Animal Ghosts is a collection of ghost stories in which the antagonists are various animals. Divided up into chapters of ghost sightings by each group of animals, you will hear of hauntings by dogs, cats, birds, jungle animals, etc.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Elliott O&amp;#39;Donnell (27 February 1872 &amp;ndash; 8 May 1965) was an author known primarily for his books about ghosts. He claimed to have seen a ghost, described as an elemental figure covered with spots, when he was five years old. He also claimed to have been strangled by a mysterious phantom in Dublin (however, no permanent effect would seem to have been suffered).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His first book, written in his spare time, was a psychic thriller titled For Satan&amp;#39;s Sake (1904). From this point onward, he became a writer. He wrote several popular novels, including an occult fantasy, The Sorcery Club (1912) but specialized in what were claimed as true stories of ghosts and hauntings. These were immensely popular, but his flamboyant style and amazing stories suggest that he embroidered fact with a romantic flair for fiction. O&amp;#39;Donnell wrote material for numerous magazines, including Hutchinson Story Magazine, The Novel Magazine, The Idler, Weekly Tale-Teller, Hutchinson&amp;#39;s Mystery-Story Magazine, Pearson&amp;#39;s Magazine, Lilliput and Weird Tales.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As he became known as an authority on the supernatural, he was called upon as a ghost hunter. He also lectured and broadcast (radio and television) on the paranormal in Britain and the United States. In addition to his more than 50 books, he wrote scores of articles and stories for national newspapers and magazines. He claimed &amp;quot;I have investigated, sometimes alone, and sometimes with other people and the press, many cases of reputed hauntings. I believe in ghosts but am not a spiritualist.&amp;quot;" />
