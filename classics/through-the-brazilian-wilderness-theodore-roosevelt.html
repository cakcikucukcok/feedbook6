  <title>Through the Brazilian Wilderness - Theodore Roosevelt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1914, with the well-wishes of the Brazilian government, Theodore Roosevelt, ex-president of the United States; his son, Kermit; and Colonel Rondon travel to South America on a quest to course the River of Doubt. While in Brazil, Theodore is also tasked with a &amp;ldquo;zoogeographic reconnaissance&amp;rdquo; of the local wilderness for the archives of the Natural History Museum of New York.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the perils of the incredibly difficult and dangerous terrain, the river was nicknamed &amp;ldquo;The River of Death&amp;rdquo; as a testament to its ferocious rapids. Covering a previously undocumented area of South America, this expedition would be a momentous undertaking and fraught with danger. The expedition, officially named Expedic&amp;atilde;o Scientific Roosevelt-Rondon, was not without incident; men were lost, a cannibalistic tribe tracked the group, and at one point Roosevelt contracted flesh-eating bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the end though, the Roosevelt-Rondon expedition was a success, and the River of Doubt was renamed the Rio Roosevelt in his honor. Written by a city-born boy who grew up to be a true explorer and leader, Roosevelt&amp;rsquo;s Through the Brazilian Wilderness is a unique and important part of history, and it is indicative of the ex-president&amp;rsquo;s true wanderlust and bravery. Candid black-and-white photos from the expedition fill the pages, adding further dimensions to this remarkable journey. Through the Brazilian Wilderness is an engaging must-read for historians, Roosevelt fans, and modern-day explorers alike." />
