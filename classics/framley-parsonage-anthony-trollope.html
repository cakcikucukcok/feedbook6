  <title>Framley Parsonage - Anthony Trollope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fourth in the &lt;i&gt;Chronicles of Barsetshire&lt;/i&gt; (AKA &lt;i&gt;Barchester series&lt;/i&gt;), &amp;quot;Framley Parsonage&amp;quot; was published in 1860. In it the values of a Victorian gentleman, the young clergyman Mark Robarts, are put to the test.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Like much fiction of 19th century England, &amp;quot;Framley Parsonage&amp;quot; concerns property, status, family and the conventions. In it Trollope captures the essence of Victorian England.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Clergyman Mark Robarts benefits from his close friendship with Oxford classmate Lord Lufton. Lufton&amp;#39;s mother bestows upon him the position of vicar of Framley Parsonage. Living among the upper class, but without their wealth, Robarts gets himself into financial difficulty, foolishly allowing himself to be talked into cosigning for a Mr. Sowerby&amp;#39;s substantial borrowing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Meanwhile, Lord Lufton and Mark&amp;#39;s sister Lucy fall in love. However, Lady Lufton opposes the match, as Lucy has no money or social position, and Lucy refuses to marry Lord Lufton without his mother&amp;#39;s approval. Lady Lufton would much rather her son marry Griselda Grantley, daughter of Archdeacon Grantley.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are other subplots as well, for it would be impossible to have a Trollope novel without them. The rich, eccentric Miss Dunstable (introduced in &amp;quot;Doctor Thorne&amp;quot;) is pursued by Sowerby as a means out of his financial dilemma.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the end, Lord Lufton overcomes the resistance of both his mother and Lucy, and saves his future brother-in-law from financial ruin to boot. Miss Dunstable finds happiness as the wife of Doctor Thorne (from the previous novel bearing his name).&lt;br /&gt;
