&lt;p&gt;
Look inside the book: &lt;p&gt;I come here in answer to an advertisement, at great personal inconvenience to myself, and I am shown into a room with a number of most extraordinary characters; and one person, who, I am sure, was the worse for drink, asks me the most impertinent questions, and when I appeal for protection to another individual, he tells me that he has enough to do in attending to his own business without interfering with other people&#39;s, and I have positively to ring the bell twice before I can receive any proper attention.&#39;
...&#39;As for me, I&#39;m not going through the farce of describing the purse I lost, because I know very well you haven&#39;t got it; but I&#39;ll tell you this--I&#39;ve come all the way from Hackney, and I&#39;ve wasted a day, and I don&#39;t mean to leave this house till you&#39;ve paid me my expenses. 
...He wanted me to pin one number to the lot of them; and as I was a-arguing with him, and tryin&#39; to understand how he made out as I could do that, seeing as how the pins was little ones, and the numbers not large ones neither, a lot of other gents came up, and this here young gent he got quite red in the face, and he snatched a number out of my hand and he walked off, and he left me staring.
&lt;p&gt;About Richard Marsh, the Author:&lt;P&gt; A story about a mysterious oriental figure who pursues a British politician to London, where he wreaks havoc with his powers of hypnosis and shape-shifting, Marsh&#39;s novel is of a piece with other sensational turn of the 19th to 20th century fictions such as Stoker&#39;s Dracula, George du Maurier&#39;s Trilby, and Sax Rohmer&#39;s Fu Manchu novels.   Like Dracula and many of the sensation novels pioneered by Wilkie Collins and others in the 1860s, The Beetle is narrated from the perspectives of multiple characters, a technique used in many late 19th-century novels (those of Wilkie Collins and Stoker, for example) to create suspense and to confuse gender boundaries." />
