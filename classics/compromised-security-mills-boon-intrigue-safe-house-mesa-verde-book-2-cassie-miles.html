          &lt;strong&gt;TWO AGENTS REUNITE TO BRING DOWN A KILLER IN COLORADO&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It had been two years since Special Agent Marisa Kelso had seen her ex-partner–and former lover–federal agent Flynn O&#39;Connor. But with the reappearance of an elusive serial killer, Marisa was assigned to Flynn&#39;s team at a Colorado safe house. The attraction between them was still powerful, but Marisa remained focused on keeping their witness safe rather than acting on their sexual impulses. Then, as they closed in on a madman who&#39;d stop at nothing to capture his prey, Marisa became his next target. It was up to Flynn to keep her out of the criminal&#39;s dangerous reach…but what about Flynn&#39;s much too tempting one?&lt;/p&gt;
