        &lt;p&gt;She skidded into town on a bike too powerful for most men, with ten thousand dollars in her saddlebag and a bullet wound in her shoulder. Maggie Randolph was searching for something and running from someone. But she didn&#39;t plan on running into a man she could trust…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;. Timber Falls&#39; deputy sheriff Jesse Tanner had to convince the daredevil beauty that he&#39;d protect her. But first he&#39;d have to catch her–before it was too late.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Jesse was sexy as sin, and chivalrous to boot. But Maggie wasn&#39;t exactly playing by the books in her search for the truth about her father&#39;s murder and her own adoption. Could she share her secrets with Jesse and find solace in his arms for good?&lt;/p&gt;
