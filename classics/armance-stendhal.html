  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Armance - Stendhal</i></b> | Armance was Stendhal's first novel; although not nearly so well-written or interesting as Le Rouge et le Noir, it already foreshadows Stendhal's style in the way it combines a romantic plot with a basically realist (though not quite realistic) social analysis. Unlike the later novel, however, it simply juxtaposes the two rather than truly integrating them.<br /><b><i>Armance by Stendhal - Goodreads</i></b> | Armance is a romance novel set during the Bourbon Restoration by French writer Stendhal, published anonymously in 1827. It was Stendhal's first novel, though he had published essays and critical works on literature, art, and travel since 1815.<br /><b><i>Armance (novel) - Wikipedia</i></b> | "Armance" is an early novel, in which Stendhal explores an uncommon subject, especially for his age: impotence. The novel is far from vulgar or obscene, instead, it depicts a very difficult and painful dilemma, ages before Viagra came to the rescue.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Armance - Stendhal</a> </h3></p><hr/>
