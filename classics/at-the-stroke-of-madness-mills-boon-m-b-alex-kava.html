            &lt;em&gt;FBI Special Agent Maggie O&#39;Dell is just starting a vacation when she gets a call from her friend, psychologist Dr. Gwen Patterson. One of Gwen&#39;s patients is missing on a trip to Connecticut. Can Maggie look into Joan Begley&#39;s disappearance? &lt;/em&gt;
          &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;At first Maggie dismisses Gwen&#39;s concern. But when the body of a woman is discovered in an abandoned rock quarry in Connecticut, Maggie heads to the small town on &quot;unofficial&quot; business. Soon the shocking news surfaces that more bodies have been discovered, and Maggie is drawn into a case that confounds both local law enforcement and a seasoned criminal profiler like herself.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But where is Joan Begley? Is she in fact the woman discovered buried in the quarry? Or is she the unwilling guest of a killer obsessed with possessing an unimaginable prize from his victims?&lt;/p&gt;
