  <title>Eugene Onegin: A Novel in Verse - Alexander Pushkin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Widely acknowledged as the master work of the fountainhead of Russian literature, &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; is a novel in verse, first published serially in 1825. This work, comprised of 389 verses, follows the destinies of three men and three women in imperialist Russia. Eugene is a dandy bored with the social whirl of St. Petersburg, and in moving to the country for a change of scene, he becomes the friend of the poet Lensky, changing their fates dramatically. &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; is narrated by Pushkin himself, though an idealized version who frequently yet entrancingly digresses in the midst of the beauty Tatyana&#39;s embarrassment with Onegin and maturity in the social world. Pushkin, with a tone that is at once satirical and full of storytelling verve, additionally utilizes the characters of Olga, Tatyana&#39;s sister, and a Muse, as well as a wide array of other individuals who enhance the tale&#39;s narrative. Tragically suspenseful, lively, and skillfully rendered, &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; has proven to be not only the favorite work of its author, but a classic of Russian literature." />
