      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;In the Orchard&amp;quot; is a story by Virginia Woolf written and published in 1923. The protagonist is Miranda, in the shade of the apple trees. The reader is immersed, by Virginia Woolf, in a rural context. In this story, the writer performs a real creative literary experiment, (very similar to what was already happening in the pictorial context with the post -impressionism), as there is not a narration and description performed with the usual linear temporal canons (of &amp;quot;before&amp;quot;and &amp;quot;after&amp;quot;, of the past and of the future), but a sort of moving paintings, through which the narration is based on space and sound .. Through space and sound, therefore, Miranda, reconnects herself&amp;nbsp; with the rest of the world and will be transported from the boundless land to the sea." />
