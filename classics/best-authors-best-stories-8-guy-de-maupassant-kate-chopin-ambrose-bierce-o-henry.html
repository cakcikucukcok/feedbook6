      <meta name="description" content="A Blunder&lt;br /&gt;
by Anton Chekhov&lt;br /&gt;
ILYA SERGEITCH PEPLOV and his wife Kleopatra Petrovna were standing at the door, listening greedily. On the other side in the little drawing-room a love scene was apparently taking place between two persons: their daughter Natashenka and a teacher of the district school, called Shchupkin.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;He&amp;#39;s rising!&amp;quot; whispered Peplov, quivering with impatience and rubbing his hands. &amp;quot;Now, Kleopatra, mind; as soon as they begin talking of their feelings, take down the ikon from the wall and we&amp;#39;ll go in and bless them. . . . We&amp;#39;ll catch him. . . . A blessing with an ikon is sacred and binding. . . He couldn&amp;#39;t get out of it, if he brought it into court.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
On the other side of the door this was the conversation:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t go on like that!&amp;quot; said Shchupkin, striking a match against his checked trousers. &amp;quot;I never wrote you any letters!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I like that! As though I didn&amp;#39;t know your writing!&amp;quot; giggled the girl with an affected shriek, continually peeping at herself in the glass. &amp;quot;I knew it at once! And what a queer man you are! You are a writing master, and you write like a spider! How can you teach writing if you write so badly yourself?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;H&amp;#39;m! . . . That means nothing. The great thing in writing lessons is not the hand one writes, but keeping the boys in order. You hit one on the head with a ruler, make another kneel down. . . . Besides, there&amp;#39;s nothing in handwriting! Nekrassov was an author, but his handwriting&amp;#39;s a disgrace, there&amp;#39;s a specimen of it in his collected works.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You are not Nekrassov. . . .&amp;quot; (A sigh). &amp;quot;I should love to marry an author. He&amp;#39;d always be writing poems to me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I can write you a poem, too, if you like.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What can you write about?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Love -- passion -- your eyes. You&amp;#39;ll be crazy when you read it. It would draw a tear from a stone! And if I write you a real poem, will you let me kiss your hand?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s nothing much! You can kiss it now if you like.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Shchupkin jumped up, and making sheepish eyes, bent over the fat little hand that smelt of egg soap.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Take down the ikon,&amp;quot; Peplov whispered in a fluster, pale with excitement, and buttoning his coat as he prodded his wife with his elbow. &amp;quot;Come along, now!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
And without a second&amp;#39;s delay Peplov flung open the door.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Children,&amp;quot; he muttered, lifting up his arms and blinking tearfully, &amp;quot;the Lord bless you, my children. May you live -- be fruitful -- and multiply.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And -- and I bless you, too,&amp;quot; the mamma brought out, crying with happiness. &amp;quot;May you be happy, my dear ones! Oh, you are taking from me my only treasure!&amp;quot; she said to Shchupkin. &amp;quot;Love my girl, be good to her. . . .&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Shchupkin&amp;#39;s mouth fell open with amazement and alarm. The parents&amp;#39; attack was so bold and unexpected that he could not utter a single word.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m in for it! I&amp;#39;m spliced!&amp;quot; he thought, going limp with horror. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s all over with you now, my boy! There&amp;#39;s no escape!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
