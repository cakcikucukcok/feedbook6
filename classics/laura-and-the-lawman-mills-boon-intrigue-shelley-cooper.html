          &lt;strong&gt;Police officer Laura Langley&#39;s objective was clear: pose as art appraiser Ruby O&#39;Toole and infiltrate suspected drug kingpin Joseph Merrill&#39;s organization. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Yet thoughts of another man consumed her day and night. Joseph&#39;s mysterious employee Michael Corsi had a sensual stare that made Laura forget her purpose, his magnetism threatening her guarded heart. With the undercover investigation at stake, Laura had to resist the desire Michael awakened in her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because she knew how deadly falling for a man who might be on the wrong side of the law could be. Then she discovered that she wasn&#39;t the only one masquerading. But with their covers nearly blown, would their passion survive another night?&lt;/p&gt;
