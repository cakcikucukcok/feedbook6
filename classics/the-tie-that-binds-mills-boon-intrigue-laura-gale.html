  <title>The Tie That Binds (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - Laura Gale</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;When she walked out, Rachel thought she was through with Lucas Neuman and his high-society family forever.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But that was before her little girl became deathly ill…before the man who&#39;d so cruelly betrayed her became her only salvation. Five years apart hadn&#39;t eased the pain of Rachel&#39;s leaving…or the fierce desire that coursed through Lucas when he saw her again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But it was desperation that brought her to his door: only a bone marrow transplant would save their little girl - the daughter he hadn&#39;t known he had. Now time was running out. Was it possible to heal the pain of the past and start over with this woman he had never stopped loving?&lt;/p&gt;
