          &lt;strong&gt;Redheads like Maggie O&#39;Connell are nothing but trouble. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But Trace Rawlins, a former army ranger turned private investigator, takes the case anyway. After all, he knows a thing or two about women. Trace can sense that something is wrong—Maggie isn&#39;t telling him everything. If these menacing calls and messages are real, why won&#39;t the police help her? And if they aren&#39;t real, what is she hiding?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As Trace digs deeper to find the source of Maggie&#39;s threats, he discovers a secret that no one was meant to uncover. And the only puzzle left to be solved is whether the danger comes from an unknown stalker…or from the woman he&#39;s trying his hardest not to fall for.&lt;/p&gt;
