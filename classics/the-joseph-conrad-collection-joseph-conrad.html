  <title>The Joseph Conrad Collection - Joseph Conrad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Joseph Conrad&amp;nbsp;was a&amp;nbsp;Polish-British&amp;nbsp;writer regarded as one of the greatest novelists to write in the English language. Though he did not speak English fluently until his twenties, he was a master prose stylist who brought a non-English sensibility into&amp;nbsp;English literature. Conrad wrote stories and novels, many with a nautical setting, that depict trials of the human spirit in the midst of what he saw as an impassive, inscrutable universe.&lt;br /&gt;
Conrad is considered an early&amp;nbsp;modernist, though his works contain elements of 19th-century&amp;nbsp;realism. His narrative style and&amp;nbsp;anti-heroic&amp;nbsp;characters have influenced numerous authors, and many films have been adapted from, or inspired by, his works. Numerous writers and critics have commented that Conrad&amp;#39;s fictional works, written largely in the first two decades of the 20th century, seem to have anticipated later world events.&lt;br /&gt;
Writing near the peak of the&amp;nbsp;British Empire, Conrad drew, among other things, on his native Poland&amp;#39;s national experiences and on his own experiences in the French and British&amp;nbsp;merchant navies, to create short stories and novels that reflect aspects of a European-dominated world&amp;mdash;including&amp;nbsp;imperialism&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;colonialism&amp;mdash;and that profoundly explore the human&amp;nbsp;psyche." />
