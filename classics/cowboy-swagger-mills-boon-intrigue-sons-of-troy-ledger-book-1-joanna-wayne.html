  <title>Cowboy Swagger (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Sons of Troy Ledger, Book 1) - Joanna Wayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Of the five brothers only Dylan Ledger returned to their hometown of Mustang Run. &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But he was met by bad memories and hostile neighbors—except for Collette McGuire. The daughter of the sheriff was the last person he expected to have on his side—and the one who needed him most. Collette had nowhere to go when her secret admirer turned violent stalker—except to Dylan.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His arms became her haven, his lips her salvation. As old family secrets and feuds threatened to erupt, they knew they were both in for a wild ride. But this cowboy wasn&#39;t about to let anything throw him off course… or keep Collette out of his bed…&lt;/p&gt;
