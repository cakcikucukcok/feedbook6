  <title>The Mad Professor of Babeldu - Adamu Kyuka Usman Lilymjok</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Mad Professor of Babeldu is a work of fiction with an eccentric professor as its major character. Sitting alone in his farmhouse, Professor Philjez, in a profound and sometimes comic manner, talks on a variety of issues from politics to religion, economics, culture, science, and a myriad of other issues. This book no doubt will resonate with many readers because of its unusual character and profound ideas. 
Bizarre, comical, shocking, profound, and perhaps blasphemous are all adjectives aptly descriptive of The Mad Professor of Babeldu. Driven by Professor Philjez, its eccentric major character, this book despairs and inspires, saddens and excites, frightens and soothes, sobers and intoxicates a reader. It is a mixed grille. It is a jolly, hearty party of ideas that cannot fail to go away with gold medals in any Olympic contest of ideas." />
