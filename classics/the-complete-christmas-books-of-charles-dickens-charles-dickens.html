      <meta name="description" content="While readers will be most familiar with &quot;The Christmas Carol&quot; in which Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by four ghosts who endeavor to show him the error of his miserly ways just in time for Christmas, Dickens also wrote four other Christmas themed books.
