          &lt;strong&gt;HER INHERITANCE CAME WITH AN ENIGMATIC STRANGER&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A powerful storm delivered heiress Stacy Ashford into the iron-hard embrace of a shadowy stranger, a man as rough-hewn as the craggy Colorado mountains. But their meeting seemed more fate than chance. Gaining her inheritance depended on Stacy&#39;s rebuilding the eerie hotel where Josh Spencer&#39;s sister had died. And though she shouldn&#39;t trust Josh&#39;s motives for helping her, his commanding presence kept her strong when someone–or some&lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;–tried to scare her off. Then the incidents turned deadly….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;She was Josh&#39;s means to end the search for his sister&#39;s killer, and a threat to the posted No Trespassing sign on his heart. But Stacy&#39;s inheritance bound them in an ever-tightening coil of danger–and what destiny joins, let no man, ghost or killer put asunder….&lt;/p&gt;
