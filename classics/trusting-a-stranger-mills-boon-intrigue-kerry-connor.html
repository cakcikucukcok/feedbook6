  <title>Trusting a Stranger (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - Kerry Connor</title>

          &lt;strong&gt;Luke Hubbard never claimed to have a soft spot for damsels in distress.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But the moment he set eyes on Karina Fedrova, a mysterious beauty with assassins on her trail, turning her away was impossible. And a marriage of convenience the only way he could guarantee her safety. Keeping one step ahead of the men who thought Karina&#39;s secrets were worth dying for, Luke found himself forgetting their nuptials were just an act.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because the way his blood stirred around this stranger couldn&#39;t be faked, and her vulnerability simply made him want to carry her to their marital bed and claim her as his own. However, keeping his libido in check was crucial to Karina&#39;s survival…and the only way to prevent Luke from repeating the tragic mistakes of his past.&lt;/p&gt;
