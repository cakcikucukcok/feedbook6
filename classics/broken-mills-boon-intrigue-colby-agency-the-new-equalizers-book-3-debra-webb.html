  <title>Broken (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Colby Agency: The New Equalizers, Book 3) - Debra Webb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;After seven years of agony, Linc Reece was certain he&#39;d found his dead wife– alive and living in a tiny Tennessee town. He was sure Mia Grant was Lori, the wife he&#39;d lost in an undercover case gone bad. Now the operative for the elite team of Equalizers had to prove it…even if he had to kidnap her.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mia Grant saw the hope in Linc&#39;s eyes… but just because she liked vanilla, blues and old houses didn&#39;t make her his long-lost wife. Nothing about him was familiar, except the sizzle she felt when they touched. But when they discovered Lori&#39;s records destroyed and her photos stolen, even Mia knew someone had gone to great lengths to make her forget. And he&#39;d do anything to ensure she never remembered….&lt;/p&gt;
