          &lt;em&gt;His only job was to protect her–not to get her into bed&lt;/em&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When his coinvestigator was attacked just moments after Detective Nick Fensom left the scene, he swore he&#39;d never let her get hurt again. Thanks to their tense relationship, criminologist Annie Hermann wasn&#39;t happy to have Nick as her newly appointed protector. And although Nick couldn&#39;t blame her, being together 24/7 caused him to see Annie in a whole new light. Before long, he couldn&#39;t stop picturing the beautiful brunette wrapped up in his arms–and in his sheets. But allowing unfamiliar feelings to get in the way of the job was completely unprofessional…especially once Annie discovered the evidence that could cost her her life.&lt;/p&gt;
