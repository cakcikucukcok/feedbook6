  <title>Love and Friendship, Three Sisters, and A Collection of Letters - Jane Austen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Although the four novels published in her lifetime were well-received, much of Jane Austen&#39;s notoriety came about after her death. Her decision to publish anonymously was a standard for women in the early 19th Century, and furnished one of the most beloved writers in English literature little personal acclaim during her life. The stories in this collection are some of Austen&#39;s earliest writings, originally compiled by the author in her three-volume set, &quot;Juvenilia&quot;. Although the charm of these pieces may not be appreciated by all Austen enthusiasts, they are an invaluable glimpse into the early talent of Austen, and her development as a poet, satirist, playwright and novelist. This edition has corrected some of the author&#39;s intentional misspellings for ease of the modern reader, in particular the word &quot;Freindship&quot; in Love and Friendship, however it should be noted that her quaint or misspellings and odd capitalizations were intended as a parody of the Romantic novels Austen read as a child." />
