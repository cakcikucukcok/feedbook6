While there, he got a magical talisman in the form of a mummified monkey&amp;#39;s paw, said to grant three wishes to whoever possesses it. Having no desire to keep the paw, he (reluctantly) gives it to the Whites, first warning them that its previous owners killed themselves for their third wish. Too excited by its mystical powers, Mr. White first wishes for &amp;pound;200. He gets his wish, but at a horrible price. The story continues this way until the most dramatic moment, and they learn their lesson: don&amp;#39;t tempt fate, and Be Careful What You Wish For." />
