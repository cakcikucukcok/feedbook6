As Essai is French for &amp;quot;trial&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;attempt&amp;quot;, so Montaigne attempted to explore his thoughts, his life and learning in written form. His essays are widely regarded as the predecessor of the modern essay: a focused treatment of issues, events and concerns past, present and future.&amp;nbsp;" />
