  <title>We&#39;re in It for Life - Julie Dennis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The season of your childhood should be the best season of your life... memories that will live with you forever, friends that you could not imagine living one day of your life without...&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But just as the seasons change, so does life, friends and experiences. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Just when you think that you have met the one person that you want to spend the rest of your life with...&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Jackie Garrett meets and falls in love with the man of her dreams Deon Davis, only to find out that he has a past. Her past has come back to haunt her as well.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Why did this happen now, now that everything seems so perfect? Why did Michael have to come back to ruin her relationship after all these years?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Her decision will not only affect her... but, the future of them all.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What happened with Michael was so long ago... I guess the saying is true. &quot;what goes around, comes around&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Now that Michael has returned, Jackie has been forced to make some decisions. The chain of events that is about to unfold will definitely have a devastating impact on all of their lives.&lt;/P&gt;
