Set in Berkshire, England, during World War I, The Fox, like many of D. H. Lawrence's other major works, deals with the psychological relationships of three protagonists in a triangle of love and hatred. Without the help of any male laborers, Nellie March and Jill Banford struggle to maintain a marginal livelihood at the Bailey Farm.<br /><b><i>The Fox (novella) - Wikipedia</i></b> | Based on D.H. Lawrence 's novella about two young women - sickly, chattering Jill Banford and quiet, strong Ellen March - who are trying, hopelessly, to run a chicken farm in Canada. A gentle but powerful man named Paul Grenfell who used to live on their farm returns and puts things in order.<br /><b><i>The Fox (1967) - IMDb</i></b> | One of D. H. Lawrence's fable-like tales addressing gender roles and relationships, The Fox is developed based on the symbol of a female-centric farm beset by a "demon," a marauding male fox. Owned and run by two women, the "small, thin, delicate thing," Banford, and "the man about the place," March, the farm is remarkably unproductive.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>The Fox - D.
