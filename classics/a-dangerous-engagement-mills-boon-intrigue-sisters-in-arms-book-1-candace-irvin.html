  <title>A Dangerous Engagement (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Sisters in Arms, Book 1) - Candace Irvin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;Lieutenant Anna Shale had taken on enough dangerous assignments to know how to play the game - and win.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But when she was asked to investigate her own criminal cousin, Anna&#39;s ability to remain impartial was put to the test. And when she was confronted by her cousin&#39;s mysterious right-hand man, Anna felt trouble brewing both in her mission and her heart….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Delta Force Major Tom Wild had enough to worry about as he worked undercover to bring down the man who had destroyed his friend&#39;s life. Dwelling on Anna&#39;s betrayal wouldn&#39;t get him the answers he needed - until he learned the truth behind Anna Shale and realized she had the power to rock his well-ordered life to the core.&lt;/p&gt;
