  <title>MR PICKWICK&#39;S CHRISTMAS - the Pickwickians spend Christmas at the manor farm in Dingley Dell - Charles Dickens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;MR. PICKWICK&amp;#39;S CHRISTMAS&lt;/b&gt; is an account of the Pickwickians&amp;#39; Christmas at the manor farm in Dingley Dell near Rochester, Kent; and of the adventures they have there one Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;
The first adventure is The Tale of the Goblin who stole a sexton; the second tells of The famous sports on ice, as written in the Pickwick Papers. a novel by Charles Dickens. This small volume has been illustrated in colour and Pen-and-ink by George Alfred Williams.&lt;br /&gt;
This is a fun little Christmas book. Enjoyable to read out loud during the Christmas season and a welcome change to Dickens&amp;rsquo; staple of modern Christmases worldwide - A Christmas Carol.&lt;br /&gt;
