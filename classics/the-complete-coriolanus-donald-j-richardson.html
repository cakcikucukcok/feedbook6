  <title>The Complete Coriolanus - Donald J. Richardson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Coriolanus is a man afflicted by a tragic flaw: Hubris (Hybris), overweening pride. His thoughts are immediately expressed in his speech, never mind the setting or the audience. This, combined with his near total naivete, leads to his downfall, especially when confronted by the machinations of Brutus and Sicinius. Despite the wise advice given him by his mother, his wife, and his friend Menenius, he indulges himself by giving expression to his umbrage-deserved, no doubt but ill-advised nevertheless. He is the epitome of self-indulgent pride. Thus, he dooms himself through his own impulsive behavior, especially his speech." />
