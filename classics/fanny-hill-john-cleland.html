  <title>Fanny Hill - John Cleland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fanny Hill is an erotic novel by English novelist John Cleland. Written while the author was in debtors&amp;#39; prison in London, it is considered &amp;quot;the first original English prose pornography, and the first pornography to use the form of the novel&amp;quot;. One of the most prosecuted and banned books in history, it has become a synonym for obscenity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book is written as a series of letters from Frances &amp;quot;Fanny&amp;quot; Hill to an unknown woman, with Fanny justifying her life-choices to this individual. At the beginning of her tale, Fanny Hill is a young girl with a rudimentary education living in a small village near Liverpool. Shortly after she turns 15, both her parents die. Esther Davis, a girl from Fanny&amp;#39;s village who has since moved to London, convinces Fanny to move to the city as well, but Esther abandons Fanny once they arrive. Fanny hopes to find work as a maid, and is hired by Mrs. Brown, a woman she believes to be a wealthy lady. Mrs. Brown is in fact a madam (pimp) and intends the innocent Fanny to work for her as a prostitute. Mrs. Brown&amp;#39;s associate, Phoebe Ayers, shares a bed with Fanny and introduces her to sexual pleasure. Mrs. Brown plans to sell Fanny&amp;#39;s virginity to an ugly old man, but Fanny is repulsed by the man and struggles with him. She is saved from rape by Mrs. Brown&amp;#39;s maid. After this ordeal, Fanny falls into a fever for several days. Mrs. Brown, realizing that Fanny&amp;#39;s virginity is still intact, decides to sell Fanny&amp;#39;s sexual favors to the exceedingly rich Lord B., who is due to arrive in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fanny spies on Mrs. Brown having sex with a large, muscular man. She talks to Phoebe, who assures her that it is possible for a young girl to have sex with a well-endowed man. She takes Fanny to spy on another prostitute, Polly Phillips, having sex with a handsome and well-endowed young Genovese merchant. Afterward, Phoebe and Fanny engage in mutual masturbation and Fanny looks forward to her first time having sex with a man." />
