        &lt;p&gt;It was a powerful Rocky Mountain blizzard that caught scientist Shana Parisi unawares and threw her into the arms of a mysterious man in uniform.

        &lt;p&gt;Luke knew bringing the beautiful Shana home posed a threat to his secrets, but a foreign enemy was hot on their trail and Shana&#39;s snowy footprints were all they needed to track her down. Once entrenched in his world, Luke urged her to remain silent about what she saw. Because the alternative could be deadly….&lt;/p&gt;
