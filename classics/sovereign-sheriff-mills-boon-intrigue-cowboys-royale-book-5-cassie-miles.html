  <title>Sovereign Sheriff (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Cowboys Royale, Book 5) - Cassie Miles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;As sheriff, the law guided his decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a man protecting a princess, his libido seemed to be in control…&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Sheriff Jake Wolf took pride in two things: his Native American heritage and his adherence to the law. So when Princess Saida Khalid came to him, desperate for answers to an unsolved case, Jake stuck to the facts–and tried not to get distracted by what he wanted. But ignoring Saida&#39;s gorgeous features and whip–smart mind were nearly impossible, especially when she claimed he was the only person who could keep her safe. Jake had every intention of maintaining a professional distance…even though he ached to hold her and promise everything would be okay. But remaining alert had to be his priority. And one touch would never be enough.&lt;/p&gt;

Note: Mostly a stands alone book. 5th in the multi-author, Cowboys Royale series. EASY READ. Starts out as a typical “royal” storyline but takes a slight jog at the end, engaging characters, menacing bad guys, diverse supporting cast, and kudos to the author for writing a sweet, slow-paced, romantic journey instead of a jump-in-bed, lust-a-thon.<br /><b><i>Sovereign Sheriff (Cowboys Royale Book 5) - Kindle edition ...</i></b> | Sovereign Sheriff (Cowboys Royale Book 5) ...
