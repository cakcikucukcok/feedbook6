  <title>The House With The Mezzanine - Anton Chekhov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Young upper class artist believes in not helping the poor while spending his days doing nothing of consequence, essentially living a futile existence. Lida is his polar opposite and argues with him as she organizes subscription campaigns for the poor, makes charity drives, and tries to change the local government. Lida’s younger sister Genya is vacant and undeveloped, both physically and emotionally. She can be easily swayed by either Lida or the artist, depending on the day. There&#39;s a sense of romance in the air, but heated debates always seem to prevent this fragile romance developing any further." />
