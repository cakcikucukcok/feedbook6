  <title>Nightmare Abbey - Thomas Love Peacock</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;Nightmare Abbey&amp;quot;, like &amp;quot;Frankenstein&amp;quot;, appeared in 1818. Strangely, it was also inspired by Shelley, who was friends with Peacock. His satire, however, was lighthearted and whimsical and a kind of in-joke. There&amp;#39;s no way of knowing if Peacock had actually read Mary Shelley&amp;#39;s novel, but &amp;quot;Nightmare Abbey&amp;quot; makes a nice counterpoint, and speaks of the importance of a new audience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Peacock&amp;acute;s best-known work, &amp;quot;Nightmare Abbey&amp;quot;, romantic melancholy is satirised. The novel &amp;nbsp;is set in a former abbey whose owner, Christopher Glowry, is host to visitors who enjoy his hospitality and engage in endless debate. Among these guests are figures recognisable to Peacock&amp;#39;s contemporaries, including characters based on Lord Byron and Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Mr. Glowry&amp;#39;s son Scythrop (also modelled on a famous Romantic, Peacock&amp;#39;s friend Percy Bysshe Shelley) locks himself up in a tower where he reads German tragedies and transcendental philosophy and develops a &amp;quot;passion for reforming the world.&amp;quot; Disappointed in love, a sorrowful Scythrop decides the only thing to do is to commit suicide, but circumstances persuade him to instead follow his father in a love of misanthropy and Madeira. In addition to satire and comic romance, &amp;quot;Nightmare Abbey&amp;quot; presents a biting critique of the texts we view as central to British romanticism.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The great pleasure of &amp;quot;Nightmare Abbey&amp;quot;, lies in the delight the author takes in poking fun at the romantic movement." />

An excellent poet, too.<br /><b><i>Nightmare Abbey: Peacock, Thomas Love: 9781511698955 ...</i></b> | Nightmare Abbey was written in 1818 by Thomas Love Peacock.
