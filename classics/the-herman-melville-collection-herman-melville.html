  <title>The Herman Melville Collection - Herman Melville</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Herman Melville was an American novelist, short story writer, and poet of the&amp;nbsp;American Renaissance&amp;nbsp;period. Among his best known works are&amp;nbsp;Typee, a romantic account of his experiences of&amp;nbsp;Polynesian&amp;nbsp;life, and his whaling novel&amp;nbsp;Moby-Dick.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Melville was born in New York City, the third child of a merchant who dealt in French dry goods and his wife. Years as a common sailor from 1839 to 1844 were the basis of his early writings. His first book was&amp;nbsp;Typee, a highly romanticized account of his life among Polynesians. It became such a best-seller that he wrote the sequel&amp;nbsp;Omoo. These successes gave him the financial basis to marry&amp;nbsp;Elizabeth Shaw, daughter of a prominent Boston family, but the success proved hard to sustain. His first novel that was not based on his own experiences was&amp;nbsp;Mardi, a sea narrative that develops into a philosophical allegory&amp;mdash;but it was not well received. He received warmer reviews for&amp;nbsp;Redburn, a story of life on a merchant ship, and his 1850 description of the harsh life aboard a man-of-war in&amp;nbsp;White-Jacket, but they did not provide financial security.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Moby-Dick, although now considered one of the great American novels, was not well received, and critics scorned his psychological novel,&amp;nbsp;Pierre: or, The Ambiguities. From 1853 to 1856, Melville published short fiction in magazines, most notably &amp;quot;Bartleby, the Scrivener&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;The Encantadas&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Benito Cereno&amp;quot;. These and three other stories were collected in 1856 as&amp;nbsp;The Piazza Tales. In 1857, he traveled to England and then toured the&amp;nbsp;Near East.&amp;nbsp;The Confidence-Man was the last prose work that he published.&amp;nbsp;" />
