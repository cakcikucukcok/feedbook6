        &lt;p&gt;Slade Keaton was the man Maggie James fell in love with…until she learned he was a lie. Escaping a hit meant for him, she found herself on the run–fleeing a danger she couldn&#39;t comprehend with a man she couldn&#39;t trust. And pregnant with his baby.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Though he&#39;d had dozens of aliases, Slade couldn&#39;t forget who he was–the son of a merciless assassin named the Dragon. He&#39;d kept out of his mother&#39;s reach for years till a Colby Agency investigation put him–and Maggie–on her radar. Now, could Slade become the very thing he hated in order to save the woman and child he loved?&lt;/p&gt;
