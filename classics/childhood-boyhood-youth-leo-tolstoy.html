  <title>Childhood - Boyhood - Youth -  Leo Tolstoy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Leo Tolstoy began his trilogy, Childhood, Boyhood, Youth, in his early twenties. Although he would in his old age famously dismiss it as an &amp;#39;awkward mixture of fact and fiction&amp;#39;, generations of readers have not agreed, finding the novelS to be a charming and insightful portrait of inner growth against the background of a world limned with extraordinary clarity, grace and colour. Evident too in its brilliant account of a young person&amp;#39;s emerging awareness of the world and of his place within it are many of the stances, techniques and themes that would come to full flower in the immortal War and Peace and Anna Karenina, and in the other great works of Tolstoy&amp;#39;s maturity.&lt;br /&gt;
Published when Tolstoy was just twenty-three years old, the book was an immediate success, earning notice from other Russian novelists including Ivan Turgenev, who heralded the young Tolstoy as a major up-and-coming figure in Russian literature." />

  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Childhood - Boyhood - Youth -  Leo Tolstoy</i></b> | Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth were Tolstoy's first published works; they are loosely based on his early life up to his university days, told from the perspective of a boy named Nikolenka as he makes his way through the joys and miseries of childhood and early adulthood.<br /><b><i>Childhood, Boyhood, Youth by Leo Tolstoy - Goodreads</i></b> | Tolstoy's first published work, completed in 1856, "Childhood, Boyhood, Youth" recounts his early life up to his university days. These are not memoirs in the strict sense of the word, as the author's Stendhalian take on the autobiographical genre confronts and blurs the notions of reality and imagination, combining nostalgic anecdote with frank personal assessment and philosophical extrapolation.<br /><b><i>'Childhood', 'Boyhood' and 'Youth': An Autobiographical ...</i></b> | Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth is that work which stands on the periphery, not only of Tolstoy's works but also of Russian literature in general. It feels Russian, the characters are Russians but the influences come from French literature (Rousseau) and Germany (Schiller, Goethe).<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Childhood - Boyhood - Youth -  Leo Tolstoy</a> </h3></p><hr/>
