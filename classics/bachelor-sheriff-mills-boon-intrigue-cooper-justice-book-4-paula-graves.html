  <title>Bachelor Sheriff (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (Cooper Justice, Book 4) - Paula Graves</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;A man of duty and justice, Sheriff Aaron Cooper can&#39;t foresee trading his bachelor ways for love. So when he offers an innocent Melissa Draper protection, he doesn&#39;t realize what he&#39;s signed up for.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;His cop instincts urge him to stop at nothing to keep the beautiful, passionate woman safe. But the fact that she&#39;s suddenly become a target makes him wonder just what she&#39;s hiding–from him and from the investigation. Slowly, as Melissa opens up and reveals the horrors of her violent past, Aaron&#39;s heart races with the need to make her forget. Even if that means keeping her with him, away from danger… night after night….&lt;/p&gt;
