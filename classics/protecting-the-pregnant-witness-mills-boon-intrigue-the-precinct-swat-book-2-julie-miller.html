  <title>Protecting the Pregnant Witness (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (The Precinct: SWAT, Book 2) - Julie Miller</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;A ruthless killer…an expectant mother…one determined cop.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Rafe Delgado had been there for Josie Nichols her entire life. So when he turned to her one night, emotionally drained thanks to a heartbreaking case, her longtime crush on the brooding cop reached a whole new level. But afterward, Rafe went back to being untouchable and Josie didn&#39;t know how to break through his shell…even to tell him she was pregnant.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Everything Rafe did was by the book and so his moment of weakness could never be repeated. He didn&#39;t deserve someone like Josie.even if it was a daily struggle to keep his hands off her. But learning she could ID a cold&amp;#150;blooded killer changed everything. Now she was in his protective custody and caring about her only made his job harder. And learning about his unborn child made it nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
