  <title>Love of Life &amp; Other Stories - Jack London</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Jack London&lt;/i&gt; was one of the first writers to earn a living in part from his writings in commercial fiction magazines. London became a socialist and his writings reflect this change in his political views. He is best known for his novels The Call of the Wild and White Fang. Stories in this collection include LOVE OF LIFE, A DAY&amp;#39;S LODGING, THE WHITE MAN&amp;#39;S WAY, THE STORY OF KEESH, THE UNEXPECTED, BROWN WOLF, THE SUN-DOG TRAIL, NEGORE, and THE COWARD,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;LOVE OF LIFE&lt;/b&gt; (excerpt)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;This out of all will remain - They have lived and have tossed: So much of the game will be gain, Though the gold of the dice has been lost.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THEY limped painfully down the bank, and once the foremost of the two men staggered among the rough-strewn rocks. They were tired and weak, and their faces had the drawn expression of patience which comes of hardship long endured. They were heavily burdened with blanket packs which were strapped to their shoulders. Head- straps, passing across the forehead, helped support these packs. Each man carried a rifle. They walked in a stooped posture, the shoulders well forward, the head still farther forward, the eyes bent upon the ground.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I wish we had just about two of them cartridges that&amp;#39;s layin&amp;#39; in that cache of ourn,&amp;quot; said the second man.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His voice was utterly and drearily expressionless. He spoke without enthusiasm; and the first man, limping into the milky stream that foamed over the rocks, vouchsafed no reply.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The other man followed at his heels. They did not remove their foot-gear, though the water was icy cold - so cold that their ankles ached and their feet went numb. In places the water dashed against their knees, and both men staggered for footing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The man who followed slipped on a smooth boulder, nearly fell, but recovered himself with a violent effort, at the same time uttering a sharp exclamation of pain. He seemed faint and dizzy and put out his free hand while he reeled, as though seeking support against the air. When he had steadied himself he stepped forward, but reeled again and nearly fell. Then he stood still and looked at the other man, who had never turned his head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The man stood still for fully a minute, as though debating with himself. Then he called out:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I say, Bill, I&amp;#39;ve sprained my ankle.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bill staggered on through the milky water. He did not look around. The man watched him go, and though his face was expressionless as ever, his eyes were like the eyes of a wounded deer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The other man limped up the farther bank and continued straight on without looking back. The man in the stream watched him. His lips trembled a little, so that the rough thatch of brown hair which covered them was visibly agitated. His tongue even strayed out to moisten them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Bill!&amp;quot; he cried out...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;About Jack London:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jack London (1876-1916), was an American author and a pioneer in the then-burgeoning world of commercial magazine fiction. He was one of the first Americans to make a lucrative career exclusively from writing. London was self-educated. He taught himself in the public library, mainly just by reading books. In 1898, he began struggling seriously to break into print, a struggle memorably described in his novel, Martin Eden (1909). Jack London was fortunate in the timing of his writing career. He started just as new printing technologies enabled lower-cost production of magazines. This resulted in a boom in popular magazines aimed at a wide public, and a strong market for short fiction. In 1900, he made $2,500 in writing, the equivalent of about $75,000 today. His career was well under way." />
