  <title>Rafe Sinclair&#39;s Revenge (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - Gayle Wilson</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;HE WOULD NEVER FORGET…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The destruction of the U.S. embassy in Amsterdam had left ex-CIA operative Rafe Sinclair with flashbacks of the unspeakable horrors he&#39;d witnessed that night, and forced him to abandon the job he&#39;d dedicated his life to. His only consolation had been that the terrorist behind the attack was dead–killed by Rafe&#39;s own hand.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Now, six years later, someone was trying to convince Rafe that the terrorist was alive. And that someone was targeting the one person who could draw Rafe Sinclair back into the game–Elizabeth Richards. Elizabeth and Rafe had once been partners and lovers, and he would give up everything to keep her safe–everything. And it looked as though, this time, that was exactly what it was going to take!&lt;/p&gt;
