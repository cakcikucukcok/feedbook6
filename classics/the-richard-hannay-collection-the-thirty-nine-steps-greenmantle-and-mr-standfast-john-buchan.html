  <title>The Richard Hannay Collection: The Thirty Nine Steps, Greenmantle and Mr Standfast - John Buchan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Major General Sir Richard Hannay is a fictional secret agent created by Scottish novelist John Buchan and made further popular by the 1935 Alfred Hitchcock film &lt;i&gt;The 39 Steps&lt;/i&gt;. Buchan&amp;rsquo;s resourceful, German-speaking spy is partly based on Edmund Ironside, from Edinburgh, an espionage operative during the Second Boer War.&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;The Richard Hannay Collection &amp;ndash; The 39 Steps, Greenmantle and Mr Standfast&lt;/i&gt; presents the first and best three Richard Hannay adventures:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Thirty Nine Steps&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hannay arrives in London on the eve of World War I, where he meets an American agent seeking help in stopping a political assassination. Before long, Hannay finds himself in possession of a little black book that holds the key to the conspiracy &amp;mdash; and on the run from both the police and members of a mysterious organization that will stop at nothing to keep their secrets hidden.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Greenmantle&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hannay is called in to investigate rumors of an uprising in the Muslim world, and undertakes a perilous journey through enemy territory to meet his friend Sandy in Constantinople. Once there, he and his friends must thwart the Germans&amp;#39; plans to use religion to help them win the war, climaxing at the battle of Erzurum.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Mr Standfast&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Recalled from duty on the Western Front by spymaster Sir Walter Bullivant, Hannay goes undercover as a pacifist, working to outwit a dangerous German spy and his agents. Guided by his contact&amp;mdash;and love interest&amp;mdash;Mary Lamington, Hannay tracks his enemy from London to Glasgow to the Scottish Highlands, eventually confronting him in a dramatic climax above the battlefields of Europe. The title refers to a character in John Bunyan&amp;#39;s &lt;i&gt;Pilgrim&amp;#39;s Progress&lt;/i&gt;, to which there are many other references in the novel; Hannay uses a copy of &lt;i&gt;Pilgrim&amp;#39;s Progress&lt;/i&gt; to decipher coded messages from his contacts, and letters from his friend Peter Pienaar.&lt;br /&gt;
