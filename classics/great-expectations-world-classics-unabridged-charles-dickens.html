  <title>Great Expectations (World Classics, Unabridged) - Charles Dickens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was now too late and too far to go back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and the world lay spread before me’
A terrifying encounter with an escaped convict in a graveyard on the wild Kent marshes; a summons to meet the bitter, decaying Miss Havisham and her beautiful, cold-hearted ward Estella; the sudden generosity of a mysterious benefactor – these form a series of events that change the orphaned Pip’s life forever, and he eagerly abandons his humble origins to begin a new life as a gentleman. Dickens’s haunting late novel depicts Pip’s education and development through adversity as he discovers the true nature of his ‘great expectations’." />
