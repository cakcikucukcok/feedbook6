  <title>Three by Twain: Tom Sawyer, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, and A Connecticut Yankee In King Arther&#39;s Court - Mark Twain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This collection includes three of classic American author Mark Twain&#39;s best known and beloved novels. Tom Sawyer recounts the adventures of a self-confident but na誰ve boy who runs away with his friend, Huckleberry Finn, after witnessing a murder. Along the way, they have many adventures and meet interesting people. Tom&#39;s childish innocence contrasts starkly with the cruelty and hypocrisy that fill the adult world. Frequently lauded as The Great American Novel, The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn follows young Huck Finn and the runaway slave Jim as they raft down the Mississippi River. This commentary on race, religion, and the oppression of societal norms is as spirited and controversial now as it was over a century ago. Finally, in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#39;s, Mark Twain&#39;s comedic satire transports young a New Englander to seventh-century Britain, juxtaposing two supposed utopias-the romantic age of kings and the age of nineteenth-century innovation." />
