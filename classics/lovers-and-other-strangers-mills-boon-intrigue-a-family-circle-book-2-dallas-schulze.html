        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And Shannon Deveraux was starting to feel the sizzle. She was a woman who had never had a place to call home, yet she seemed tempted by Serenity. Maybe it was the charm of the village? Or the friendliness of even the most gossipy neighbors?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Or could it be her drop-dead gorgeous and sexy new neighbor, Reece Morgan? Except Reece was hardly new in town. In fact, he&#39;d lived the first miserable seventeen years of his life here and, really, he was just passing through. Until he got a look at the proverbially beautiful girl next door - and realized that sometimes, there really was no place like home.&lt;/p&gt;
