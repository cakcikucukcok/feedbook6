  <title>The Vegetable, or From President to Postman - F. Scott Fitzgerald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Vegetable, or From President to Postman is a short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald that he developed into a play.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the original publication of The Vegetable, or From President to Postman (1923), F. Scott Fitzgerald included the following quotation on the title page: &amp;ldquo;Any man who doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to get on in the world, to make a million dollars, and maybe even park his toothbrush in the White House, hasn&amp;rsquo;t got as much to him as a good dog has&amp;mdash;he&amp;rsquo;s nothing more or less than a vegetable.&amp;rdquo; Fitzgerald used this quotation, which he claimed came &amp;ldquo;from a current magazine,&amp;rdquo; as a springboard for his only published play. This comic romp satirizes the ambitions of an ordinary man who wants to be President of the United States&amp;mdash;that is, if he cannot make it as a postman.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The play concerns the misadventures of the middle-class striver Jerry Frost. He is a 35-year-old &amp;quot;clerk for the railroad at $35,000 a year. He possesses no eyebrows, but nevertheless he constantly tries to knit them.&amp;quot; His marriage to Charlotte (30) is dull, and he is stereotypically hen-pecked by her (cf. Ralph Cramden, Fred Flintstone, Homer Simpson, et al.). We learn in the first act that Jerry wanted to be a postman, but that he somehow blames his wife for missing out on this ambition...&lt;br /&gt;
