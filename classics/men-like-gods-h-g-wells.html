  <title>Men Like Gods - H.G. Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mr. Barnstaple found himself in urgent need of a holiday, and he had no one to go with and nowhere to go. He was overworked. And he was tired of home. He was a man of strong natural affections; he loved his family extremely so that he knew it by heart, and when he was in these jaded moods it bored him acutely. His three sons, who were all growing up, seemed to get leggier and larger every day; they sat down in the chairs he was just going to sit down in; they played him off his own pianola; they filled the house with hoarse, vast laughter at jokes that one couldn&amp;#39;t demand to be told; they cut in on the elderly harmless flirtations that had hitherto been one of his chief consolations in this vale; they beat him at tennis; they fought playfully on the landings, and fell downstairs by twos and threes with an enormous racket. Their hats were everywhere. They were late for breakfast. They went to bed every night in a storm of uproar: &amp;quot;Haw, Haw, Haw&amp;mdash;bump!&amp;quot; and their mother seemed to like it. They all cost money, with a cheerful disregard of the fact that everything had gone up except Mr. Barnstaple&amp;#39;s earning power. And when he said a few plain truths about Mr. Lloyd George at meal-times, or made the slightest attempt to raise the tone of the table-talk above the level of the silliest persiflage, their attention wandered ostentatiously...&lt;br /&gt;
At any rate it&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;seemed&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;ostentatiously.&lt;br /&gt;
He wanted badly to get away from his family to some place where he could think of its various members with quiet pride and affection, and otherwise not be disturbed by them..." />

Wells</i></b> | Men Like Gods (1923) is a novel, referred to by the author as a "scientific fantasy", by English writer H. G. Wells. It features a utopia located in a parallel universe .<br /><b><i>Men Like Gods - Wikipedia</i></b> | No one would have believed, in those early days of his career, that Wells would settle down to write such tame scientific fantasies as In the Days of the Comet and Men Like Gods. Although Men Like Gods is more readable than his 'straight' utopia, A Modern Utopia (from 1905), the plot is hardly gripping; like The Food of the Gods, it begins fairly promisingly but ends rather drably.<br /><b><i>Men Like Gods: Wells, H G: 9781515439912: Amazon.com: Books</i></b> | H. G. Wells wrote a great many novels, all of them a joy to read. This one is a Science Fiction Utopian novel. In a parallel universe, on a planet much like Earth but 3000 years into our future, a pair of scientists try to rotate one of the other dimensions, one they believe is empty and not very long (maybe a foot or two).<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Men Like Gods - H.G.
