  <title>The Well at the World&#39;s End -  William Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="William Morris is the founder of modern fantasy literature and &amp;quot;The Well at the World&amp;#39;s End&amp;quot; is his masterpiece. It is odd that his works are not more widely read or discussed in the fantasy literature community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The Well at the World&amp;#39;s End&amp;quot; is thought to be one of the first examples of an entirely fictional fantasy world, and has greatly influenced later fantasy writers such as C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien. The book follows the travels of Ralph, a prince of a tiny country, as he disobeys his fathers wishes and runs away from home to adventure in the world, and seek out the fabled Well at World&amp;#39;s End, said to grant eternal youth to those who drink from it." />

It was first published in 1896 and has been reprinted a number of times since, most notably in two parts as the 20th and 21st volumes of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, in August and September 1970.<br /><b><i>The Well at the World's End - Wikipedia</i></b> | I need it was William Morris who first inspired Tolkien in his youth with tales of knights, castles, and fell Men of the East. The Well at the World’s End takes the legend of the Fountain of Youth to a new realm of mystery and enchantment. The story is written in a somewhat archaic prose, and so can at time be difficult to follow.<br /><b><i>William Morris - The Well at the World's End: Morris ...</i></b> | William Morris - The Well at the World's End William Morris. 3.8 out of 5 stars 51.
