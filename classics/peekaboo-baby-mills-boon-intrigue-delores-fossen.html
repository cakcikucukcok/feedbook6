          &lt;strong&gt;Months after the birth of her son, single mom Delaney Nash discovered a horrible truth: the sperm bank she&#39;d used was under investigation for unethical practices.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Complicating matters even further was the very real possibility her son&#39;s father was none other than Ryan McCall - her sworn enemy. Suddenly a string of suspicious - and near-fatal - accidents proved that Delaney and her son were in terrible danger.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And the only man she could trust to help her uncover the truth was the very same man who was strictly off-limits. And now, in a race against time, could Delaney and Ryan combat danger - and their stormy past - before it was too late?&lt;/p&gt;
