  <title>The Road - Jack London</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;I went on &#39;The Road&#39; because I couldn&#39;t keep away from it; because I hadn&#39;t the price of the railroad fare in my jeans; because I was so made that I couldn&#39;t work all my life on &#39;one same shift&#39;; because &amp;#8212; well, just because it was easier to than not to.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;Jack London&#39;s &quot;road&quot; is the railroad, and these reminiscences paint a vivid portrait of life in the United States during the major economic depression of the 1890s. His compelling adventures include a month-long detention in a state penitentiary for vagrancy, as well as his travels with Kelly&#39;s Army, a group of unemployed workers who united to protest the labor environment.&lt;BR&gt;London honed his storytelling skills during his hobo days, spinning yarns to avoid arrest and to cajole food and money from sympathetic listeners. This compelling memoir &amp;#8212; which inspired the 1973 movie &lt;I&gt;Emperor of the North Pole &lt;/I&gt;&amp;#8212; also chronicles London&#39;s inner journey, from self-interested freebooter to social activist.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
