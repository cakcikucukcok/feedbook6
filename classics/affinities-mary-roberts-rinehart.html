      <meta name="description" content="Immerse yourself in the glamor, glitz and turbulence of the period leading up to the 1920s with this satisfying collection of tales from author Mary Roberts Rinehard. Veering from romance to mystery and back again, this diverse volume is the perfect way to while away a pleasant afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mary Roberts Rinehart (August 12, 1876 &amp;ndash; September 22, 1958) was an American writer, often called the American Agatha Christie, although her first mystery novel was published 14 years before Christie&amp;#39;s first novel in 1920.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rinehart is considered the source of the phrase &amp;quot;The butler did it&amp;quot; from her novel The Door (1930), although the novel does not use the exact phrase. Rinehart is also considered to have invented the &amp;quot;Had-I-But-Known&amp;quot; school of mystery writing, with the publication of The Circular Staircase (1908)." />
