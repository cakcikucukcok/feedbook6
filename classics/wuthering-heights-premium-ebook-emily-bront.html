  <title>Wuthering Heights (Premium Ebook) - Emily Brontë</title>
      <meta name="description" content="**** PREMIUM EBOOK WITH BEAUTIFUL LAYOUT ****&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;laquo; In Wuthering Heights the reader is shocked, disgusted, almost sickened by details of cruelty, inhumanity, and the most diabolical hate and vengeance, and anon come passages of powerful testimony to the supreme power of love&amp;mdash;even over demons in the human form. The women in the book are of a strange fiendish-angelic nature, tantalising, and terrible, and the men are indescribable out of the book itself. Yet, towards the close of the story occurs the following pretty, soft picture, which comes like the rainbow after a storm&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;
We strongly recommend all our readers who love novelty to get this story, for we can promise them that they never have read anything like it before. It is very puzzling and very interesting, and if we had space we would willingly devote a little more time to the analysis of this remarkable story, but we must leave it to our readers to decide what sort of book it is. &amp;raquo; Douglas Jerrold&amp;rsquo;s Weekly Newspaper, 15 January 1848.&lt;br /&gt;
