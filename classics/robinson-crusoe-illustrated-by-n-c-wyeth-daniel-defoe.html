  <title>Robinson Crusoe (Illustrated by N. C. Wyeth) - Daniel Defoe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in 1719, Daniel Defoe’s “Robinson Crusoe” is a pioneering work of realist fiction and one of the most popular adventure novels ever written. When it first appeared it was widely believed to be a true account of actual events. While it is thought to have been inspired by the real life story of Alexander Selkirk, a castaway who lived on an island in the Pacific for four years, the story is in fact completely fictional. At the beginning of the novel we find Robinson Crusoe desiring a life at sea, despite the wishes of his parents for him to pursue a more sensible career. Despite numerous disasters and misadventures at sea he is not to be deterred from his life choice. Ultimately he finds himself stranded on a deserted island when his ship is destroyed in a storm. Having only his wits and faith to help him survive, he makes do with the supplies that he has salvaged from the wreckage and the resources he finds on the island. Despite its relatively simple plot, “Robinson Crusoe” remains to this day as an enduring tale of maritime life. This edition is illustrated by N. C. Wyeth." />
