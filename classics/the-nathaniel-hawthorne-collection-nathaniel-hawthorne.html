  <title>The Nathaniel Hawthorne Collection - Nathaniel Hawthorne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nathaniel Hawthorne was an American novelist,&amp;nbsp;dark romantic, and short story writer.&lt;br /&gt;
He was born in 1804 in&amp;nbsp;Salem, Massachusetts, to Nathaniel Hathorne and the former Elizabeth Clarke Manning. His ancestors include&amp;nbsp;John Hathorne, the only judge involved in the&amp;nbsp;Salem witch trials&amp;nbsp;who never repented of his actions. He entered&amp;nbsp;Bowdoin College&amp;nbsp;in 1821, was elected to&amp;nbsp;Phi Beta Kappa&amp;nbsp;in 1824, and graduated in 1825. He published his first work in 1828, the novel&amp;nbsp;Fanshawe; he later tried to suppress it, feeling that it was not equal to the standard of his later work. He published several short stories in periodicals, which he collected in 1837 as&amp;nbsp;Twice-Told Tales. The next year, he became engaged to&amp;nbsp;Sophia Peabody. He worked at the&amp;nbsp;Boston Custom House&amp;nbsp;and joined&amp;nbsp;Brook Farm, a&amp;nbsp;transcendentalist&amp;nbsp;community, before marrying Peabody in 1842. The couple moved to&amp;nbsp;The Old Manse&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;Concord, Massachusetts, later moving to Salem,&amp;nbsp;the Berkshires, then to&amp;nbsp;The Wayside&amp;nbsp;in Concord.&amp;nbsp;The Scarlet Letter&amp;nbsp;was published in 1850, followed by a succession of other novels. A political appointment as consul took Hawthorne and family to Europe before their return to Concord in 1860. Hawthorne died on May 19, 1864, and was survived by his wife and their three children.&lt;br /&gt;
