  <title>High-Stakes Bride (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) - Fiona Brand</title>

        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;THE ONLY MAN WHO COULD SAVE HER…&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Special Forces agent Carter Rawlings was back — and Dani Marlow&#39;s world was spinning in his wake. The local arson attacks for which she was being blamed were only part of the problem. The feelings Carter&#39;s reappearance had ignited threatened far more dangerous territory — a past she tried to keep hidden, especially from him.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the trouble on her land and Carter&#39;s tantalizing presence, Dani had to think about her future. Did she want to keep avoiding the truth — that she loved Carter and wanted to make a life with him — or could she finally face the stakes head-on, deal with her enemies and seal her heart to that of the only man she&#39;s ever loved?&lt;/p&gt;
