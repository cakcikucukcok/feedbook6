  <title>The Story of King Arthur and His Knights (Illustrated) - Howard Pyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in 1903, “The Story of King Arthur and His Knights” is Howard Pyle’s brilliantly illustrated book which chronicles some of the major episodes of the legend of King Arthur. The tales of England’s mythological first king are told over a series of two books in this volume. In the first book, “The Book of King Arthur”, Pyle relates how a young King Arthur wins the throne by pulling the sword from the stone, wins the magical sword Excalibur by following the instructions of the Lady of the Lake, and wins the heart of Lady Guinevere. In the second book, “The Book of Three Worthies”, the stories of Merlin, Sir Pellias, and Sir Gawaine are told. Widely regarded as one of the greatest illustrators of the 20th century, Howard Pyle’s beautiful artwork is on full display in this classic retelling of Arthurian Legend. This edition includes all of the illustrations included in the original edition and a biographical afterword." />
