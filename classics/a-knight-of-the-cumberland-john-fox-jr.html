  <title>A Knight of the Cumberland - John Fox, Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Populated by a parade of fascinating characters, this slice-of-life story provides a glimpse into life in the Appalachian region in the early twentieth century. A prodigal son, the offspring of a legendary local moonshiner, makes his yearly pilgrimage home to the wilds of Virginia, where he kicks off the vestiges of his comparatively sophisticated existence in the city and immerses himself in the local customs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
John Fox Jr. (December 16, 1862 &amp;ndash; July 8, 1919) was an American journalist, novelist, and short story writer. Though he occasionally wrote for periodicals, after 1904, Fox dedicated much of his attention to fiction. The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come (published in 1903) and The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (published in 1908) are arguably his most well known and successful works, entering the New York Times top ten list of bestselling novels for 1903, 1904, 1908, and 1909 respectively. In The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, the character Devil Judd Tolliver was based on the real life of &amp;quot;Devil John&amp;quot; Wesley Wright, the sheriff of Wise County, Virginia.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many of his works reflected the naturalist style, his childhood in Kentucky&amp;#39;s Bluegrass region, and his life among the coal miners of Big Stone Gap, Virginia. Many of his novels were historical romances or period dramas set in that region. John Fox Jr. died in 1919 of pneumonia in Big Stone Gap, Virginia, and was buried in the family plot in Paris, Kentucky. His marriage to Austrian opera singer Fritzi Scheff in 1908 lasted just over four years. He had no children. The John Fox Jr. House in Big Stone Gap was turned into a museum after the death of John&amp;#39;s sister in 1970. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974." />
