  <title>What to Draw and How to Draw It - Edwin George Lutz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This ebook is the first edition of &quot;What to Draw and How to Draw It&quot; that contains a detailed index of the maravillious drawings of the Author. Edwin George Lutz published this book in 1913 with Dodd, Mead and Company publishers. This is really a remarkable book in wich line is made a good reason from form. The youngest child may grasp the magic progress of this way of working and he will draw the picture naturally and well. Instructions are very brief, for the key lines of each object tell their own story and the child is entranced by the results soon gained. There is no stupid tracing in this book, for tracing accomplishes at most only a little muscular control. The book provides a step-by-step system and fixes the object in memory and develops naturally a physical skill and a memorized knowledge of proportion and form. Foreshortening and perspective, that bugbears to young artists, are overcome by the simplest progressive examples. Remembering the key line offers the way to the completed object. There are hundreds of pictures to draw and all are those most fascinating to the child, who is thrilled by the “magic” that makes drawing easy and delightfully interesting. “Just remember the key line, that&#39;s all”." />
