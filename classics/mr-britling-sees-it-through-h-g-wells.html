  <title>Mr. Britling Sees It Through - H. G. Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mr Britling lives in the quintessentially English town of Matching&amp;rsquo;s Easy in Essex. He is a great thinker, an essayist, but most of all an optimist. When war arrives he is forced to reassess many of the things he had been so sure of. The war brings great change - Belgian refugees come with dreadful stories and everywhere it seems there are young men dressed in khaki. The family&amp;rsquo;s young German tutor is forced to head back to Germany, and Mr Britling&amp;rsquo;s seventeen year old son enlists in the Territorials. Day by day and month by month, Wells chronicles the unfolding events and public reaction as witnessed by the inhabitants of one house in rural Essex. Each of the characters tries in a different way to keep their bearings in a world suddenly changed beyond recognition. Tragedy ensues, Mr Britling must wrestle with outrage, grief and attempts at rationalisation as he &amp;lsquo;sees it through&amp;rsquo;." />
