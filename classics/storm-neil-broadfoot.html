  <title>Storm - Neil Broadfoot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;The real deal&quot;--Crimesquad. After his editor is murdered in front of him, crime reporter Doug McGregor&#39;s world falls apart. As prime witness, he&#39;s not allowed to investigate the case, and he&#39;s left only with questions and a bloody memory seared in his mind. On top of that, Doug&#39;s &#39;friendship&#39; with his police contact, DS Susie Drummond, is in a weird place right now. So he leaps at the chance to take some time out with an old friend on the Isle of Skye. But when another savage killing occurs, Doug realises that the murders may be linked, and that going to Skye was the best and worst move possible. He&#39;s in the eye of the Storm - and this one could engulf them all." />
