  <title>Ambushed! (Mills &amp; Boon Intrigue) (McCalls&#39; Montana, Book 3) - B.J. Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;COWBOY SHERIFF IN COMMAND&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite his previously unblemished reputation, for years, cowboy sheriff Cash McCall had been the prime suspect in his fiancée&#39;s disappearance and presumed murder. So when a woman claiming to be her showed up in his office, Cash was finally off the hook…even though his instincts told him he&#39;d never before held this woman in his arms.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Posing as a missing woman had seemed like a good idea to on-the-run Molly Kilpatrick…unfortunately, she&#39;d made the mistake of stealing the wrong identity. Someone wanted the woman dead and would stop at nothing to make sure, this time, she stayed dead. Molly needed Cash&#39;s protection and had to trust in his innocence, but if she was wrong, she&#39;d be &lt;em&gt;dead&lt;/em&gt; wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
