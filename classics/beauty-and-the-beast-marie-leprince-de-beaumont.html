  <title>Beauty and the Beast - Marie Leprince de Beaumont</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Beauty and the Beast is a traditional fairy tale written by Marie Leprince de Beaumont. It was influenced by some earlier stories, such as Cupid and Psyche, written by Lucius Apuleius Madaurensi in The Golden Ass in the 2nd century AD, and The Pig King, an Italian fairytale published by Giovanni Francesco Straparola in The Facetious Nights of Straparola.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Variants of the tale are known across Europe. In France, for example, Z&amp;eacute;mire and Azor is an operatic version of the story, written by Marmontel and composed by Gr&amp;eacute;try in 1771, which had enormous success well into the 19th century; it is based on the second version of the tale. Amour pour amour (Love for love), by Nivelle de la Chauss&amp;eacute;e, is a 1742 play based on Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve&amp;#39;s version. According to researchers at universities in Durham and Lisbon, the story originated around 4,000 years ago." />
