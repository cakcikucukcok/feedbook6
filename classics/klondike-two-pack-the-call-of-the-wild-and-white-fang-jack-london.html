  <title>Klondike Two Pack - The Call of the Wild and White Fang - Jack London</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jack London spent a year living in the Yukon and drew heavily upon his experiences there while writing his two classics, &lt;i&gt;The Call of the Wild &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; White Fang&lt;/i&gt;. He later said, &amp;quot;It was in the Klondike that I found myself.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The Call of the Wild &lt;/i&gt;is one of London&amp;#39;s most popular novels. The story follows a dog named Buck, a 140lb Saint Bernard and Scotch Shepard mix. Buck is abducted from a comfortable life as a pet and tossed into the chaos of the Klondike Gold Rush and the brutal realities of frontier life. Buck changes hands a number of times before landing in the kindly hands of John Thornton. Thornton takes ownership of Buck from a trio of ignorant stampeders, intent upon making a dangerous river crossing. Buck refuses to cross, despite a vicious beating. Thornton recognizes the dogs intelligence and strength. He steps in to claim the dog and nurses Buck back to health. But Buck is forever changed by the treatment he has received at the hands of other men.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A companion novel to &lt;i&gt;The Call of the Wild, White Fang&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a wild dog&amp;#39;s journey toward becoming civilized. The much loved book is characteristic of London&amp;#39;s precise prose style and innovation use of voice and perspective. Much of the novel is written from the viewpoint of the animals, allowing London to explore how animals view their world and how they view humans. White Fang relies on his instincts as well as his strength and courage to survive in the Yukon wilderness&amp;mdash;despite both animal and human predators&amp;mdash;and eventually comes to make his peace with man.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both editions includes illustrations and links to free full-length audio recordings of &lt;i&gt;The Call of the Wild&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;i&gt; White Fang&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
