  <title>The Complete Works of Rudyard Kipling: All novels, short stories, letters and poems - Rudyard Kipling, GP Editors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Complete Works of Rudyard Kipling&lt;/strong&gt; is a truly complete and authoritative single-volume edition of Kipling&amp;rsquo;s works. It contains his all novels, as well as his plays, stories, poems, essays and letters, all in their most authoritative texts. For easier navigation, there are tables of contents for each section and one for the whole volume.&lt;br /&gt; With this beautiful Collectible Edition, you can enjoy Kipling&amp;#39;s enduring literary legacy again and again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936) was born in Bombay, but educated in England at the United Services College, Westward Ho, Bideford. In 1882 he returned to India, where he worked for Anglo-Indian newspapers.&lt;br /&gt; His literary career began with Departmental Ditties (1886), but subsequently he became chiefly known as a writer of short stories. A prolific writer, he achieved fame quickly. Kipling was the poet of the British Empire and its yeoman, the common soldier, whom he glorified in many of his works, in particular Plain Tales from the Hills (1888) and Soldiers Three (1888), collections of short stories with roughly and affectionately drawn soldier portraits. His Barrack Room Ballads (1892) were written for, as much as about, the common soldier. In 1894 appeared his Jungle Book, which became a children&amp;rsquo;s classic all over the world. Kim (1901), the story of Kimball O&amp;rsquo;Hara and his adventures in the Himalayas, is perhaps his most felicitous work. Other works include The Second Jungle Book (1895), The Seven Seas (1896), Captains Courageous (1897), The Day&amp;rsquo;s Work (1898), Stalky and Co. (1899), Just So Stories (1902), Trafficks and Discoveries (1904), Puck of Pook&amp;rsquo;s Hill (1906), Actions and Reactions (1909), Debits and Credits (1926), Thy Servant a Dog (1930), and Limits and Renewals (1932). During the First World War Kipling wrote some propaganda books. His collected poems appeared in 1933.&lt;br /&gt; Kipling was the recipient of many honorary degrees and other awards. In 1926 he received the Gold Medal of the Royal Society of Literature, which only Scott, Meredith, and Hardy had been awarded before him.&lt;br /&gt; Rudyard Kipling died on January 18, 1936.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This collection features the following works:&lt;br /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Novels&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; 1. Captains Courageous&lt;br /&gt; 2. Kim&lt;br /&gt; 3. The Light that Failed&lt;br /&gt; 4.
