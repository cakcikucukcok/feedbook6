  <title>At the Mountains of Madness - H.P. Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the Mountains of Madness is a novella by horror writer H. P. Lovecraft.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story details the events of a disastrous expedition to the Antarctic continent in September 1930, and what was found there by a group of explorers led by the narrator, Dr. William Dyer of Miskatonic University. Throughout the story, Dyer details a series of previously untold events in the hope of deterring another group of explorers who wish to return to the continent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The novella&amp;#39;s title is derived from a line in &amp;quot;The Hashish Man,&amp;quot; a short story by fantasy writer Edward Plunkett, Lord Dunsany: &amp;quot;And we came at last to those ivory hills that are named the Mountains of Madness...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story has inadvertently popularized the concept of ancient astronauts, as well as Antarctica&amp;#39;s place in the &amp;quot;ancient astronaut mythology&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story is told in a first-person perspective by the geologist William Dyer, a professor at Miskatonic University, in the hope to prevent an important and much publicized scientific expedition to Antarctica. Throughout the course of his explanation, Dyer relates how he led a group of scholars from Arkham&amp;#39;s Miskatonic University on a previous expedition to Antarctica, during which they discovered ancient ruins and a dangerous secret, beyond a range of mountains higher than the Himalayas." />
