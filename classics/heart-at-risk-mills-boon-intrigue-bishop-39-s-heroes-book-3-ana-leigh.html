          &lt;strong&gt;Ex-SEAL Kurt Bolen was planning only a quick visit to his hometown until gorgeous Maddie Bennett, a blast from his past, hit him with shocking news.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Maddie had worshipped Kurt since high school. She had no regrets about their one night together because it left her with a precious gift–their son. And yet, she had no doubt Kurt would leave her again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As father and son started to bond, they were all threatened by an unexpected danger–someone thought they knew too much. Though uncertain about their future, would Maddie realize just how far Kurt would go to protect those he loved…?&lt;/p&gt;
