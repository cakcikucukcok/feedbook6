  <title>Developmental Harmonization: - Dr. Raymon McAdaragh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Developmental Harmonization is a process that a group, or an individual, may follow to achieve a state of Psychic Harmonization (a state of physical, psychological and spiritual harmony). This type of state is described in various terminologies by many philosophers in the fields of meditation, metapsychology and psychology from Socrates, to Rudolph Steiner, to Sri Aurobindo. In this state, an individual may discover his or her intended path and purpose in life. Practicing the exercises associated with the Developmental Harmonization process also provides the many health-related benefits associated with meditation and physical exercise. The exercises described are meditative techniques that have been practiced in many cultures for ages. They are presented here in a process that utilizes the principles of Instructional Systems Design, in order to take advantage of their differential benefits. This is something virtually missing in other books on meditation. Steps toward the attainment of higher awareness are also described. The techniques are presented in an easily-understandable, practical application that may be used by anyone interested in the harmonization of our human condition." />
