  <title>The Triumph of Grace: Literary and Theological Studies in Deuteronomy and Deuteronomic Themes - Daniel I. Block</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Apostle Paul&#39;s negative statements about the law have deafened the ears of many to the grace that Moses proclaims in Deuteronomy. Most Christians have a dim view of this book, which they consider to be primarily a book of laws. However, when we read or hear it read orally without prejudice, we discover that rather than casting Moses as a legislator, he appears as Israel&#39;s first pastor, whose congregation has gathered before him to hear him preach his final sermons. Accordingly, Deuteronomy represents prophetic preaching at its finest, as Moses seeks to inspire the people of God to a life of faith and godliness in response to God&#39;s repeated demonstrations of grace. Deuteronomy is a dead book for many, because we have not recognized this gospel; we have heard only law. The essays in this collection arise from a larger project driven by a passion to recover for Christians the life-giving message of the Hebrew Scriptures in general, and to open their ears to God&#39;s amazing grace in Deuteronomy in particular. The wide-ranging &quot;meditations&quot; in this volume do not all focus equally on the topic of God&#39;s grace, but this theme undergirds them all." />
