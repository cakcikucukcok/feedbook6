  <title>Faith That Always Wins - Fatai Kasali</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Faith has been described as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Hebrews 11:1). That is, faith is the foundation on which all our hopes and convictions for the future are built. The confidence that our unseen expectations shall be established is based on faith. This implies that the number of God&amp;rsquo;s blessings a believer will be able to access in his or her lifetime depends on faith. Therefore, it is not surprising that the word &amp;lsquo;faith&amp;rsquo; appears in several places in the Bible as a sign of its importance in the life of a believer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book explores the dynamism of faith and how it can be applied to various issues of life. You will learn in this book; how you can grow your faith to a level in which you become undefeatable in life. It is revealed in this book that faith has different stages of development, and this explains why some believers pass through life with failure and defeat. Every believer has a certain amount of faith at the beginning of their journey as a Christian. This was given in order to kick-start their journey, but it is not the end &amp;ndash; it is the beginning. As you feed your spirit with the Word of God and grow in your knowledge of God, your faith level will grow. As you grow in faith, you will be able to trust God for greater miracles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, this book will teach you how to make your faith work for you as you face different situations of life. You will learn different strategies, as revealed in the Bible, of applying faith to deal with your confrontations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You will discover, through this book, the attributes of faith. This will enable you to check whether you are genuinely operating in faith or not. Faith has attributes, and wherever it is in operation these are clearly revealed. It is one thing to say you are acting in faith; it is another thing to actually be acting in faith in a biblical way. Faith has its own nature, and if this is absent in any circumstances, such a believer is not acting in faith.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is my hope that by the time you finish reading this book, your faith will have significantly grown.&lt;/p&gt;" />
