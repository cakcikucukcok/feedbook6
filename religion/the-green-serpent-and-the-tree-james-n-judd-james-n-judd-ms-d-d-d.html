  <title>The Green Serpent and the Tree - James N. Judd, James N. Judd  Ms. D D.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Within the human system there are certain archetypes, centers, or vortexes of energy. As this energy or power exists at a different level than our conscious awareness it remains essentially dormant with most people, but when activated usually through meditation this force has a most profound influence upon our psychological, spiritual and physical nature.&lt;P&gt;As this inner, subtle energy plays such a vital role in our overall being there is much to be gained from understanding this force, and how to benefit from its power. This information can be found in the ancient spiritual teachings of the Jewish Kabbala and the Hindu Kundalini Yoga, but the complexity of these teachings, particularly with Kabbala, makes it difficult to find useful answers as to how this inner power can be utilized.&lt;P&gt;In The Green Serpent and the Tree, Dr. Judd cuts through the confusing terminology of these teachings and, in an easy-to-read style using practical examples and illustrations, logically explains:The inner nature of man and structure of the soul.How Kabbala and Kundalini Yoga can be reconciled, and how they augment each other.The difference between the symbols of The Tree of Life, and The Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil.Why the seven inner centers (Chakras) of Kundalini Yoga are the same as the ten centers (Sefirot) of Kabbala.The significance of the Green Serpent (Kundalini) and the functions of the various channels that connect the inner centers.The different centers, with a detailed description of their psychological and spiritual influence.Relationship of meditation with releasing the power from the inner centers.The practical value of meditation, its four stages, and the physical, psychological, psychic and spiritual effects.The risks involved in releasing these inner powers, and how to avoid them. The reason for the inter-relationship between Kabbala and Kundalini Yoga, and their original source.&lt;P&gt;Although this book is written in an explanatory style which guides the layman through the intricacies of these two teachings as they relate to our inner powers, the material content contains much that will interest the more advanced student. Based upon thorough research, Dr. Judd outlines in logical steps why,The Tree symbol that is frequently referred to as the Tree of Life is misnamed.Any attempt to reconcile the Chakras with the Sefirot using the wrong Tree symbol will lead to inaccurate conclusions.The position of the Sefirot changes depending upon which Tree symbol is used. &lt;P&gt;There are three central channels that connect the Chakras, rather than the one that is usually shown, and Kabbala supports this fact.This explains the different levels of power released from the same Chakra.Why some of the practices used to open the Chakras involve considerable risks&lt;P&gt;Anyone who wishes to expand their knowledge of Kabbala, Kundalini Yoga, the inner nature and powers of man, meditation, and the safe way to travel on the journey within, will greatly benefit from the information in this book.&lt;/P&gt;" />
