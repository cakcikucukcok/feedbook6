  <title>Katrina and the Need for Revival in the American Church - Jerry Bass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What is it going to take to revive the American church and usher in a spiritual awakening in the country? The author was trapped in a downtown hospital in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. From that experience, Jerry Bass believes that God allowed this disaster in order to wake up the church from its spiritual lethargy. This book was written with an overwhelming conviction that revival in the American church is needed.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Endorsements
&quot;Reading Jerry&#39;s book brought about different emotions in me. My first emotion was painful memories of a very difficult time in my life living in a city that was destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. My second emotion was one of hope as Jerry called for revival in our city, state, and nation. Ladies and gentlemen WE NEED REVIVAL in America, and it MUST start in our churches!&quot;
Fred Luter, Jr., pastor, Franklin Avenue Baptist Church, New Orleans, Louisiana, president, Southern Baptist Convention&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ive never seen the need for revival in the Church like I see it now. I pray for revival every day. I did not pray for revival before I read this book nor understand the difference between a revival and evangelization. I have also realized that 2 Chronicles 7:14 is directed to Gods people (that includes me!) and not to unbelievers. I believe that many American Christians will be touched by Gods Spirit as they read this book and glean from it that revival must start first with them.
