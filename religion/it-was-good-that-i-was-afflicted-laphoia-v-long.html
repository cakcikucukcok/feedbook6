She expresses to the reader, that we all have an appointment with destiny.  She believes every person birthed in the earth has a purpose in life, ordained by God. Her belief is that the reader will find hope, encouragement and words of inspiration, as she walks them through her own personal journey as a Christian. She reveals to the reader that trials, test, and tribulation is to identify each child of God as partaking of the sufferings, of Christ.  She explains that through the eyes of God, He gets the ultimate Glory, just as He did with His Son Jesus.  Her concept of writing this book is symbolic to traveling on a road to reach the destination of &quot;The Promise Land&quot;, with only to find many obstacles, and oppositions that attempts to hinder us from moving further in life. She encourages the reader to look ahead, keep the focus, and diligently seek the face of Almighty God when faced with challenges.  She brings forth the word with, strength and power, in hopes to impart the truth in the heart, mind and soul of the believer.  She believes that through the teaching and guidance of God&#39;s word, the believer will understand, the reality of their redemption, enabling them to walk in their divine call.  Her voice resounds to the world, by compassionately letting them know that Jesus is the way, truth and Life.  It is her utmost desire for see people gravitate to the divine will of God, and to receive Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior.  She leaves the believer with this final note:  &quot;That their Greatest Afflictions will bring forth the Greatest Blessings&quot;.  Come and Journey with her, to a road that leads to The Promises of God." />
