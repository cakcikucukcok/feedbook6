  <title>If You Don’T Like Uniforms, You Need to Know Why! - Apostle Keith B. Urquhart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you dont like uniforms, you need to know why is a book written to reveal the enemy of the unity, and divine purpose of God.
In this book you will discover situations that people from the bible encountered, which had a major impact on their lives. Many of wicked operated from a force working behind their decisions and actions that was inspired by Satan.
You will see rebellion as a attribute of the evil one.
The scripture says, all rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft. Any path that I chose that leads me from my Creator places me in opposition with the one
I was formed to please.
Our uniform is our body that enables us to exist on this planet. Our spirit is Gods signature for our life and our soul links our allegiance to our God.
This book will help you determine that you were formed to please God and that you have a mandate from the Father to express him universally.
The world is attracted to the anointing placed upon
Gods people and awaits the progression of the sons and daughters of God to launch his attack. Satans ultimate goal is to hinder Gods plan for this plan-net earth.
The Gospel according to the Book of Daniel chapter 1:1 reveals the on-going strategy of Satan. The enemy set his target against the people of God. The king of Babel or confusion was sent to Gods praise center to silence their worship. The Gospel of Daniel Chapter 1 will be discussed in more detail in latter chapters.
The Psalmist recognized the benefit of our covenant. O
Lord, by your hand save me from such men, from men of this world whose reward is in this life. You still the hunger of those you cherish: their sons have plenty, and they store up wealth for their children. (Psalms 17:14).
Jehovah Jireh is our provider." />
