  <title>African Humanity - Revd. Dr. Robinson A. Milwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My thesis is basically intended for theological and philosophical students and at the same-time their lecturers in biblical theology, systematic theology and philosophy of religion. There is no doubt in my mind that these disciplines must surgically forcefully put through the hermeneutical operation of radicalism and liberation black theology and black studies. Because liberation black theology and black studies are both pertinent and existential to black people not only in the diaspora but principally within the demography of Africa. Why? Because Africa is the social, economic, political, scientific, spiritual, theological and psychological incubation chamber with the legacies of the transatlantic slave trade, colonialism and semantic cultural Christianization of Africans. The besom merchants, traders, planters, slavers, missionaries, philosophers, historians, theologians and scientists, with savagery and brutality imposed on African slaves mendaciously that enslavement was good for Africans. It is therefore apposite for liberation black theology and black studies particularly in praxis to critique and challenge the systems and endogenous forces that violated and emasculated Africans empowerment and humanity. The slaves were brutally transformed physically and psychologically. The slaves potentialities endowed with the imprint of the African traditional belief in a supreme being and prime mover of the cosmos was transgressed with falsehood that their belief in a supreme being was primitive and paganistic. For Africans the supreme being is within their inner consciousness. The enslavement of Africans was without morality and justice.
