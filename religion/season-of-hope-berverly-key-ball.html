  <title>Season of Hope - Berverly Key Ball</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God has promised to never leave us or forsake us (Heb. 13:5), yet for the newly widowed, feeling all alone is a new challenge. In multivoice viewpoint, read Jim and Beverlys stories individually and collectively, as they share with the reader the history and the events of their unlikely meeting. 
A Season of Hope: Her Story, His Story, Their Story is a journey into their lives, different and unique, as they discover their season of hope again at ages sixty-two and fifty-five. Bathed in their amazement of Gods working in their lives, you will find yourself identifying your own season of hope! 
The Balls use their seventy-one years of collective marriage experience to urge the reader to become aware of the ordinary and extraordinary circumstances in their own personal stories. The book is a combined effort of two people who loved the Lord and each other. Jim went to be with the Lord on November 26, 2004, and Beverly wrote the book using both their writings, collected and filed but never before published in book form. Watch the Lord set into motion events that will leave you cheering with them and forever replacing the word lucky with blessed!" />
