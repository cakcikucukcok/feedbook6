  <title>Living in God&#39;s Rest - Nancy LaPointe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Our current culture is producing anxiety-ridden and stressed-out people. The busyness of our lives, as well as certain strongholds and thinking patterns, can prevent us from connecting with God and finding His peace. Living in Gods Rest is a guide to letting go of the tensions and worries that chain us down and relaxing in His love and redemption. When we know how to enter into that divine place of rest, we can find ourselves at peace, no matter what is happening all around us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you, Nancy, for this powerful book. God will use this to lift the heavy yokes of stress, fear, and anxiety off of peoples hearts and find rest in Him. Living in Gods Rest is an amazing book.&lt;br /&gt;Dale Walker, author, Kissing the Face of God and pastor, &lt;br /&gt;Heart for the World Church and Ministries&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in Gods Rest is a practical guide to learning to relax into Gods loving arms. Nancy LaPointes personal story combined with usable information brings letting go and letting God so much closer. This book is indeed a blessing for us all. &lt;br /&gt;Sandi Browne, author, &lt;br /&gt;Touch the Sky  the Story of a Mom, a Wife, an Airshow Pilot and Wingrider&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in Gods Rest is a powerful book about biblical rest, a book that all of us involved in caring for a broken world need to read. Not so that we will stop working, God forbid; on the contrary, as we rest in Him, we become all the more productive at advancing the Kingdom of God on this earth. Nancy offers an enormous gift of encouragement to those of us spending ourselves on behalf of the hungry and I treasure her words of wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;Vicki Penwell, author, Down Mercy Road and founder of Mercy In Action-Philippines&lt;/p&gt;" />
