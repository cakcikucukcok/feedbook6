  <title>&quot;The Word&quot; .... - Matthew Scott Senge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book was created with the intent to grab and wake you from the message of the modern-day church that preaches God has a wonderful plan for your life or a lifestyle-enhancement Gospel. Imagine hearing these words from our Holy Creator on Judgment Day: Depart from me you who practice lawlessness, I never knew you. What would you do if that happened? Moreover, are you willing to take that chance? Examine yourself right now. Do you consider yourself a good person, really? Romans 3:10 (NKJV) states, There is none righteous, no, not one. Take a closer look at the beliefs you may have been taught throughout your life. I am eternally thankful to our Lord and Savior for His patience with me, the undeserved love and kindness He has, as well as His unending grace and mercy He offers to His children. A special thanks goes out to LivingWaters (Ray Comfort and staff ), Bridge - Logos foundation for their help and my family for never giving up on me." />
