  <title>A Spiritually Fit You - Catherine Braswell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="INTRODUCTION
We have been focusing on and dealing with spiritual illnesses
and issues that can sometimes hinder the progress of our walk with
the Lord. These illnesses have been compared to the sicknesses
that affect the natural body, which causes so many breakdowns,
until the body is unable to perform at the maximum level.
Now let us see the benefits of a spiritually fit you and what
can really happen to an individual when the spirit man is up and
running at the maximum level in all areas. What happens when
my mind is 100 percent pure, my heart is free of clots and clutter,
my mouth and tongue are in control, my eyes are at 20/20 visual
acuity, and the rest of my spiritual health is where the Lord needs
me to be operating?
What things will I be able to perform and what changes will
happen in the body of Christ when I am focusing, obeying, walking,
speaking, and loving with a spiritually fit me? If I am spiritually
fit and walking totally in the authority of the Holy Spirit with the
anointing of the Lords approval in my life, a positive change has
to happen to the body of Christ.
You see, spiritual fitness is a must if the church is to move and
shift toward being ready for the Great Return of the Lord. Are we,
the church, spiritually fit and ready for that great day? We can be!
Can I pull off the old me and put on the new me operating in the
call and the charge that our Lord and Savior has given his life for
my expected end? Can I actively rise up and walk in the new birth
that has been freely given to me? Yes, I can" />
