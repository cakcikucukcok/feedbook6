  <title>The Prayer Experiment: Prayer Principles from The Sermon on the Mount - Margaret Therkelsen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you without an answer to an important prayer? Do you pray until you feel you cannot pray anymore? Do you feel discouraged because you have tried to measure up to God&#39;s expectations and still nothing has changed? Do you want to be free from the hindrances that prevent God from answering your prayers?  	The Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7) purely articulates teaching about God&#39;s role and our role in bringing about changes to our lives through prayer. Therkelsen emphasizes five deadly barriers to receiving God&#39;s transformation: 1) judgment and criticism, 2) lovelessness, 3) unforgiveness, 4) anger, and 5) desire for control.  	Remembering her mother&#39;s &quot;prayer experiments&quot; and drawing on her own prayer life, Therkelsen shares what the Holy Spirit has shown her about partnership with God and about processing God&#39;s answer through prayer." />
