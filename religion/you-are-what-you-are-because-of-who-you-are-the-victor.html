  <title>You Are What You Are; Because of Who You Are - The Victor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Seven salient points I want you to know and write in the marble of your heart:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing just happens. Anything good or bad happening to you is for a purpose; you were born in riches or a rag for a purpose. If you can identify with that purpose, you will surely make your dreams a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not what the enemy is doing to you that is killing you; not the society you are in; not the promises some politicians, relatives and associates fail to keep; not the family and community you came from; it is what you have failed to do with yourself that is killing you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life failure is not the absence of opportunities but the absence of vision. You will create whatever opportunities you want in life when you have a vision; that is why you shouldnt fight your way to be in the presence of great men; rather identify your gift, and when you do, it will make a way for you and bring you before great men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If God can trust you, He will increase your capacity to receive more from him. And one of the reasons you are in the struggle and things dont seem to be working to your favor is because you have not earned Gods trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A man with a vision struggles less than a man without a vision to pursue; goals to attain and targets to achieve. Conceive your vision today and pursue it diligently, because if you dont, other people will hire you to pursue theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God never created anybody useless; if He knows you are useless, why would He spend his resources to create you? Your limitation is not entirely your situation, but your understanding of who you are. Biology is studied based on its definition; same applies to life. Your life is what you define it to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would have been better if you were aborted at conception than to live through life not achieving your purpose. Whom should I cry for, the fellow who died untimely or the fellow that is alive and without a purpose?&lt;/p&gt;" />
