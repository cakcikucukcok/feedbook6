  <title>Minority Reports: Voicing Neglected Biblical Texts - Mark Klitsie, Bill Baltz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The stuff that comes after modernism isn&#39;t all bad. Postmodernism, not needing everything to be buttoned up, can leave things dangling; it can pay attention to the obscure, marginal, and particular. The postmodern dynamic invites one to revisit biblical texts that do not fit into tidy, cherished theological constructs: I call these texts the &quot;minority reports.&quot; Popular theology infers that God is just pretending when he changes his mind or gets frustrated, saddened, and affected by humans--this understanding is guided by concepts of God&#39;s omni-attributes. But these wise and well-intentioned concepts fail to portray a God who will not be domesticated. Certain biblical narratives trace YHWH&#39;s hiddenness, suffering, changeability, and &quot;hostility&quot;--this awkward &quot;shadow side&quot; of YHWH is sometimes selectively overlooked. The fear of God is gone. Instead we have the ever-tolerant, universal God who is in danger of evaporating into &quot;spirit,&quot; &quot;light,&quot; and &quot;love.&quot; As a theologian I use Hebrew block logic: competing truths in the Bible are kept intact; synthesis isn&#39;t necessarily sought. God chooses us and we choose God; God is self-sufficient, all-powerful, and all-knowing, needing no creature. Yet he chooses to limit his &quot;omni-ness&quot; in the human arena and makes himself vulnerable to humans. He hyphenates his name with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob--and the church--at a risk." />
