  <title>Faith That Dominated Baghdad - Pastor Jeffery Mathews</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P class=MsoNormal style=&quot;MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt&quot;&gt;Faith That Dominated Baghdad is true story of an American soldier, Chief Warrant Officer and Pastor who would not allow the circumstances of war dictate who God has called him to be. This book is about understanding the power of faith and that if you learn to live by faith that you can dominate every storm in your life no matter the size of the giant. The bloody war of &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags&quot; /&gt;&lt;st1:City w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Baghdad&lt;/st1:City&gt; &lt;st1:country-region w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;st1:place w:st=&quot;on&quot;&gt;Iraq&lt;/st1:place&gt;&lt;/st1:country-region&gt; was a huge giant that stood before my purpose and would bring major storms my way to cut off my destiny to cause me to give in and quit.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;In this book you will find out how faith when it is in its upright position can tear downs walls of intimidation, fear, &lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;and hardship and guide you to the direction that you desire to go when you walk in faith and say only what the word of God says. I discovered by living by faith while major attacks are going on in your life and&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;even at war how you can through the words out of your mouth bring you the results that can only come when you believe what you say to come to pass. There are many that hear the gospel preached on Sunday mornings that are not getting the results that they deserve being a child of the most high God and consider themselves a Christian. What we will discover as I witnessed while serving my country and &lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;preaching the gospel with power at Baghdad Iraq bringing souls to Christ under heavy fire attacks,&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;that the gospel can not profit you when it is not mixed with faith. Witness the power of faith as it shuts down an enemy rocket that lands in my sleeping quarters but falls short because faith was in the house.&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/P&gt;" />
