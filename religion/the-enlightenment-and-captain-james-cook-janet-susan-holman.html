  <title>The Enlightenment and Captain James Cook - Janet Susan Holman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;May all beings enjoy &#39;The Enlightenment.&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Enlightenment and Captain James Cook, The Lono-Cook-Kirk-Regenesis, &lt;/em&gt;is a thoroughly informative and a deeply personal read.It is afictionalized biography that takes place during Britain&#39;s &#39;Age of Enlightenment and Discovery&#39;and itis highly &#39;truth based,&#39;integrating the&#39;first written and compiled&#39; Polynesian facts and mythologythat includes thediaries andactual journals of the many men on board Cook&#39;s ships. No writer has better put together a more complete compilation of the factsintegrated with mythology and toldin novel form, giving the reader a bird&#39;s eye viewof the action. She touches on James Cook andhis co-relation with Gene Roddenberry&#39;s James T. Kirk and how it inter-relates with her own account of learned spiritual wisdom and her&#39;mythic writers journey.&#39; She gives a personalaccount of her journey that wasguided by the &#39;Aumakua&#39; (Hawaiian and British ancestors alike) and Archangel Metatron, to create a feature film script about James Cook that led her on a spiritual pilgrimage where she encountered the truth behind, reincarnation, remanifestation, archetypes and extraterrestrial realities. She then made a trip to Sarnath, India and also discovereda link to Polynesiawiththe name &#39;Lono&#39; (or Rono; the name Cook was referred to as when he arrived in Polynesia) and the &#39;Phurba Diety&#39;inancient Tibet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reviews&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important story that needs to be told and your writing is very good. See to it that the film gets produced.&lt;/p&gt;
