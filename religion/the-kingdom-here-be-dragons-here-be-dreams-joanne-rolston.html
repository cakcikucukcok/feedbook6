  <title>The Kingdom, Here Be Dragons, Here Be Dreams - Joanne Rolston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lost on a crooked path, Joanna couldn&#39;t see the wood for the trees. Denied her dreams, she&#39;d got caught up with Silver-tongue, an evil manipulative liar. Seeking a way out of the maze, she encountered the King, who she&#39;d been estranged from. She turned to him for counsel after discovering he was Abba, her Father. Leading Joanna to a narrow road, he told her to set up signposts and build landmarks. She was to set her heart on the highway leading to his Kingdom and a forgotten inheritance. But here be dragons, and Silver-tongue. She had to battle her way out of bewilderment in order to break free. Learning the King&#39;s will from the book he inspired, Joanna found that you can&#39;t live by bread alone. &quot;Call to me, and I will show you great and wonderful things&quot; the King promised. His word came alive. She dreamed dreams and followed signs. Given a shepherd&#39;s staff in the Valley of Shadow, Joanna was led along the Path of Righteousness. Picking up her lamp, she followed him towards the sunrise." />
