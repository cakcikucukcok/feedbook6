  <title>The Power Of Choice - C H Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;_Hlk513366849&quot;&gt;Do you want to make better choices in life? &amp;quot;The Power of Choice&amp;quot; is an extraordinary masterpiece that is the perfect tool that empowers people from all walks&amp;nbsp;of life to make better decisions. Life is not a game of chance but rather a matter of choice. We often see these choices as isolated events instead of connecting the dots between the choices we make and the things we experience.&amp;nbsp; In this book, Bishop Wright teaches that our choices, whether good or bad, will have a ripple effect on our life and often those that are connected to us.&amp;nbsp; He emphasizes the need to maintain a positive attitude even when we are faced with adversity and hardship.&amp;nbsp; Our words are powerful, and Bishop Wright reminds us to choose wisely what we say, especially in the pivotal moments in our life. There is a consequence to every choice that you make- some minor, others monumental- &amp;ldquo;Therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
