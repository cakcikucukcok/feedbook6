  <title>Unchained - M. Francis Schmidt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout history people have faced unbelievable, seemingly impossible situations through war, genocide, poverty and political oppression. Yet, even in those dire situations, they have prevailed against all odds through bold action and their deep faith in Christ. Unchained takes the reader amidst fourteen centuries of such amazing triumphsfrom the Battle of Tours in France through the Battle of Vienna in 1683 into the horrific Armenian genocide of the last century and then through the authors own rousing life. The stories will both astound and inspire you.
&lt;p&gt;
However, Unchained is more than an inspirational history lesson; it contains the amazing fairy tale The Knight and the Butterfly that is a vibrant, colorful and moving story for children and adults alike. There is also the probing, somewhat comical story The Question that tears both a man and the Bible apart, piece by piece, flaw by flaw, only to have the Godly truth revealed in the end.
&lt;p&gt;
If that isnt enough for the reader, Unchained includes dozens of the authors emotional poems of Poe-like dark and decadent design and then moves through his mystical and thought-provoking oeuvre.  The reader is then taken on one last, incredible trip through time with Archangel Gabriel from the beginning of time straight through to the rapture. The epic poem frames the evolution of earth and the beginning and the end of civilization, the struggle between faith and science as well as the dreadful failings and the astounding victories of man. How does the world end? Read it and find out. Even Nostradamus would raise an eyebrow.
&lt;p&gt;
However, Unchained is more than a collection of different tales and poetry. The astute reader will find common threads through all the stories, both in the characters and the action; moreover, that the real and the fictional are all inter-related. Discerning booklovers will recognize that, in fact, Unchained is one singular opus.&lt;br&gt;" />
