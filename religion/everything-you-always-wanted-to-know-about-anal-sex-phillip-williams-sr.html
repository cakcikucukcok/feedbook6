      <meta name="description" content="In Christ&#39;s love and patience, EYAWTKAAS, after revealing why, corrects and instructs some of the &quot;best&quot; people on the planet (because Jesus has somewhat against them). EYAWTKAAS uncovers by far the largest and most hypocritical cover-up in the history of the Christianity. Far surpassing Sodom and Gomorrah for wickedness is proved and so is the fact that much of the light of the world is in darkness. Because of God&#39;s love for marriage/family, He is &quot;pulling the covers.&quot; Don&#39;t be afraid/embarrassed to go with the author to higher heights in your Savior as he lists the reasons why this &quot;touchy&quot; subject is so hushed up under the steeples, why it persists, why many believers (not all) won&#39;t address it and why it must be addressed. Finally there are questions for discussion to help you confront this issue and help to get you in His image." />
