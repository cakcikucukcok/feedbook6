  <title>The Aspects of a Virtuous Woman - Sonia Williams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As you turn the pages of this book you will become intrigued at the personalities of the diff erent women mention in here. You will find that being virtuous is not about being perfect but about being godly. You will take a look into the life of women like Ruth, Hannah, and a few other women. It takes you from bible days to present time to show you that you&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;can live a virtuous live no matter your past.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you would like to learn more about how to submit in a Godly way then I would invite you to turn the page of this book. Many women think that submission means to be passive and unyielding (weak). Th is bible based&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;book will teach you that you are not submitting to the will of man but to the will of God while serving man. Each of the women that you are about to meet with each page turned will give you a different perspective&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt;as to what it truly means to submit. If you really want an understanding of Godly submission then this is the book for you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
