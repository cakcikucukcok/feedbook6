  <title>Heaven: You Can&#39;t Get There From Here - William Miller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It has been said that the best books are the result of a lifelong passion for a subject where an author is able to synthesize the words of hundreds of sources into a cohesive picture that even a layman can understand.  If this is true, Heaven: You Can&#39;t Get There From Here, based upon just such a lifetime of research, will for the first time provide a clear picture for those that have also spotted the gaps that exist in a worldview based solely upon the Bible and religious teachings.  This book is the result of a 60 year search to reconcile the Bible and religious teachings with the evidence of evolution and the natural history of life on Earth.   The author collected articles and newspaper clippings over 6 decades and synthesizes them here to give doubters a clearer understanding of reality and a defense against the guilt of Original Sin.  You are, after all, a child of the universe and you have a right to be here without exception or apology to anyone.  Heaven: You Can&#39;t Get There From Here will make it clear that if you do your best with what you are given the universe will find no fault.  Raised on a small farm the author was challenged to study the Bible from an early age by a kindly grandparent concerned for his â€œsalvationâ€?.  But each time he read the Bible, it left more questions than answers.  After discovering Robert Ardrey&#39;s African Genesis, the author realized there was even more about life on earth that the Bible didn&#39;t address.  Pulled into a lifelong pursuit of studying all the aspects that create the chasm between these two books, the author spent 60 years reading and collecting information to piece together a worldview that makes sense of it all and ultimately answers his Grandmother&#39;s question, â€œwhat&#39;s it all for then?â€?" />
