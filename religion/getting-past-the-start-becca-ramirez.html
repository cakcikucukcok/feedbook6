  <title>Getting Past the Start - Becca Ramirez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you ever feel so overwhelmed by the idea God has a purpose for your life you become immobilized by fear? Do you wonder how badly you can mess life up and still fulfill this purpose? God has a plan for your life. This simple phrase, meant to encourage, so often scares us into idleness. We dont know what to do, so instead we do nothing and fear what will happen if we fail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Getting Past the Start, author Becca Ramirez encourages Christians to be bold in their faith and run the race that God has placed before them with confidence. Through topics like the gifts of the spirit and the will of God, Ramirez shows we are more prepared to handle this life than we previously believed. She discusses realizing the potential that God has placed within us, allowing him to take control of that potential, and making sure that change becomes a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through scriptures and other sources, Getting Past the Start focuses on getting out of the blocks and running the race before us rather than watching from the sidelines. It tells us to overcome the fear that has paralyzed us and recognize God has equipped us to do all we are called to do.&lt;/p&gt;" />
