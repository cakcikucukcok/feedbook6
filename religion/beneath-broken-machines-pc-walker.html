  <title>Beneath Broken Machines - Pc Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Beneath Broken Machines is a cup of cold water to a dry, parched, and weary soul. In ministry, its easy to portray that I ONCE was lost...but now Ive got it all together. PC writes this book with humility and openness, which gives permission to confess that your machine is broken as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Travis Osborne, Pastor at Vintage Faith Church in Santa Cruz, CA &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who has left the church, this book spoke to me. Im not talking about an awakening with pomp and circumstance, but something more simple, beautiful, and powerful. PC has always been a guiding force in my life, and this incredibly powerful book is no different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- Kyle Lacy, 3x Author and National Speaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have a propensity to build machines out of our faith. We like to put in the right things in hopes it will churn out the right product. We become proud of the manufactured machines of faith we have built. The troubles with machines are they have no hearts and they break down. If your machine has broken down, you may have no idea what to do.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Embark on a search for the heart that still beats for you. Embrace the wonder and awe of the ridiculous love of God that has always been for you. Encounter the heart of the gospel, which is the heart of Jesus beneath all of your pain, failure, and shame.&lt;/p&gt;" />
