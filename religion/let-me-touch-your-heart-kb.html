      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Not just any encouragement will lift me up and guild me, Im in need of some real encouragement, living, lasting encouragement. Encouragement I can count on and trust not just for today but for my entire life. Im in need of those true words that will outlive me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can there be such a thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The writer this book wishes to only be known just as KB. This person truly believes its not the servant that truly  encourages but instead, the living God through His servants. God wants you to look to Him and Him only. Through this you will know that He (God that is) is forever reaching out to you. Daily, you may rise with many thoughts on your mind along with many duties to perform in a day. However, I wish you to know this truth. One thing and one thing only stays on Gods mind and in His heart. YOU.&lt;/p&gt;" />
