  <title>Dove Eyes, My Journey to Finding Purpose - Chinwe Kalu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Everyone has a specific purpose for which they were born. However, we don&#39;t arrive with a manual telling us what it is or how to go about finding it. We must discover it. The process can be drawn out and sometimes very discouraging. It&#39;s like going to school, where you learn, then do a test to confirm that you have actually imbibed what has been taught. There are high and low points in this learning process. There are many unexpected turns along the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dove Eyes, My Journey to Finding Purpose is about those high and low moments, about those unexpected turns. They all lead to the place where you discover what you&#39;re all about and can then walk in God&#39;s plan for your life. Chinwe tells her story to encourage and inspire people through the process. She answers some of the questions that plague people who are in the process. It&#39;s an easy to read story that will help people through the process of understanding themselves. Happy reading.&lt;/p&gt;" />
