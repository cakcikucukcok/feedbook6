  <title>God on Assignment as You - David Hulse D.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="GOD ON ASSIGNMENT AS YOU 
DAVID HULSE, D.D. 
We are not human beings having a spiritual experience; we are spiritual beings having a human experience. 
-Pierre Teilhard de Chardin 
I realize that this book may not be for everyone at this time. However, it is necessary to challenge the sensibilities of man-made traditions, which have made the word of present truth of no effect to this generation. I invite you to listen to your own inner Christ intelligence which is able to lead you to your truth, rather than listening to the feeble attempts of dogmatic voices who are only plunging us into the depths of unanswered questions. 
If you are in the process of re-examining old childhood beliefs and have realized there has to be a more excellent way, this book is for you. With this in mind, I invite you to open your minds and your hearts to this great process of incarnation, when an adventurous playful Creator chose to experience and play the game of humanity with all of its diversity. 
My premise is that a Creator could not create anything less than itself as that would result in pity. Creating anything greater than itself would result in admiration. Only creating that which is equal results in love! You are the creator experiencing the richness of this human journey. You are god on assignment! 
Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God. 
-Phil. 2:5-6 KJV" />
