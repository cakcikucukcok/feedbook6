  <title>In This Place - Kim L. Abernethy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1985 Kim Abernethy, along with her husband, Jeff, followed a call from God to minister in the small West African country of Liberia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She writes of the fall of one of her daughters from a two-story building, shares candid emotions from when her husband had a close call with Lassa Fever, and delightfully chronicles many of her husband&amp;#39;s adventures of being a bush pilot in the jungle of Liberia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether you are intrigued by the stories of foreign missionaries and how they adapt to a new culture or are heading towards the mission &amp;iuml;&amp;#172;?eld yourself, you will &amp;iuml;&amp;#172;?nd this book enlightening and inspiring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Inside you will &amp;iuml;&amp;#172;?nd disbelief, tragedy, fear, anxiety, discontentment, and confusion, but there is also humor, delight, amazement, wonder, surrender, and a deep-seated joy as you watch how God - little by little - chipped away at the walls of pride, disbelief, stubbornness, and independence that had held Kim captive.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is an irresistible story of an infallible God proving Himself more than enough in every fathomable circumstance.
