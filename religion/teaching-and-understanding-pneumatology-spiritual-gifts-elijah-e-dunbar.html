  <title>Teaching and Understanding Pneumatology &amp; Spiritual Gifts - Elijah E. Dunbar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The geographical extent of the orient and occident is a validation of the cultural and ideological differences that have existed with constancies between the two hemispheres throughout the ions of time. Ideological pluralism has been the common practice of the inhabitants of both spheres but with unique manifestations. Christianity along with other religions are warmly embraced and pragmatically characterized by the orientals and occidentals with reserved peculiarities. Oriental Christians viewed pneumatology as being a significant particle of their theological and liturgical lives, while Occidental Christians see Christology as the primal substance in Christianity. Although both groups have a history of singling out this distinction, over the years, theologians and theology have helped both sides understand the importance of both pneumatology and Christology in Christianity. It is concertedly understood that neither of the two can be studied or taught without the other. Their inseparable existence makes Christianity a complete whole.
The authors exploration and literary expedition through myriad of sources allow him to compile data relevant to understanding the importance of the Holy Ghost and Spiritual gifts within the Christian community. Whether a secular or non-secular intellectual, you will find the information in this book to be rewarding, resourceful and informative. You will come across comments from some of humanitys and Christendoms finest and brightest academics in an eclectic form. Join the author now on his literary expedition. Welcome!" />
