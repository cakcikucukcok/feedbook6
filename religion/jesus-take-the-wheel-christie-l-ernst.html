  <title>Jesus, Take the Wheel - Christie L. Ernst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever had a series of events happen in your life that you didnt have control over? Life is a journey filled with lessons, hardships, and joy. Sometimes the road ahead is straight and easy to follow, other times unexpected detours wait for us around the corner. Through this journey there will be challenges that test our courage, strength, weakness, and faith. Jesus, Take the Wheel is about calling on Jesus when our lives feel out of control, and we need guidance. Even when we feel we are going in the wrong direction and God seems out of sight, we can find comfort in knowing Jesus has the wheel. When we trust in Jesus and surrender our lives over to him, we can be assured that we will end up safely at our destination when he is leading. When time goes by, we will learn more about ourselves, as well as grow in our relationship with Jesus Christ. God knows exactly where we are going and how we will get there. As we navigate through life, we need to constantly ask God for directions. Jesus didnt say it would be easy; he said it would be worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A DAILY DEVOTIONAL BOOK &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WITH A MESSAGE!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What do you want for your life? Do you want peace? Do you want to feel free? Do you want to feel loved? Do you want to experience life the way God intended it to be? Then why not try Jesus, Take the Wheel, and let Jesus take you to your destination safely.&lt;/p&gt;" />
