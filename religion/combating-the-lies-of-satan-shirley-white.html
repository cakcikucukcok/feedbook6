  <title>Combating the Lies of Satan - Shirley White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Satan is on a rampage; he has inundated our world with a multiplicity of dangerous lies and is convincing men to feast on them while rejecting Gods holy Word. However, even though Satans concocting these lies, man is not an innocent party to this deception; Satan may be spreading lies, but man entertains them of his own volition and perpetuates them. Man is electing to reject God and the doctrinal teachings of the Bible; he prefers to indulge teachings that ?agrantly contradict Scripture. Man is Satans accomplice; he is complicit and culpable because he disregards the Word of God and chooses lies over truth. 
Average people have no clue theyre being deceived by a clever and diabolical spirit. Satans deception and cleverness are so astute that hes convinced many to believe the lie that he doesnt exist. However, he does exist, and the purpose of this book is to expose him, his lies, and his deceptions and to expose, refute, and combat the numerous deadly lies so prevalent in our world today that many have embraced.
Much in this book will be seen by many as controversial and politically incorrect, but this book is factual and biblically sound; it will equip you with knowledge and insights from the Word of God to prevent you from falling prey to Satans deceptions. 
God loves you, Jesus died for you, and it is my prayer that you carefully consider and investigate everything in this book and make the crucial decision to believe God and His Word versus Satan and his lies." />
