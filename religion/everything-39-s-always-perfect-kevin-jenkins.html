  <title>Everything&#39;s Always Perfect - Kevin Jenkins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Being equally yoked is the difference between having a successful relationship versus an unsuccessful one. Effective relationships may have people who are alike or opposites. When you care about someone and you are unsure what to ask from God, this book will provide you with fourteen biblically based spiritual scripts, which will elevate you and your loved one out of a broken situation. Speak or read these scriptures to your situation with confidence each day, until you have them memorized. Then reflect on how your situation has changed. Not every relationship has to end in marriage, but it should end with respect and dignity. Praying, along with fasting, and increased self-awareness, will help things work out. More importantly, improve your relationship with God by journaling your journey then spread the good news to others. If it is to be, its up to me. #perfect" />
