  <title>What&#39;s My Name? - Karen Hodge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Shakespeare wrote Whats in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet! Juliet proclaims that a name is an artificial and meaningless convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some may believe that names are neutral or insignificant, but God knows the power in names. He was very purposeful when naming His people, knowing that every time they heard their name, they heard His will and purpose for their life.  (Abrams name was changed to Abraham, for he was destined to be the father of many nations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karen Hodge, in Whats My Name? Vignettes of Seventy Incredible Bible Characters, has compiled an impressive collection of characters and takes us on a journey through the personal lives of patriarchs, prophets, kings, queens, wives, lovers, and people with unfamiliar names but who are indeed important to Scriptural history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hodge has not only found a unique way to teach Bible history through these incredible individuals and their intertwined lives, but challenges you to dig a little deeper into Scripture and discover a thing or two more about each character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you explore these vignettes and meet the people profiled, youll discover their humanity and perhaps view them in new light as they left their mark and fulfilled their destiny.  Moreover, the significance of every person mentioned in the great narrative of the Bible will become abundantly clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only will you learn the names and stories of these seventy incredible Bible characters, youll find yourself eagerly anticipating future collections of vignettes!&lt;/p&gt;
