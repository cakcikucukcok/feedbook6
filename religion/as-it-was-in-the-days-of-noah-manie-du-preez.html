  <title>As It Was in the Days of Noah - Manie Du Preez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Doom, gloom, tribulation, apocalypse, Armageddon, 2012,
plaques, earthquakes, wars, rumours of warsthese have
all become synonymous with what we call the end-times. Is this
really the end that the creator of heaven and earth had in mind
when He created all things? Did He fail in His original plan? Has
He lost his grip on creation? Is He still in control? How did He
plan to end what He started? Will there be a rapture? Will there
be great tribulation? Will it end in war and ruins? Or does the God
of the universe have a far greater plan than most men anticipate?
Let us travel back in time to the days of Noah and get some insight
into Gods plans for creation. As He said:
But as THE DAYS OF NOAH were, so also will the coming of
the Son of Man be." />
