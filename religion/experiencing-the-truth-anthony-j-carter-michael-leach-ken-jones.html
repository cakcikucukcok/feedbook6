  <title>Experiencing the Truth - Anthony J. Carter, Michael Leach, Ken Jones</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Experiencing the Truth&lt;/cite&gt; communicates the need of a vibrant, experiential, Reformed Christianity among African-Americans and all believers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;How does a believer choose a church to attend? Sadly too many Christians search for churches that serve them and meet their perceived needs. Instead they should prefer places where God is exalted and biblical truth and Christian doctrine are proclaimed. Such churches are essential if Christians are to understand what God is doing and what he calls His people to be.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Experiencing the Truth&lt;/cite&gt; presents these truths not simply to African-American churches, but also to the whole church today. Anthony Carter, Michael Leach, and Ken Jones clearly present the need for a vibrant, experiential, Reformed Christianity among African-Americans. These authors lay out the biblical basis for choosing and attending a church, and they demonstrate how the historic Reformed expression has been the most biblically accurate and experientially consistent expression of Christianity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
