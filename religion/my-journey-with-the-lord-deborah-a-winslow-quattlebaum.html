  <title>My Journey with the Lord - Deborah A. Winslow-Quattlebaum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A bout with cancer led me to writing these notes while I took my journey with the Lord. This book has two purposes: (1) to motivate those with life-threatening diseases to want to live and (2) to give hope to those in despair who need their hearts lifted. I pray that you allow yourself to take a journey with the Lord through this book and also allow yourself to get comfortable by being in peace. The Lord gave me the purpose to write these notes and you will receive your purpose, but in order to receive it you must be living a godly life. You must believe and have faith in the Lord. Be not afraid when He reveals your purpose, because everyone does not have the same purpose. I ask that you take a risk and get to know Jesus for yourself; then spread your joy to others, and they will spread their joy to others. This book is to reach as many lost souls as possible, to bring them back to Jesus so they can walk their journey with the Lord." />
