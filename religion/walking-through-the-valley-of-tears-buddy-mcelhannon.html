  <title>Walking Through the Valley of Tears - Buddy McElhannon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Silence is like a burglar alarm that wont turn off. Grief must like silence; the mere whisper of a cry or hint of a tear and Grief makes its presence known. Silence is a megaphone for Grief. A constant that is a deafening reminder of what I am missing. Yet, I find at times it also promotes a quietness with my Lord. Somehow I need to find a way to cherish the solitude in a positive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proving once again that Gods light is brightest when our hour is darkest, Walking through the Valley of Tears is one mans surprising discovery of unending grace at his time of greatest grief. This is a must read for anyone experiencing loss or needing affirmation of Gods limitless love.&lt;br&gt;
Rosemary Clair, author of Heir of Earth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When your body is exhausted and your soul is parched, you can find unexpected comfort, nurture, rest, and renewal in the darkness of the valley. Buddy McElhannon reminds us that resources are abundant in the valley as the living water pours forth through tears and grief gives way to the riches only heartache can cultivate. Heartwarming, honest, and hopeful, Buddy gently invites us all to journey together with Christ through the depths of the valley and introduces us to good soil, calm water, and the protected canopy that God provides so we can once again shout with joy from the mountaintop. I promise that Buddy will be a helpful guide as you find strength in weakness, hope in despair, and joy in journey while Walking through the Valley of Tears.&lt;br&gt;
