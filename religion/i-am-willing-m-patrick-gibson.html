  <title>I Am Willing - M. Patrick Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am willing&amp;quot;. Those are the words of Jesus when asked by the leper if He was inclined to heal. It should settle the argument. But tradition and dogma have &lt;strong&gt;entombed&lt;/strong&gt; believers. Instead of the church bringing &lt;strong&gt;resurrection&lt;/strong&gt; power and miraculous living, all we offer is bad answers to old questions. Is healing for today? Does God want to heal everybody? Surely He wants to heal some people, but not me. Doesn&amp;#39;t God make bad things happen in people&amp;#39;s lives because we sin? Isn&amp;#39;t God using affliction to chastise or punish us? If I&amp;#39;m sick, it&amp;#39;s because God has sovereignly chosen for me to learn from suffering or to bring Him glory... &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YOU&amp;#39;VE HEARD IT All BEFORE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOW IT&amp;#39;S TIME TO HEAR THE TRUTH.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is none of these concepts are Biblical. Tolerating sickness and disease in the life of a believer didn&amp;#39;t become a Christian belief until after the time of Constantine. The idea that God is sovereignly in control of everything that happens on the planet didn&amp;#39;t take root until 400 years after Christ. God wants you to know:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He isn&amp;#39;t mysterious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He isn&amp;#39;t willing sickness and disease into your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He isn&amp;#39;t judging you or anyone else right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He isn&amp;#39;t punishing or chastising you either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cannot do what He has authorized you to do, because He has chosen to limit His sovereignty to His Word. Only one thing can stop you&amp;nbsp;from receiving your miracle, but He has given you the power to&lt;strong&gt; leave the grave&lt;/strong&gt; and walk in miracles. Nothing contained in these pages is opinion or conjecture. It is all pulled directly from the Bible. It&amp;#39;s 100% irrefutable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oh yeah, and Jesus... He healed everybody, all the time.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And He is willing to heal you too.&lt;/p&gt;" />
