Judas.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;No one has ever sacrificed anything for God. &amp;nbsp;If you always get back more than you gave up, have you sacrificed anything at all? &amp;nbsp;The eternal reward always outweighs the temporal sacrifice.&amp;nbsp; At the end of the day, our greatest regret will be whatever we didn’t give back to God.
