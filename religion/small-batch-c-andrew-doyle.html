  <title>Small Batch - C. Andrew Doyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Small Batch explores the emerging denominational movement into planting missional communities. As the church finds its way into the new millennium, it is faced with the need to think of its mission as an ancient future Christian community. Theology to practical guide, stories from the front and communities to discover, books to read, and small group study questions make Small Batch a handbook for individuals interested in the growing movement of planting new Christian communities. Through the movement of the spirit and shared common life and staying deeply rooted in the ancient practices of Christian community, the denominational church is being reborn in a new mission context. Small batch communities are popping up across the country with a new mission fervor. They are locally focused. They are organic and deeply rooted in the community and derive their strength from the care they give to local concerns. They are sustainable because they begin to find new economies that support the work. Bishop Doyle explores the sending churches that are planting greenfield ministries and multiplying churches who are spinning off new contextually oriented mission communities. What we discover in Small Batch is that the gospel will not be deterred by size or economic realities, and we are even now able to see the future shape of very diverse Christian mission." />
