  <title>Servanthood as Worship: The Privilege of Life in a Local Church - Nate Palmer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are countless books on Christian leadership&amp;hellip;whatever happened to servanthood?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Browse a Christian book website or bookstore and notice all there is for leaders and would-be leaders. There are studies of leaders, keys to leadership, and tips on becoming a leader. Even the books that &lt;em&gt;promote &lt;/em&gt;servanthood tend to be &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; leadership.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But how many books inspire us simply to serve one another? The appeal of leadership has hijacked the biblical call to servanthood. As a result, we major on a role that will only ever be held by a few, and we largely ignore a role that ought to be held by every Christian. Whatever happened to servanthood?&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Servanthood as Worship&lt;/em&gt; offers Christians a biblical understanding of their calling to serve in the church, motivated by the grace that is ours in the gospel. It has the potential to revitalize service teams in churches across the world, from church plants to long-established congregations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
