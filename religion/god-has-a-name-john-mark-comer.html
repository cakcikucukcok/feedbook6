  <title>God Has a Name - John Mark Comer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;There aren&#39;t many questions in life that if you find the answer to them, it can change everything. But asking who God is and what he is like are two of those questions, and John Mark Comer brilliantly answers them in this book.&quot; -Jefferson Bethke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of us ache for relationship with God, yet feel distant and disconnected from him. As if he&#39;s more of an idea we believe in our head than a person we relate to. But God has a name: Yahweh. This one simple idea has the potential to radically alter how you relate to God, not as a doctrine, but as a relational being who responds to you in an elastic, back-and-forth way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do we feel this gap between us and God? Could it be that a lot of what we think about God is wrong? Not all wrong, but wrong enough to mess up how we relate to him? What if our &quot;God&quot; is really a projection of our own identity, ideas, and desires? And what if the real God is different, but far better than we could ever imagine?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book is a simple, but profound guide to what God says about himself. In his signature conversational-but-smart style, John Mark Comer takes you line by line through Exodus 34:6-8--Yahweh&#39;s self-revelation on Mount Sinai--called by some scholars the one most quoted verse in the Bible, by the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wherever you are in your spiritual journey, who God is just might surprise you--and change everything.&lt;/p&gt;" />
