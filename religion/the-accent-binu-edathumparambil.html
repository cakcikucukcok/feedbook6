But we also experience enormous difficulties in our personal and communal living. We long for happy and fulfilling lives, but more often than not, we fall far short of that ideal. Taken as a whole, our personal development and interpersonal relationships are often far from satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study and guide considers how we function as human beings and suggests ways to overcome our difficulties and live fuller and happier lives. Blending psychology and spirituality, with a particular focus on Jesus and his message, author Binu Edathumparambil explores the different contours and corners of our lives and presents some hard truths. Looking at our lifestyles from a new perspective, we can overcome our individual differencesthe accents that shape usand develop healthier and more vibrant lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Offering a road map to the fulfillment of ideals and dreams, The Accent presents reflections and guidance on some of the most important dynamics in our journey of life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
