  <title>The Prayer of My Life:How God Changed Me in Seven Months - Tony Portugal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What makes this book extremely unique is that the story portion, minus the editing process, was actually written in less than one week.  The principles, which are at the end of the story, were written during Tonys journey in his initial seven months with God.  In Tonys own words he says:  I was not raised in church.  I have never known God.  Truthfully, I have never actually known myself.  My familys love and their concerns for my well-being had always fallen on deaf ears.  Simply by establishing my life around counterfeit friends, it forced me to live in the darkest reality of my time.  What changed?  I went to kill a manand instead Jesus interfered.  It is quite unbelievable how believable God really is. The Bible would become the first Book I ever read.  Did I understand it at first?  No.  But the Bible is not based on logical thinking, but illogical people.  Lord, I refuse to leave Your presence until You bring out of me what You promised was in me.  With that same perspective, the Bible contains a power that enables us to go beyond ourselves.  Its mind-blowing how within seven months God can flip your world inside out!" />
