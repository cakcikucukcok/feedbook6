  <title>Restoring the Kingdom: The Role of God as the &quot;Ordainer of Times and Seasons&quot; in the Acts of the Apostles - Michael A. Salmeier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the book of Acts divine involvement is everywhere. From the beginning God is responsible for promised action, including the geographic expansion--in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth (1:7)--referenced in Jesus&#39; response to the disciples, clearly related to Luke&#39;s purpose in writing the book. Geographic expansion, however, is only the second part of Jesus&#39; reply. Is it possible that the first half of Jesus&#39; reply--It is not for you to know the times or dates the Father has set by his own authority--has even greater bearing on the actions that follow and on Luke&#39;s purpose? Is the Father setting times and seasons related to the kingdom&#39;s establishment? Does this phrase explain the conspicuous divine involvement throughout the plot? In Restoring the Kingdom, Michael Salmeier answers these questions in the affirmative by exploring Luke&#39;s characterization of God in three strands: God as the King who establishes and restores Israel&#39;s king, who establishes his people, and who directs events. This unfolds Luke&#39;s purpose in assuring the reader concerning the events that have taken place, helping to more fully illuminate Luke&#39;s theology concerning God and his kingdom." />
