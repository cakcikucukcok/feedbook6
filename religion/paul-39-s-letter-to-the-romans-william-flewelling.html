      <meta name="description" content="The Bible studies I chose to do in answer to the request of my first congregation out of seminary sought to present a serious, somewhat-scholarly approach to the interested among my parishioners.

I was most interested in finding what the author or compiler or editor, as the case may be, sought to convey. I have found the studies of value to me personally and professionally and felt that they were generally well received as I led them.
