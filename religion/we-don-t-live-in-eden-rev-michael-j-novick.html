  <title>We Don’T Live in Eden - Rev. Michael J. Novick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The challenge I think I face in writing this book is going to be that I dont want anyone who reads it to think that I am whining about my ministry as a Catholic priest.  What I hope to accomplish by writing the book is to help educate all of society about our life.  I knew that when I embarked upon this writing this book, the topic would be a living and breathing piece that changes constantly.  No one day is the same as the next, and rarely is any day the same as any other.  Ministry changes and challenges because Gods people change  their hopes, needs, dreams, and their relationship with God amongst other things.
This book is not meant to be definitive in nature by any stretch.  Its my experience and my vision.  You may get to know a little more about me through some journal entries Ive included.  I truly hope that those who read it will grow in their appreciation for the Catholic Church and remember to pray for all priests  those who have gone before us, all present priests, and the hopeful priests for the future of the Church  the Church which is one, holy, Catholic, and apostolic.
Enjoy!" />
