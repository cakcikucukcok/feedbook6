  <title>Strength for Life&#39;s Struggles - Chrisshone L. Swayne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Has there ever been a time when you ever said the following words: Oh Lord give me strength? Was there ever a time when it seemed as if your strength was &quot;failing&quot; or &quot;leaving&quot; you? The weighted &quot;blocks of life&quot; are continually falling down on you, and you feel no relief at all. Your &quot;tank of tolerance&quot; is also at an all time low, and on top of that your &quot;day-to-day&quot; items in the &quot;stuff bag&quot; called &quot;life&quot; is just about full.&lt;P&gt;
	Well, I have great news for you! Where your &quot;strength&quot; falls short, God&#39;s strength stands up! For the bible declares in II Corinthians 12:9, &quot;My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.&quot; In fact, Jesus has a 100% guarantee on any affliction, struggle or trial you may be experiencing. This 100% guarantee is by way of the &quot;Afflictions Benefits Package.&quot; The Lord defines it in these terms in Psalm 34:19, &quot;Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.&quot; In other words, it&#39;s a &quot;fixed fight&quot; and a for sure win despite the hardships encountered.&lt;P&gt;
	Each morning that heaven claps it&#39;s hands and says &quot;wake up,&quot; we&#39;ve got to know that we are on God&#39;s mind. He&#39;s ready to give us the assurance, guidance, and strength that we need for our journey through all life&#39;s struggles." />
