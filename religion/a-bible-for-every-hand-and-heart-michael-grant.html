  <title>A Bible for Every Hand and Heart - Michael Grant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book sets forth an urgent plea for individual involvement in making the Bible available worldwide to mankind in the language they understand best. Drawing together three rare, out-of-print nineteenth-century works from his own personal collection, the editor, Michael Grant, has revised these items so they are more easily read and understood by our generation. These revised rarities form the three main sections of this book. 
The first encompasses all the spoken material of the service held in 1812 commissioning Americas first foreign missionaries, of which Adoniram Judson is the most well known of the group. Original source material from this event enhances the value and interest of this first section.
The second is a sermon preached in Salem, Massachusetts by Benjamin Wadsworth in 1815 to the Salem Bible Society. (Yes, it is that Salem, the witch trials Salem!) In addition to this sermon, the Salem Bible Society Trustees Report is included for its research value and, primarily, for the enthusiastic desire it conveys for Bible translation, printing, and distribution. 
The third is a sermon delivered by Baron Stow in 1846 to the American and Foreign Bible Society on the occasion of its ninth anniversary.
Many truths are pinpointed in each sections content in preparation for specific options of how individuals can be personally involved as willing, skillful workers in the Bible Society world and the work of Bible translation so that people worldwide might have the Scriptures for the first time in their languages." />
