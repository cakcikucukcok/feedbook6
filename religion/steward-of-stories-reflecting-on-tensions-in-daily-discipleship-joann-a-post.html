  <title>Steward of Stories: Reflecting on Tensions in Daily Discipleship - JoAnn A. Post</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Drawn from three decades of parish ministry experience, Steward of Stories opens the delightfully complex and nuanced world of the congregation to a wider audience beyond, but including, local parish pastors. Each chapter brings together dramatically different stories about ordinary ministry situations organized around a core thematic connection, including pastoral incidents focused on topics like Paying Attention, Marry Me, and Time to Go. Linking these together is the interwoven wisdom of an experienced pastor who encourages readers to consider the theological and ministry challenges at stake for us all. Clearly written and highly accessible, these vignettes are meant for lay and clergy audiences alike, especially as they come together in their mutual life in Christian community. These are stories about real people drawn from actual events--accounts that will prompt thoughtful contemplation and conversation among the faithful about saints and sinners in everyday congregations and situations. Each chapter concludes with helpful questions for use in both educational settings and individual study. This book is ideal for personal reflection or group discussion and will stimulate a richer awareness of the challenges and opportunities we all face in the ministries we share." />
