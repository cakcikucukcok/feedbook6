Feeling both defeated and deflated it was time to live healthy.  Many years of eating the wrong foods, lack of exercise and nutrition finally caught up with her.  After seeing a research study that 95 to 97 percent of people, who lose weight gain it back, plus more within 2 to 4 years, she was determined to beat the odds.  With extensive research, education, trial and error and nearly 2 years later, she loses 96 pounds and is taken off of blood pressure medication for good.  Keeping the weight off now for nearly 6 years she has proven that statistics don&#39;t dictate her future.  She shares the real reason for obesity and why many people struggle keeping the weight off!" />
