  <title>A Woman&#39;s Wisdom - Lydia Brownback</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Advice books are no short-lived trend. They continue to top bestseller lists even though much of the &amp;ldquo;wisdom&amp;rdquo; being offered proves shallow in the long run. People are looking for practical, proven advice for life and the book of Proverbs is the wisest place to start.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unpacking the book of Proverbs, Lydia Brownback shows how the Bible speaks to real life issues such as money, purity, marriage, and the day-to-day grind. Writing with a familiar yet knowledgeable tone, Brownback draws in the busiest of readers and asks realistic questions for personal reflection or group study. This well-conceived, twelve chapter book contains three parts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;What Is Wisdom and Why Does It Matter?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Six Things Wise Women Know&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Portrait of Wisdom&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Woman&amp;rsquo;s Wisdom&lt;/em&gt; gives women&amp;mdash;a way to be wise, to know the very Author of wisdom, and to understand how to apply his relevant, riches.&lt;/p&gt;" />
