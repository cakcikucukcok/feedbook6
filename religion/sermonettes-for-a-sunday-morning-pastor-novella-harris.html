  <title>Sermonettes for a Sunday Morning - Pastor Novella Harris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Approximately four years ago, Ia healthy, energetic, independent womanbecame so ill that I was practically bedridden. I needed assistance for all the things I took for granted in my daily life.
Before my illness, I exhorted Sunday morning service, preached Gods Word, and ministered to the congregation. I had always been considered hyperactive. I worked out four days a week. I tried to be the dedicated wife and mother that God had instructed women to be. I worked as a public school teacher and as executive director of Sure Foundation Child Care Inc.; I maintained an immaculate house and the Grace Cathedral International complex.
I pastored along with my husband, Bishop R. W. Harris. We were a team. We were visionaries. With Gods help, I would make sure I encouraged, not hindered, his visions for the ministry, and he did the same for mine. God moved in miraculous ways for us.
It was difficult for me to comprehend suddenly becoming so ill I could barely function. This illness (that has yet to be completely determined) became what I thought at the time, a sour lemon in my life. I never asked God why but what. What do you want me to do in this situation? I was inspired to make sweet lemonade with my sour lemon.
God allowed me to write this book in my limited physical condition. Because I was not able to stand and preach from the pulpit, I wrote a sermonette for the Sunday morning bulletin each week. Some of the sermonettes were a series that covered several Sundays. God has blessed me to use those weekly sermonettes for this book." />
