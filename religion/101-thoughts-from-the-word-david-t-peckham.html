  <title>101 Thoughts from the Word: - David T. Peckham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From Gods mouth to the hearts of his people - this is the function of the Bible and is the reason it is called the Word of God. The Bible applied to the heart by the Holy Spirit is the chief means by which men are built up and established in the faith, after their conversion. It is able to cleanse them, sanctify them, to instruct them in righteousness, and to furnish them thoroughly for all good works (2 Tim. 3:1617) (J. C. Ryle. 
After many years of anger against God, the author was wonderfully restored by the Lord to himself and laid the burden of this ministry on his heart. Every week for the past fourteen years, TFTWs (Thoughts from the Word) have been sent via the Internet to Gods people throughout the world. Many similar thoughts may be found at www.onhisshoulders.com. 
The thoughts contained in this volume are published with the sincere prayer that God will use them to refresh and encourage the souls of his people. To receive future weekly TFTWs, send your request to dave4thoughts@gmail.com" />
