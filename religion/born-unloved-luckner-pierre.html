  <title>Born Unloved - Luckner Pierre</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Born Unloved is inspired by a true story. Pierre wrote this autobiography book to help people fully understand the importance of unconditional love to humanity. His mother never loved him. His father abandoned him. Darkness of fear paralyzed his heart. His speech impediment frustrated him. His grandmother had no vision for him. 
Bitter days awaited him. Demons poisoned his soul. He was mistaken for a problem child. Loneliness angered him. He drowned in depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in one country but raised in another, Pierres bilingual childhood explains the conflict between three different cultures.
While his life could have been born unloved in any nation of this world, Pierres life still adapted to Gods plans that encourages and edifies his character. On the road of gaining spiritual growth, his life led to a detour where the language of love is uncommon.
He learns to rebuild the street culture by spreading the message of love that saved him from death. His vision is to enlighten and edify everyone with the language of love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supreme wisdom guided Pierre even when he least expected. After falling in love with the gift of encouragement, his heart feels alive again.
Without unconditional love, Pierre would not have overcome the emotional pains he endured since his childhood. He forgave his dysfunctional family and those who mistreated and neglected him. Love is a blessing. Let it shine on earth. Everyone needs to be thirsty for love. Let the words of love be written on your heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
