  <title>Early Morning Walks with God - Laurel Stanell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Every morning, Laurel Stanell takes a walk on a curvy, somewhat hilly road that stretches around the lake by her North Carolina home. It is lined with trees, bushes, flowers, houses, little creatures, and a golf course. But it is here that she finds God, talks to him, and gains strength for the day ahead.&lt;br /&gt;Filled with encouragement, Early Morning Walks with God is a compilation of personal insights from Stanell collected over the course of a year of daily walks. Written in easy-to-read prose, these short and succinct entries expand upon the promises God has bestowed upon his people. Stanells observations on natures beauty, the ever-changing weather, and the daily encounters with her neighbors provide inspiration for those who seek a new way to look at the world.&lt;br /&gt;Stanell examines how growth in both nature and in our lives is nourished under Gods direction. She also focuses on the positive aspects of the world instead of the negative, turning instead to Gods message of hope, his constant companionship, and his direction.&lt;br /&gt;Early Morning Walks with God offers precious gems of wisdom for your daily time with God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
