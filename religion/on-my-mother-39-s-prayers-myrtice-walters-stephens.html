  <title>On My Mother&#39;s Prayers - Myrtice Walters Stephens</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book is to glorify Gods grace and mercy, to save our children from a generation that is destined to die.&lt;/p&gt;
STOP eleven-year-old middle-schoolstudents from hanging themselves. Listen to the cries from our children through their poetry and behavior. To save our children, we have to instill in your child a sense of self-worth, selfesteem and the love of God. Behind every delinquent child is a search for
love and attention to fill the hole in his or her heart that was left by the absence of a mother or father that left him or her for drugs, jail, or just abandoned him or her. Teach them the power of prayer to heal the hole in our childrens hearts. Teach our children that knowing the Twenty-Third Psalm will give them comfort knowing that God is their Shepherd and will
lead and protect them throughout their lives. Teach our children the Ten Commandments, what is right from wrong in Gods eyes, not mans rules, moral codes of conduct to live by. Let us give our children Gods keys of life: prayer, the Twenty-Third Psalm, and the Ten Commandments. Lets save the children! Lets save the babies!" />
