  <title>666 Revealed, Book Ii - Jack H. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There appears to be no cessation of written material relating to End Times theology generally; and to the Apocalypse, specifically. Sadly, much, if not most of it runs counter to the clear teachings of Scripture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A misquoted verse here, and an extrapolation there: one wonders when the dust will finally settle, and a spiritually, and scripturally accurate picture will begin to emerge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this volume, Jack Smith explores the issues with due diligence, searching the Scriptures, and ever seeking the Guidance of the Holy Ghost with all soberness of thought and attitude. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who (or what) is the antichrist? Who is the false prophet; and Who (or what) is the whore of Babylon? With the Bible in one hand, and a prayer for Guidance ever on his lips, Jack Smith has discovered, and here reveals, the answer to those questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author is keenly aware that these Truths will not be eagerly received by the bulk of Modern Christendom. And so much the worse, as there has never been a time they are more pertinent, more relevant, and more necessary to know than in this present hour as we approach the eclipse of human history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
