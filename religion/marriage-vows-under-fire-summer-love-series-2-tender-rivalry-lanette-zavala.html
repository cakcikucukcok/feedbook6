  <title>Marriage Vows Under Fire Summer Love Series 2: Tender Rivalry - Lanette Zavala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Natalie and Joseph Reyes continue to juggle the drama of everyone else&amp;#39;s lives while trying to strengthen their loving marriage that only feels drained. Escaping growing problems at home with her husband, Natalie opens the door of a strange connection between her brother and her executive assistant in the workplace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Tony Taylor and Amelia Conrad contend for an open vice-president position at Millennium Fashion House. One of the required challenges for the job is to transform homeless kids and inner city high school misfits into classy Millennium models for an upcoming marketing campaign. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The no-nonsense Amelia may have the ambition to successfully win the vice-president job. But her cut-throat perfectionism is no match for her softening heart toward the rough inner city teenagers with whom she has to work - and her secret love for Tony. When there is a high-profile career to achieve versus the unlikely fulfillment of her dream to win the handsome bachelor&amp;#39;s heart, there should be one choice to make. Business. But her heart&amp;#39;s desire for the man, who rejected her in the past, risks her goal to defeat him as a contending executive. Tony struggles with his own developing feelings toward the tyrant whom he had long ago learned to shun as a person. But right within their competitive environment, he notices Amelia&amp;#39;s sweet change toward the poor community he loves. A popular player among women with desires for status and everything that comes with it, he can&amp;#39;t understand why he can&amp;#39;t get Amelia out of his mind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Centered by a host of other developing relationships within their circle of friends, Amelia and Tony reflect on a bitter past as an obstacle that stands between them. Theirs is a complicated love story between two people who don&amp;#39;t want to be in love - at least, not with each other for reasons neither is willing to mention." />
