  <title>The Art of The Saint John&#39;s Bible: The Complete Reader&#39;s Guide - Susan Sink</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the time that pages of &lt;i&gt;The Saint John&#39;s Bible&lt;/i&gt; began touring in   major exhibitions nearly a decade ago, people have been moved, captivated, and  inspired by this stunning work of modern sacred art. But they often have questions   about the illuminations that are scattered throughout the Bible, especially as they  first become familiar with it. Why was a certain Scripture passage chosen for   illumination rather than another? What materials and source imagery are behind  the illuminations? &lt;i&gt;The Art of&lt;/i&gt; The Saint John&#39;s Bible provides answers to these important questions and many others.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Initially published in a series of three volumes, each book has now been revised by the author and included together in this helpful single volume. Since&lt;i&gt;The Saint John&#39;s Bible&lt;/i&gt; is now complete, Susan Sink makes connections between recurring images and motifs throughout the work and reflects on the images with a view to the whole. Her book promises to intensify and expand the  experience of all who come in contact with &lt;i&gt;The Saint John&#39;s Bible&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
