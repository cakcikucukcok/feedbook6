  <title>Opening the Matrix - Chief Apostle Diana Wright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For anyone who would like to be a gifted, holy vesselto be among those who are chosen, set apart, and used by God in a unique way with dreams, visions, revelations, and manifestationsOpening the Matrix: A Journey Beyond the Veil is the perfect midwife to bring forth a greater calling in your life. Chief Apostle Diana Wright speaks to those who are striving to increase their faith in God, with the honest and sincere truth of an obedient servant living with the ear, eye, and heart of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Included in this comprehensive handbook are photos of the eye of God, the handwriting of Jesus, an image of Michael Jackson appearing from the dead along with the words he spoke, and other astounding encounters and visitations. Written to help others learn how to recognize their self-worth, Opening the Matrix enables everyone to experience the favor of God through Jesus Christ, as He comforts and guides us with vivid consciousness and trust into a broader perspective of the kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we are stagnated in our spiritual growth and face difficulty defining our purpose, we hunger for testimony from one whose walk and experience reflects the courage and strength we need in our faith.&lt;br /&gt;-Elizabeth Lang Arthur&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a phenomenal literature for those seeking a greater understanding of Gods mysteries in the kingdom. It awakened my heart to pray more, and intercede for the nations.&lt;br /&gt;Linda Leverette, House of Hope Ministries&lt;/p&gt;" />
