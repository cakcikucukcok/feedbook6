  <title>The Nigerian Nation and Religion. - Hyacinth Kalu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book, which is the first of a-three-volume series of interfaith relationships in Nigeria, presents Nigeria as a multi-ethnic and multi-religious nation, with religion controlling almost every aspects of life. It highlights the deep-rooted religious divide in Nigeria and looks into various ways that we can move beyond the religious bitterness existing among the three dominant religions in Nigeria: African traditional religion, Islam, and Christianity, and live, work and co-exit peacefully with one another as sisters and brothers. Although this volume begins with the history of Nigeria as nation, its primary interest, and indeed, the interest of the entire series, is not with the politics, economics, and culture of the Nigerian people per se; its primary focus is the religion of the people. Hence, it is a study of African Traditional Religion, Islam, and Christianity in Nigeria. The focus is not the theological and dogmatic principles and faith life of these religions, nor the individual and various sects within these religions; rather these religions are studied from the standpoint of interfaith encounter and relationships, as a requisite for peace, unity and harmony in Nigeria." />
