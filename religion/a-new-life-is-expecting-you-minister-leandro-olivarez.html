  <title>A New Life Is Expecting You - Minister Leandro Olivarez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The year was 1978 in early June. Vivian and Lucia Olivarez had just accepted Jesus Christ to be their Lord and Savior. They had been prophesied too many times that their children would all serve the Lord and that all their children would testify and be ministers of the Word of God. This prophecy has been fulfilled.
Then in early 2009, they were prophesied again for the third time that they would have a son. This son would be the most rebellious of all their children, and he would be used greatly by God. 
My name is Leandro Lenn Olivarez. I am the youngest of five children. I am also the copastor of Templo De Alabanza (Temple of Praise) ministry in Rockport, Texas. Under the direct leadership of Senior Pastor Vivian Olivarez, I have been preaching now for over five years. After growing up in the Lord and backsliding, I have seen the ministry of God change so much that it hurts. I can only imagine how God feels. I have spent the majority of my life running from God, and that very rebellion brought some very bad, evil spirits into my life. I was, at one point of my life, a drug user. I was also a heavy metal drummer and radio DJ, chasing after all the wrong things. My parents, who also happen to be my pastors, never stopped praying for me. This book is to show that your life has a greater purpose and it may have already begun. Submitting to God is the first step.
What you are about to read are real-life testimonies from me and my family. We have seen the mighty hand of God in our family and in the ministry that God has placed before us. You are also going to see Gods hand in-depth on how he worked in our lives and the difference between believing and true faith deep down. At a very young age, I was exposed to the real full power of God, and this very truth rattled my soul to the very core of my inner being. Another thing God showed me is that everyone believes in something, but believing in the unknown and the unseen is a step of faith. Jesus said that all you have to do is believe because if you can start there with your belief, nothing is impossible. I have encountered evil spirits. I have fought them through the name and the blood of Jesus. I have had encounters with demons; and a witch even sat at my dining room table, looked me in the eye, and threatened me to my face. God showed me that true repentance and the name and the blood of Jesus are the only way to break the curses and be set free. 
Please pray to the Lord that he will open your spiritual eyes so that you may see what he wants you to see. There is nothing in this whole world that anyone can say to me to change my mind that God still heals people and sets people free from demonic forces. I am a witness to Gods full power. I have seen with my eyes demons back away at the name of Jesus. I asked the Lord that in the name of Jesus Christ, you will receive a blessing from God while you are reading this book.
All honor and all glory to my savior, Jesus Christ." />
