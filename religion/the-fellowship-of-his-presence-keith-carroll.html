  <title>The Fellowship of His Presence - Keith Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who are we? Why are we here? How do we mature into God&amp;rsquo;s creative intention?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fellowship of His Presence reveals the relational interaction we are invited to have with God. This enlightening book is full of insights that bring clarity to the Gospel message. Keith sheds new light on the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and brings clarity to confusing issues such as how God&amp;rsquo;s expressive voice became a son of man, and how Jesus lived just like us, as a son of man and of God.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ll learn how the transformation of Jesus from a physical presence on earth to a spiritual one enables him to be an ongoing presence with us. You&amp;rsquo;ll see why we don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait for a physical return of Jesus to experience his influencing rule and reign in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Keith shows us how oneness with God is found in our agreement with the Spirit of the Father and Son. You will see that Spirit baptisms are soaking experiences in God&amp;rsquo;s presence and discover what is meant by &amp;ldquo;God with us.&amp;rdquo; Learn how an invented fiction progressively became accepted theology, that antichrist is not a person, and when the biblical &amp;ldquo;last days&amp;rdquo; occured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fellowship of His Presence will answer questions like: Can you actually hear God speak? Is intimacy with the eternal God possible today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This book is written with an amazing depth and understanding.... It is made clear throughout these pages that whether you are a new believer or old, keeping Jesus and our fellowship with him at the forefront of all doctrines and ideals is the most important thing we can do.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;Sandra Querin, JD, MBA, Thd., Pastor, The Revival Center, Clovis, CA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith dedicated his life to our heavenly Father in his pre-teen years. During the teenage years, he became an avid student of the Scriptures. At 29 he married Nancy, and they have three children and five grandchildren. Keith has ministered in a variety of Christian denominations, serving in many capacities including senior pastor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
