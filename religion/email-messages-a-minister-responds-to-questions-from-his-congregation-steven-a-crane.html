  <title>Email &quot;Messages&quot;: A Minister Responds to Questions from His Congregation - Steven A. Crane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="People Want Answers to Their Questions!  Who made God?  Has the Bible been corrupted?  What is the unpardonable sin?  How can a loving God send people to hell? Did Jesus really preach in hell?  As a Bible scholar, church planter, and senior minister of a rapidly growing congregation, Steve Crane receives many questions from believers and skeptics alike. His concise, biblical answers get right to the heart of the matter. Crane not only answers your questions, but will help equip you to give the reason for the hope that you have (I Peter 3:15).  Staying true to the original Email format, questions and answers have been organized into eight separate categories: Questions about God, Questions about Christ, Questions about the Bible, Questions about Salvation, Bible Questions, Bible Difficulties, Questions about End Times, and Objections to Christianity. This format allows readers to choose the issues that are most pertinent to their interests and needs." />
