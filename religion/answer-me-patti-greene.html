  <title>Answer Me - Patti Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Authentic! 
We talk a lot about the importance of prayer, but there is so little emphasis on how to pray. In Answer Me, Patti clearly walks you through various essentials of a vibrant prayer life with a refreshing sense of authenticity and vulnerability. I personally felt convicted and challenged by many of the Daily Thoughts and Prayers. I truly believe all Christians will experience great joy and growth by going through this guide.

Simple and Straight to the Point! 
As an avid reader, an ardent researcher, one could expect Pattis works to showcase complexities of wisdom amassed from her extended spiritual and literary adventures, but this is not the case. Her style is simple and straight to the point. She puts the Word of God in our hands, kick starts us with some down-to-earth thoughts, and lets us dig in to find for ourselves all the treasures reserved in each days devotion to meet our personal needs. This devotional is a product of commitment and consistency that spans decades. May we all find therein, answers that only God can give us.
