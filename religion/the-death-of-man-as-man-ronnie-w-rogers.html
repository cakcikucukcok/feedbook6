  <title>The Death of Man as Man - Ronnie W. Rogers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The content of this book was first presented in its present form at The Oxford Round Table, &lt;i&gt;Religion and Science Shaping the Modern World&lt;/i&gt;, in 2010 at Harris Manchester College, Oxford University, Oxford England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science, or its handmaiden &lt;i&gt;separation of church and state,&lt;/i&gt; is absolutely incapable of establishing or sustaining the liberties spelled out in the Declaration of Independence and protected by the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States was founded upon the astonishing declaration, We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. Then the Constitution was drafted in order to secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is these rights and liberties that are being systematically and surreptitiously dismantled by both the unwarranted expansion of science beyond its legitimate domain and the restricting of religious ideas from public education and policy debate. True science has blessed us, but when employed beyond its legitimate limits of authority, it becomes a dehumanizing tyrant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science has its place in public life, but to limit religious knowledge to merely opinion and private faith, while concurrently limiting all publicly imposable knowledge to what can be demonstrated scientifically, requires more than science can provide. These liberties are based upon belief in the existence of God who created man with intrinsic worth and liberties. Without a public belief in the existence of God, all talk of unalienable rights is quixotic and assures the continuation of the heretofore unabated evanescing of those rights.&lt;/p&gt;" />
