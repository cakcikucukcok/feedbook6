  <title>Come to Think About It - Frank Olsson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Come to Think About It&lt;/i&gt; contains highlights from the books of the Bible. The highlights have been chosen to be the most positive and uplifting passages from the Bible.  They will be useful to all, whether Christians or non-Christians, believers or non-believers. The author has also added a brief essay to each of the Bibles sixty-six books with thoughts and experiences taken from his life.&lt;p&gt;
One of Frank Olssons favorite verses from the Bible is Psalms 90:2 which says: Teach us to ponder how few our days are that we may live each one wisely. The author began his project of reading the Bible from A  Z after he and his wife planned a trip to Jerusalem.  As he read, he lifted out everything that spoke to him, i.e. all the positive pieces, like dance, song, wine, love, etc.,  parts that anyone can relate to regardless of religious affiliation. Once he had those notes he decided to write sixty-six essays, one to each book of the Bible. These are about how we can lead a life of love, generosity and compassion whether we see ourselves as religious or not." />
