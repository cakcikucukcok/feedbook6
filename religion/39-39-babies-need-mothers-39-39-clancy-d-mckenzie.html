  <title>&#39;&#39;Babies Need Mothers&#39;&#39; - Clancy D. McKenzie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Babies Need Mothers  How Mothers Can Prevent Mental Illness in their Children&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is a rare example of careful conceptual reasoning about basic categories in medicine. Ultimately this is what is sorely needed in rational thinking about the mysteries of mental illness. This book is a fascinating contribution and well worth reading, precisely because it upsets the applecart. I recommend it to anyone who wants to get beyond rigid categorization in psychiatry and look at enduring problems of the mind in new ways. &lt;b&gt;Raymond Moody, Author, Life After Life; MD, Psy.D, PhD Philosophy &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dr. McKenzies book is revolutionary. Some long sought answers to causes of psychosis and other severe mental illnesses are explained in clear and understandable language. He not only describes cause and effect, but also provides clear remedies for healing that are unique and long lasting. He shows clearly and unmistakably the way to recover health, and his findings could change the prevailing way of treating chronic mental difficulties. &lt;b&gt;Harold Stern, PhD, Psychoanalyst &lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book is a further development of ideas described in Delayed Posttraumatic Stress Disorders from Infancy: The Two Trauma Mechanism by Clancy D. McKenzie, MD and Lance S. Wright, MD. I have used this latter book in my courses at Georgetown University, in courses on the family and courses on philosophy of psychoanalysis. The ideas of the book were enlightening, stimulative and provocative. I plan to continue to use the ideas of Dr. McKenzie in my classes. In his new book Dr. McKenzie makes recommendations about child rearing practices. His new book is rich in ideas and promises a fruitful debate about the psychological origins of mental illness. No one will regret reading this book. &lt;b&gt;Wilfried Ver Eecke Professor in Philosophy Adjunct Professor in Psychology Georgetown University &lt;/b&gt;" />
