  <title>You Are Not Dust - Adolphus Uzoamaka Cyprian</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You cannot exercise authority of the believer without being a fire, so for you to have dominion over Satan and his agents, you must become fire for Christ.
God did not create any man to be dust. What the Bible said is that God created man out of dust and not with dust. The statement Dust you are, dust you shall return is the curse God placed on man for disobedience. The Bible said that God is fire, therefore, he created man to be fire like him.
When he made man (Adam), he placed him in a garden surrounded by waters, and he often comes to fellowship with the man he created, until the man sinned. God took away his protection.
God then placed the curse of being dust on man. He (God) sent his son (Jesus) to come and restore that relationship, which is the attribute of fire in man that made man an image of God, which is the Holy Ghost. So today, accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior. Become fire, which is the original state of man from beginning, or reject him (Jesus Christ) and remain as dust, which is food for Satan." />
