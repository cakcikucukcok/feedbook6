  <title>Paul and Money - Verlyn Verbrugge, Keith R. Krell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The apostle Paul, one of the most prominent figures in the early Jesus movement, had a lot to say about money. His letters deal with real people as they lived their Christian lives in the Greco-Roman world. He finds it necessary to address &amp;ldquo;those who are rich in this present world&amp;rdquo; (1 Tim 6:17). But he also has to address those do not want to work, for whatever reason, and are &amp;ldquo;idle and disruptive&amp;rdquo; (2 Thess 3:6). Moreover, whereas most churches today have a certain socio-economic homogeneity, some of Paul&amp;rsquo;s churches had a combination of upper class wealthy people and lower class slaves worshiping side-by-side, and it inevitably created friction (esp. 1 Cor 11:17&amp;ndash;34).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the past twenty years a significant amount of research has been done on class-consciousness in the Greco-Roman world and on the significance of Paul&amp;rsquo;s fund-raising venture &amp;ldquo;for the poor among the Lord&amp;rsquo;s people in Jerusalem&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;&amp;ldquo;the collection&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;for his ministry. Relying on the surprising results of current Pauline scholarship and a careful exegesis of a variety of New Testament texts, this book offers a thorough investigation of the apostle Paul&amp;rsquo;s sayings and dealings with money.&lt;/p&gt;" />
