  <title>Forsaken Fellowship - Amanda Maree Wilson Hagerman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amandas journey has been filled with good times and bad, but is not without purpose. In her own words, she says, &quot;Sometimes we feel we are walking down a meaningless pathway to nowhere, but in all truth that is just the version of our lifes story Satan wants us to see. Satan doesn&#39;t want us to understand that every obstacle presented is able to be overcome; if we could just reach beyond the insecurities, and the atmosphere of fear, doubt, and negativity to embrace God&#39;s infinite truth that was graphed into our lives before we were conceived.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;I know the thoughts that I think toward you, said the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end.&quot; But Satans purpose is to divert that good God-given purpose that God intended for our lives toward that of utter destruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;God knows the thoughts that he thinks toward us, but do we? Do we realize it isn&#39;t God&#39;s will that anyone perish but that all come to repentance? Yet, God&#39;s not going to overrun our will, so God says, &quot;Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I WILL give you rest.&quot; Amanda has come to realize that being a Christian is a bed of roses, because even something as fragile as a rose has the ability to inflict pain. Amandas journey hasn&#39;t been one of ease, but it has all brought her closer to one thing, love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
