  <title>Strengthen Your Brothers: Letters of Encouragement from an Archbishop to His Priests - J. Peter Sartain, Francis George</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;P&gt;As Cardinal George aptly states, &amp;quot;This book is an invitation to trust, made by an archbishop who loves his priests.&amp;quot;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;In recent years, Archbishop Peter Sartain has written to the priests of the Diocese of Joliet (where he served from 2006-10) and the priests of the Archdiocese of Seattle (where he currently ministers). These intimate, thoughtful letters of encouragement and support are collected here. From a place of commitment and care, Archbishop Sartain addresses a variety of spiritual, theological, pastoral, and personal situations that challenge priests. His personal experience and spiritual insights come together in a moving pastoral way, offering the reader a deep sense of God&amp;#39;s care for the world and those who shepherd his people.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Archbishop Sartain&amp;#39;s confidence that God is in charge and ministry is based on surrendering control to God&amp;#39;s truth, love, and simple presence permeates this book. Priests will find it uplifting, as will others who serve in ministry, and the people who care about them.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
