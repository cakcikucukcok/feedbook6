  <title>He Is - Troy, Susie Conner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 2005, while I was taking a shower, God gave me the idea to research the Bible and find all the Scriptures describing the names of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. This was not some idea I came up with; I believe that this was inspired by the mind of God. This idea was not mine but His! Truly, I am not the author because the Scriptures used in He Is are from the inspired Word of God.  I read the entire Bible three times, wherein I found over 1,400 verses for this offering. Although we have spent hundreds of hours on research, God must receive all the glory and honor of this accredited work. I believe those who may never pick up a Bible will be able to become better acquainted with the Lord Jesus Christ through this reading.  Exodus 3:1314: And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? And God said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you.  This verse is used to identify God as The Great I Am, and truly He is the Great I Am! However, the emphasis should be on the word that because God in His entire splendor cannot be described with just HE ISI AM!&lt;/p&gt;" />
