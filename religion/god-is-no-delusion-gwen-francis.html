  <title>God Is No Delusion - Gwen Francis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This story begins with the charismatic movement within the Christian church in the 1970s. Author Gwen Francis saw herself as only an observer at a Life in the Spirit seminar at an Anglican Church in New Zealand in 1975. Her subsequent experience of the Blessing of the Holy Spirit and various unasked-for gifts resulted in her admission to a psychiatric hospital. At the time, she was certain she was obeying God in all she said and did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;God is No Delusion&lt;/i&gt;, she explains the God she has known all of her life, and she discusses the force of evil that tries to separate us and help us destroy ourselves. Blending her life story and personal stories with her spiritual experiences, Francis offers evidence of a spiritual force she believes has communicated with humans and the living world since their beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geared toward Christians who find it difficult to accept all the traditional teachings of their church and for the wandering flock who are looking for some spiritual guidance in a modern world, &lt;i&gt;God is No Delusion&lt;/i&gt; shares both a message from God and a warning about the forces of evil. &lt;/p&gt;" />
