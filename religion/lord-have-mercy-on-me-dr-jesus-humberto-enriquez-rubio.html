  <title>Lord...Have Mercy on Me - Dr.Jesus Humberto Enriquez Rubio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is Book No. 3, as well as the last book in the collection untitled WHAT IS THERE BETWEEN GOD AND MAN
This series represents the fifty years of my life I dedicated to search and investigate literature in order to find everything I could about God and his relationship with man. Throughout these years, I worked with an open mind, putting aside all paradigms and biases, and I discovered very interesting things that led me to a number of conclusions that were surprising even for me.
I found out, for instance, that Jesus Christ is the result of a legend created by Saul of Tarsus (Saint Paul) almost three hundred years before Emperor Constantine I (the Great) adopted Christianity as the official religion of the Roman Empire. I also learned that the divinity of Jesus Christ was agreed upon at the Council of Nicaea in the year 325 A.D., being promoted and agreed to by the emperor. Christianity became the property of the empire and one hundred years afterwards, the Roman Empire became property of the Catholic Church, with the pope as leader. The pope performs the functions of Roman Emperor to this date. 
I also discovered that the church worships three gods: Jesus Christ, who is a legend in itself; Jehovah, because the whole Bible is a book that talks about him and his relationship with Judaism; and God, the almighty father. Christianity confuses and mixes these three gods.
I also found out that the act of consecration during mass represents the sacrifice and dismembering of Jesus Christ as an offering to Jehovah, and that all Catholics are happy with this crime because Jesus Christ, upon being sacrificed, gets rid of all the sins committed by everyone present. The assembly finishes by eating his flesh and drinking his blood, similar to a voodoo ceremony or to an act of cannibalism.
There are many other things you should take the time to consider." />
