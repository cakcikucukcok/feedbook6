  <title>Journey Toward Christ Centered Emotions - Lonnie Phillips</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Every emotion you and I can think of such as; joy/excitement, sorrow, fear, anger and pleasure all have the element of the divine in them because God, who is Spirit, has all these emotions as well.  Our emotions are not only an important aspect of our soul but is also vital in our relationship with God, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.  Our emotions allow us to live life in abundance which Christ Jesus came to give us.(John 10:10)  
Now, for all of you who are thinking this guy is completely post-modern and is all about feelings, let me try to put your mind at ease.  I am not speaking of being overly emotional or basing truth on emotion but I am saying that we who are made in Gods image will never enjoy the kind of communion God intends us to have with Him unless our emotions are a part of that relationship with Him.  Our emotional and mental well being is vital to our relationship with Jesus." />
