  <title>The One Who Is - Dr. Kenny Rhodes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a comprehensive and concise treatment of the philosophical, theological and biblical issues related to the doctrine of God. Within its pages the nature, existence, and tri-unity of God are presented in an understandable and clear manner. The authors objective was to hold in highest regard the text of Holy Scripture while reflecting the biblical position of the historic orthodox faith. The books tone is polemic and passionate, sincere and scholarly with a commitment to communicate the truth of Gods Word with simplicity and profundity. Also, between its covers, you will find a wealth of information with numerous references and explanatory notes for clarification and further personal study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; The book is arranged around the concept of the term logos which suffixes many other words and turns them into fields of study, as in the phrase theology (Theos-logos). The term Logos refers to the concepts of epistemology, ontology, and hermeneutics. Applied to the doctrine of God, its organization deals with Knowing God, the Being of God, and Communicating God. This corresponds to Thomas Aquinass approach to understanding God, in the questions: what is God (we define God by negation, what He is not); how do we know God (we know him by His effects); how do you communicate or explain God (God is communicated to us by His names, that is, His attributes). The book, furthermore, presents a classic and newly reworked argument for the existence of God called the Existential Argument, which is based on the notion of being.&lt;/p&gt;" />
