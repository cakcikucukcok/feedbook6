  <title>Martin Luther&#39;s Theology: It&#39;s Historical and Systematic Development - Bernhard Lohse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;This definitive analysis of the theology of Martin Luther surveys its development during the crises of Luther&amp;#39;s life, then offers a systematic survey by topics. Containing a wealth of quotations from less-known writings by Luther and written in a way that will interest both scholar and novice, Lohse&amp;#39;s magisterial volume is the first to evaluate Luther&amp;#39;s theology in both ways. Lohse&amp;#39;s historical analysis takes up Luther&amp;#39;s early exegetical works and then his debates with traditions important to him in the context of the various controversies leading up to his dispute with the Antinomians. The systematic treatment shows how the meaning of ancient Christian doctrines took their place within the central teaching of justification by faith.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
