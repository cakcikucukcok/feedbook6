  <title>High on the Mountain - B. V. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;High on the Mountain is a prophetic and historical documentation of the Jewish people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four thousand years ago, the Jewish people were in an area which would, two thousand years later, be named by the Romans as Palestinia. God made a covenant with Abraham and his descendants that the land would be theirs forever. Prophecy stated that the Jewish descendants would go into captivity. Four hundred fifty years later they were led from their Egyptian captivity and occupied the land of their fathers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High on the mountain of Moriah was a city called Jerusalem, which would become their capital city under David. There was also a thirty-five-acre plot of land that had been dedicated as the Temple Mount and would become known to the world as the holiest plot of land in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jewish people and their beloved city would survive until 587 BC, when they were taken into captivity by the Babylonians. They would return to the land that they considered their homeland. They were almost completely destroyed by the Romans in AD 70 and would be scattered throughout the world. The land became a desolation and unproductivejust as prophecy had stated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although they have been subjected to a multitude of attacks, cruelties, persecutions, and deaths by the millions, they would again return to their beloved land and become the Nation of Israel. They would reclaim their capital city of Jerusalem and the Temple Mount. A land that was said to be dead forever would again flourish and become productive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was this land so important? What is their claim to the land? Who actually owns the land? How could a land become productive again and better than before? What has the prophetic word of God said about this land and these people? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High on the Mountain will address all these questions and much more.&lt;/p&gt;" />
