  <title>Denton Family Diary - Sarah Denton Baun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sarah Ellen Denton Baun (nee Byrd) lives in Nashville, Tennessee, with her husband, Glenn Baun, a retired Nazarene pastor. She has long visualized this project, although she felt somewhat intimidated by the sheer volume. Sarah has enriched these memoirs considerably by drawing from her sharp memory, having a remarkable recollection of events, places and people.
You hold the result in your hands: a tender, touching and true story of one brave family, the Dentons, and their work in various countries bringing the Gospel to people and making their lives better, spanning the mid-forties to 1970. Through trials and tribulations, good times and much joy, the family is still bound together by the indelible imprint of their long-ago and far-away experiences. Ron Denton is sorely missed, but they can each feel his presence still in different ways -sometimes a phrase he used often, a twisting of the mouth when pulling a prank, or the bite of pepper and vinegar which he so loved.
Sarah has traveled a long and diverse path in the course of her life, and is faithful to the Lord and the Church she so loves. 
Her children and grandchildren will be forever grateful for this undertaking, a veritable task of love, nearly two years in the making." />
