  <title>The Evolution of Man - Paty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the ark of Noah (the boat that floated on top of the water when the first world was destroyed).
This book is calling for a religious debate to review the understandings about the ark and the beginning of our world system. 
The Bible story about the ark is true, but the interpretation about the ark is faulty. 
When you see the ark, you know that everything of which this object is composed resembles our modern life. It looks like a cabin. It looks like nails or glue was used to fasten the wood together. It looks like Noah knew about the invention of axes or cutlasses and hammers.
So if Noah knew of these inventions, then why did early men start this world with nothing? They lived in caves and roamed the earth, using bare hands to strangle animals so they could eat the flesh.
This book will introduce you to the things surrounding this ark. It will offer the wisdom of the Great Jehovah. This wisdom never has been understood, from the beginning until now.
