  <title>Mentoring Wisdom: Living and Leading Well - Carson Pue, Doug Birdsall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Are you called upon to give wisdom and direction, inspiration and hope, vision and paths of execution - sometimes with little notice? Leaders get this all the time - and being a leader at home, at church or in an organization - is not easy. So where does one access the resources to make decisions and to lead? If you desire to be better prepared the next time you feel discouraged...by leadership indecision; by hardships of your role pressing in on you; or by waning enthusiasm about being a leader... Mentoring Wisdom could be the encouragement you need. Carson Pue knows - perhaps better than anyone - that &#39;two people shorten the road&#39; and sometimes you just need a word of wisdom. This mentor, seasoned by experience, shares a collection of spiritually insightful thoughts. With gripping honesty these practical nuggets are delivered as if you are sitting across the desk from a trusted friend. Included with each is a scriptural verse pointing towards faith and God&#39;s promise to walk with you through each day. For each topic, Carson hones in on leadership values while providing tested practices learned through his lifework developing servant leaders. Woven into each section is a prayer that can be used to guide a leader&#39;s own prayers into their situation. Every page invites God to speak to the reader and enjoy the peace of His presence." />
