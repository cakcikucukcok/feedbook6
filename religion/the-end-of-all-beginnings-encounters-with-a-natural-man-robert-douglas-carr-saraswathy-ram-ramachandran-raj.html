  <title>The End of All Beginnings: Encounters with a Natural Man - ROBERT DOUGLAS CARR, SARASWATHY RAM, RAMACHANDRAN RAJ</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This Book is about a &quot;Natural Man&quot; who at the age of 49 went through a profound  physical catalysis, physiological, atomic explosion as he calls it, that left him miraculously cleansed of all over-imposition of thought and culture. Since then this &quot;Natural Man&quot;, affectionately called UG has lobbed cynical grenades on every citadel of authority and convention. For him there are no teachers, no gurus, no religion, no striving, no solace, no redemption. He is the ultimate Non-Guru, a kind of Cosmic Naxalite who ruthlessly demystified spiritualism, but claimed he has no panacea to offer. For a person who says he has no questions and no answers to give, it is surprisingly easy to talk to him and it is a privilege to introduce this book - THE END OF ALL BEGINNINGS." />
