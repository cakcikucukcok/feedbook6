  <title>The Galactic Structure of Jesus the Christ - Aden John</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whatever might have possibly existed in times past, whatever might have been said and done in times past, wherever that might have been, as long as it happened on this same singular universe, there remains a record of all those activities. And certainly, there is an archive wherein all those details are regularly been kept.
Even as you, the reader, reads and even as I, the writer, writes before you can read, just as we understand the purpose of a video recording, there is an immaterial but automatic instant storing system in the spiritual. Spiritually, those records are stored somewhere in the universewithin the galactic masses. As the Christ is all and in all, it follows that all these huge volumes of data are archived inside the galactic structure of the Christ. In addition to these historical archives, there are also records of future events as well, and they remain accessible.
Beautifully, anyone and everyone so privileged by God Almighty can have access to these data and see them in real time modebut only spiritually and not physically. Sadly, as these data are spiritual and the entity of Satan, who is a spirit, is still resident within time, he and his demonic cohorts equally can access (actually crack and hack into) these huge tons of data at will.
By the spiritual nature of the fallen man, his spirit no longer has direct accesses to these data bank, and so he needs a spiritual guide to lead him all the way. On Gods part, He leads the spirits of men (through unique dreams, daytime trances, visions, the spirit of prophecy, etc.) all at his own will. But on the part of Satan who is the hacking spirit, he can lead the spirits of men both at his own will and at the will of the restless man. As expected, with the illegal methods of Satan (whether by spiritism, mediums, crystal balls, channeling arts, telepathy, projections, and meditations, diabolism), there are bound to be troubles as there is a penalty for erring and gross misconducts. And irrespective of the privilege of such knowing, that power to bring about any good and positive result remains absent.
Honorably, in Christ Jesus, whoever is privileged to have a look into these data at Gods will remains blessed and also gains that power to bring about every positive results and or changes.
Now we must know the in and out of all thingswe must find the Truth and so get to understand that everything is all contained in Jesus, the Christ.
