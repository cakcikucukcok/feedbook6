      <meta name="description" content="Are you tired of mediocrity, average, the status quo, the norm, or the usual? If you are, then you are primed for your next level. However, after you are primed for the next level, you need to make yourself ready for the next level. 
God did not create anybody a loser or failure. God is too good to do that. God created all of us winners. Everybody can win and everybody can live a winning life, and constantly too. There is a winner inside you. You are born to win, but to win, you must know how to win. You can be everything that God wants you to be and do everything that He wants you to do if you know how. There is a winner in you, but you need to release him or her for the benefit of your world and to the glory of God. The book Unleashed unfolds time-tested principles from the infallible and unfailing Word of God on how you can unleash the winner in you." />
