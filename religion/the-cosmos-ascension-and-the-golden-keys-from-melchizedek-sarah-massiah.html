  <title>The Cosmos, Ascension and the Golden Keys from Melchizedek - Sarah Massiah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a must read for those who question the mystery that is called &amp;lsquo;life&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A book to ignite a remembrance of your true soul essence, and the roles and stories that all have played throughout many incarnational experiences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is dedicated to you: the reader who wishes to understand why certain areas of your life&amp;rsquo;s journey have not played out, as you indeed intended.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A book that offers a differing way to heal to many and gift and insights to those awakening to whom they truly are. A way of living without the fears and restrictions of the past.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This ditty intends to draw you in, into a way of living, free from the need to reach for the gin. This book intends to bring you joy, in the knowing that stories that made you cry, can be transformed in a blink of an eye. So delve into the text within, that may resonate with you and make you grin. If you read inside, we can assure you of an&amp;nbsp;awakening far beyond what you presently feel is real. Besides, it may make you walk with glee in your stride.&lt;br /&gt;
A book that discusses ascension and &amp;lsquo;The Rise Back to Creator&amp;rsquo;s Love Light&amp;rsquo; which many strive to find. An overview of the cosmos. A guide and an exploration into the depths of emotions and the responses that hold humankind back. This is a journey that will not only touch your heart but your mind and soul.&lt;/p&gt;" />
