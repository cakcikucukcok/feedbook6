  <title>Spiritual Realism: Overcoming the Dogmas of Fear and Guilt - Ehab Fattal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The mind is the source of it all. Balance your mind and you will balance your life. Most of your imbalances are the result of beliefs that do not belong to you. You have either inherited them through birth or acquired them through teachings of others.  Your spiritual integrity is compromised since you are not standing in your own truth. It is all others whom you have trusted from your parents to your religious and political leaders who have constructed the matrix in which you live. Your real authentic matrix is fear, prejudice and worry free. To return to that, you will need to overcome the illusions that others have built for you.  Your true matrix is divinity. You are the great divine creator who has come here to help expand the infinite universe. You are here to create and enjoy this great game of life. Suffering is a choice and you have the free will to always choose differently no matter what the circumstance. All that you need is within you. You are much more powerful than you ever imagined." />
