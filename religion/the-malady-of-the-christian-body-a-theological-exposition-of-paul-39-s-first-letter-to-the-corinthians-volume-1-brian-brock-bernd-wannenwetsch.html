  <title>The Malady of the Christian Body: A Theological Exposition of Paul&#39;s First Letter to the Corinthians, Volume 1 - Brian Brock, Bernd Wannenwetsch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The ailments of the contemporary church are remarkably similar to those suffered by the fractious Corinthian church in the first century. This is the challenge presented in The Malady of the Christian Body, a two-volume commentary by Brian Brock and Bernd Wannenwetsch.  The manner in which Paul engages questions of factionalism, sexuality, legal conflict, idolatry, dress codes, and eating habits reveals that neither the malady he diagnoses nor the therapy he offers track the dominant accounts currently on offer of the malaise suffered by today&#39;s church. This volume depicts the Apostle as carefully examining the organic whole that is the body of Christ in order to detect obstacles to the healthy flow of powers that sustain its life. The therapy that is then offered comes by way of a redirection of the Corinthian believers&#39; attention to the ways in which they can embrace God&#39;s active working among them to heal their broken unity.  This book breaks new ground in crossing and reconfiguring the traditional disciplinary boundaries between biblical studies, systematic theology, and theological ethics." />
