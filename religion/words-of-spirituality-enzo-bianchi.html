These &#39;words&#39; of Fr Bianchi are not listed alphabetically or by theme. Rather they are arranged to take us on a journey. Through the use of a method of allusions and cross-references, one term evokes another, explains it in part, and sets aside some elements of its definition to be taken up further on. At the heart of the book is the conviction that our life has meaning: it is not our task to invent or determine that meaning, but simply to discover it - present and active - in and around us." />
