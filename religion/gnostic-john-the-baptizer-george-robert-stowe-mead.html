  <title>Gnostic John the Baptizer - George Robert Stowe Mead</title>
      <meta name="description" content="George Robert Stowe Mead was an author, editor, translator, and an influential member of the Theosophical Society as well as the founder of the Quest Society.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The main materials contained in &amp;quot;Gnostic John the Baptizer&amp;quot; will certainly be new for the vast majority of readers. Moreover the Mand&amp;aelig;an narratives, legends and discourses are not only interesting because of their own distinctive matter and manner, but they are also arresting; for they raise a number of problems, some of which are far-reaching and one is fraught with implications of immense importance. The definite solutions of these problems, however, lie in the future, and the most important of them will perhaps never be reached; for, in the absence of straightforward historical information, general agreement on any subject that concerns Christian origins immediately or even indirectly is now well-nigh a psychological impossibility.&lt;br /&gt;
The writer&amp;#39;s intention in publishing these selections is not to speculate about the problems, for we are not yet in a position to state them with sufficient accuracy, but the very modest undertaking of making accessible for English readers some specimens of narrative and doctrine from one collection only of the traditional gnostic material which the Mand&amp;aelig;an scribes have preserved to our own day through centuries of copying, and which hands on an early literature purporting at least in part to go back to times contemporaneous with Christian origins." />
