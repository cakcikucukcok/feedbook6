  <title>Right Now - David Levister</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Did the cross of Calvary truly remove every form of the curse? Did Jesus really make everything right for those who put their trust in Him? Or do we await another day when God will add to the work of the cross in order to complete our salvation? The truth contained in this treatise is the simplest of all truths. This book is not a study on the mysterious depths of the gospel, but rather, on the foundational principles upon which the church is to be built. Although foundational, the truth contained herein is one in which the church at large is unfamiliar. Though simple, this truth is simply profound and contains power to bring forth a new and radical perspective. This new perspective contains the ability to connect the believer to supernatural possibilities. This radical perspective of which I speak is a simple and honest look at the redemptive work of the cross. Could it be that Jesus&#39; death, resurrection, and seating at the Fathers right hand has totally and completely rectified the human condition? Is it possible that as believers, we can experience and enjoy the bountiful and unlimited blessings of heaven by merely agreeing with what the Father has already accomplished through His Son? It has often been said that every believer has a right to be blessed, healed, favored, etc. The truth is, we have far more than a mere right to these blessings. We have Jesus&#39; Right which guarantees that these blessings are not only ours, but they are irrevocably ours. Because of the redemptive work of Calvary, every believer is as much in the right with the Father as Jesus Himself. 
The moment we believe in Jesus, His righteousness is accredited to our account! Thus, Jesus&#39; Right is NOW upon us! Truly, there has been a great exchange . . . He has taken all of our wrong and given us all of His RIGHT." />
