If you are one of thousands of Christians who can answer yes to those questions, Beyond the Dream was written for you. Discovering the dream that God has for you is an amazing experience, but when He doesnt bring that dream to fruition in the way you want it toor as quickly as you want it todespair, disillusionment, or desperation can set in. But Gods Word gives the encouragement you need to make it through this season in your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the Dream is a down-to-earth, Old Testament character study of Josepha man who had big dreams but had to endure hardships, and experienced some twists and turns in the road before God brought those dreams to fruition. Ed Johnson III draws out four simple lessons from the life of Joseph to help you see what God desires of you in the time of transition from dream to reality.&lt;/p&gt;" />
