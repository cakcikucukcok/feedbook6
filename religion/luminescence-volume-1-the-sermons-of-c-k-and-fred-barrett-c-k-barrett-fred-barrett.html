  <title>Luminescence, Volume 1: The Sermons of C. K. and Fred Barrett - C. K. Barrett, Fred Barrett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What is found in this series unveils an entirely different side of C. K. Barrett, a side one might never have known about if one had knowledge only of his famous commentaries and monographs. Herein lies a goodly selection of Kingsley&#39;s sermons preached largely in small- and medium-sized Methodist churches in the northeast of England, though often elsewhere in England and around the world.   Fred Barrett was not the scholar his son was, but on close inspection, one can most definitely see the impact of the father on the son when it came to preaching. It seems right to include as many sermons from both of these men as we can in this series. One thing sorely lacking in much preaching these days is in-depth engagement with both the biblical text and one&#39;s tradition and theology. The sermons in these volumes demonstrate what such preaching can look like. This first volume presents 100 sermons on the Gospels and Acts." />
