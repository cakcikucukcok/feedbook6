  <title>Life Never Dies - Roy Melvyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout many centuries, religion and philosophy have sought to rescue man from his ego; both have failed. The last thousand years of acquired knowledge has made man neither more peaceful nor happier. Our energies must be redirected away from acquiring more knowledge regarding the world and inquiring into why all our knowledge has failed us. Only then can man begin to understand that the solution does not reside outside. The solution is not exoteric, but instead esoteric. The intellect seeks to make the unknown knowable. Memory, is the storage of the known. It is re-cognition, knowing again. However, where the intellect fails is in its attempts to know the Unknowable.  When the intellect is exhausted, there is the opportunity for deeper sight. What is our exact relation to the Conscious Life Energy that pervades the phenomenal existence?" />
