  <title>Christianity in America: Triumph and Tragedy - G. Wright Doyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Was America founded as a Christian nation? What role has the Christian faith of many of its leaders played in the course of its history? How has Christianity affected American culture and society?  This trenchant critique of the role of Christianity in American history highlights both the ways in which Christians have made many valuable contributions as salt and light, and how they have caused a great deal of damage by trying to be savior and lord.  Believers in Christ have built one of the most Christianized countries in the world, with benefits for millions. They have also nurtured messianic aspirations that have spawned disasters for themselves and other countries. Generous in praise for dedicated believers who have reflected the character of Christ, the book is also unsparing in criticism of Christians who have, sometimes with the best intentions, failed to act wisely.  In short, the reader will be encouraged by the many triumphs of Christianity in America, and sobered by its tragedy." />
