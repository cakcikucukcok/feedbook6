  <title>The Newness of Life - Stanley B. Mathurin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dear Readers, you have authority over the 							powers of darkness that you have not yet unfolded 						and apprehended for yourself and therefore are 							not using.			   											Well, not too long ago I discovered this truth 						for myself, so don&#39;t feel bad.  As I searched the  							scriptures, I became cognizant of the power that I 							possess in Christ Jesus, our Lord and Savior.  I had 							been defeated countless 	times, using the wrong 							means to try to overcome my defeats.  I was being 						tossed to and fro by the enemy of my soul.  It took 						me a long time to learn and acknowledge who I am 						and my purpose for being here on earth, but thanks 						be to God, He has given me the victory through 							Christ Jesus. 		
	In this book you will discover that no matter what you used to be, God can bring you back to where you should be in Christ Jesus, the Messiah, and use you for HIs glory in a mighty way.  Like the Apostle Paul, no matter what your past life story has to tell or what sins you committed, your slate becomes completely clean when you come to know Jesus.  Yes!  You are made entirely brand new.  God sees you just as if you had never sinned at all.  Before he was named Paul, Saul was a persecutor of those who believed in Jesus as Messiah.  One day, he experienced a miraculous conversion while on a road trip to Damascus to persecute some believers, as recorded in Acts 9:3, which transformed him into a man and his life into a ministry on fire for the Lord, because of God&#39;s grace and mercy towards him.  
	You, too, can be transformed and begin walking in The Newness of Life and serving Him in the newness of the Holy Spirit.  1 Samuel 14:6 assures us that &quot;... nothing restrains the LORD from saving by many or by few.&quot;" />

    	<p>Dear Readers, you have authority over the powers of darkness that you have not yet unfolded and apprehended for yourself and therefore are not using.
