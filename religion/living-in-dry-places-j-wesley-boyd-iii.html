So what he will do is allow our brooks to run dry in order to refocus our attention back toward Him. He did for Abraham when he required the very life of his son Isaac; He did it for Moses, after he murdered an Egyptian and had to flee for his lifehiding on the backside of a mountain. He did it for David, just after he was anointed king and he finds himself on the run from King Saul and ends up hiding in a cave in Adullam with a few hundred dysfunctional potential giant killers. He did it for the prophet Elijah, as he was escorted by God Himself eastward to Cherith where he would be provided for with flesh and water from the brook only to have thebrook run dry. And Hes done the same for me, so walk with me if you will on this journey as we discover and unfold how to handle our seasons of drought.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;" />
