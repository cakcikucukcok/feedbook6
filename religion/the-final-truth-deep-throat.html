  <title>The Final Truth - Deep Throat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;This book reveals the truth for the first time about some of the most sought after information for generations. If you are interested in the unknown and want information, or religious and waiting for answers, the most holy of all information is made public by the well known household name representing truth amidst secrecy. A book can not offer tangible proof, but because I am a scientist and worked on many aspects of these revelations, perhaps it may convince you as I am convinced. This book tries to explain the high respect the government has for the laws of the nation and its citizens, but at the same time why it has another unique responsibility to preserve and protect infinite life. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This book explains how the storyteller has been made by the story itself. There is not any part of the story, which is normally believable, but I lived it, and you lived through some of it as well. Watergate did happen. I explain how I found out the truth, and why I have come to my conclusions. Instead of trying to fight the truth as so many others have done before me, being a scientist the most statistically probable answers are arrived at.  Then the proof offered me personally through delegated authority is explained to you.&lt;/P&gt;" />
