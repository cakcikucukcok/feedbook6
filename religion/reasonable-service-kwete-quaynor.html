  <title>Reasonable Service - Kwete Quaynor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many of our praise and worship services have been reduced to mere social gatherings. Several people now visit various Houses of God and yet never get to access the very Presence of God. Unfortunately, in several other settings, praise and worship have been reduced to ordinary prologues to other sessions within
gatherings or sheer stopgaps in the event of some delays and challenges.
It is about time we worshipped God in Spirit and in Truth by doing the right things in order to attract His pleasure and blessings rather than His wrath and curses, which we so often
do when we dishonor Him. How many times have we not deliberately or mechanically offered abominable sacrifi ces to God?
We sometimes inadvertently burn strange incense before God and feel our sacrifi ces must be acceptable simply on account of
their quantum or quality, but if God could Himself, acknowledge that the praise songs of His people were harmonious, and that
their sacrifi ces were fat, and their services solemn and yet reject them all, then what we render to God must certainly transcend our nominal readings on our man-made, selfgratifying
gauges and emotional feelings.
We must guard against neglecting our call to do the right things as regards the praise and worship we offer to God, for the consequences thereof could be dire.
Reasonable Service  a ration of my passion does not provide formulae for praising and worshipping God, but rather provides a unique revelation and understanding of the subject in a bid to enhance our intelligible service to God. Hold yourself in readiness for an exceptional biblical voyage through the prestigious ministry of praise and worship." />
