  <title>Discovering His Image - Jennefer Payne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An identity crisis has wrought confusion and chaos in the land. A mixture of message and lack of authenticity has bound and scattered the flock with fear and condemnation. The judges and leaders have become corrupt as each man follows his own way. It is from within this darkness that the Lords light will shine, bringing the order and justice in His Standard to establish His righteousness.
This book of poems will illuminate Gods Image of you as the only truth, uplifting you and revealing the surety of His intention in your life. Use it as a tool to inspire your meditation and prayer time with the Lord, and watch how simple and effective the gift of the faith of Christ can be.
As He reveals where you are, what you already have in Him, why He has hidden it from you in the past, and how it affects you now, the substance of your identity will become authenticated. This discovery releases the fullness of joy and the presence of peace you have been looking for. Rivers of living water, divine potential, fullness unlocked, and life abundant is revealed inside the seed of God. He is your breath, He is your life, He is your strength, and He is your Source! We are created in the substance of His Image and the likeness of His form; Christ in you the hope of glory.
The Joy of Christ
Can you smell the fragrance in your nose?
Can you feel the wind as the Spirit flows?
Rejoicing with each other in a praise-filled song,
As we walk together in this journey we are on.
Far more sweet than the sweetest rose,
That is the joy of Christ upon your clothes.
The light of His pure truth shining in the dark
Makes the brightest light of hope from a tiny spark.
Creation on your lips and life flowing from your heart,
Playing out this dream of His which He had from the start.
What garden do you see, my friend, one thats parched and bare?
Or will you awaken to the Spirit and find it laden there?
Healing in your wings and prayers upon your lips;
A fragrant oil rises and from your body drips.
Your face is lit with fire; your robes are white as snow.
The mindset of the Son is what youll come to know." />
