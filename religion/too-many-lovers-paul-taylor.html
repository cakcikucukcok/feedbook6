  <title>Too Many Lovers - Paul Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Me?  Have a problem with idols?  Youve got to be kidding!  Thats just something that was practiced by people in ancient religions who werent as well educated as we are todayright?
If this was your first thought, you couldnt be more wrong!  The problem of idols and idolatry is not an outdated practice of extinct religions; its actually alive and flourishing today in our modern society.  True, our current idols arent typically made of wood, stone, or gold.  Thats because idolatry is simply the act of loving and worshipping something or someone more than the one person who actually deserves it  God Himself.  So by this definition, we can turn anything or anyone into our personal idol and we will suffer for it!   Most people, even Christians, who practice idolatry arent even aware of it, but here they are suffering spiritually, emotionally, and even physically but cant seem to connect the dots between misery and the practice of idolatry.
This study guide was developed to help people find out if idolatry is a bigger problem than you realized.  It was put together to help you - and maybe a group of your friends - get real and get honest with each other and with God.   This guide was designed to complement the book, Too Many Lovers and to go deeper into Gods truth together.  Its an opportunity to discover the freedom youve only dreamed of!   This study guide is packed with information, examples, challenging questions, practical steps, and personal application to move you from bondage into personal healing!" />
