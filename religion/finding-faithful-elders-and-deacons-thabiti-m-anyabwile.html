  <title>Finding Faithful Elders and Deacons - Thabiti M. Anyabwile</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Any church leader knows the qualifications for elders and deacons are articulated in the Bible, but that same leader also knows that actually &lt;em&gt;finding&lt;/em&gt; other leaders who fulfill the biblical qualifications is difficult. While many books analyze and debate the finer points of church government, few have been written on both elders and deacons, and fewer still successfully show how to identify and reproduce legitimate leaders and willing servants throughout the ranks of the church body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thabiti Anyabwile writes from his expertise as a pastor and an elder as well as from his experience of being led by faithful men&amp;mdash;men who saw in him the fundamental qualities listed in Scripture and invested their time, energy, and love into grooming him to take their place. Balancing thoughtful analysis of pertinent passages with thorough application for practical use in a contemporary context, Anyabwile answers the questions, &amp;ldquo;Who should we look for to lead and serve in the church?&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;What should they do to fulfill their calling?&amp;rdquo; Most helpful, perhaps, are the lists &amp;ldquo;Observations to make&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Questions to ask,&amp;rdquo; which are provided for each characteristic described. Rather than exacerbating the controversial questions surrounding these issues, this book provides meaningful action points that will prove effective for a wide range of interpretations.&lt;/p&gt;" />

While many books analyze and debate the finer points of church government, few have been written on both elders and deacons, and fewer still successfully show how to identify and reproduce legitimate leaders and willing servants throughout the ranks of the church body.</p><p>Thabiti Anyabwile writes from his expertise as a pastor and an elder as well as from his experience of being led by faithful men—men who saw in him the fundamental qualities listed in Scripture and invested their time, energy, and love into grooming him to take their place. Balancing thoughtful analysis of pertinent passages with thorough application for practical use in a contemporary context, Anyabwile answers the questions, “Who should we look for to lead and serve in the church?” and “What should they do to fulfill their calling?” Most helpful, perhaps, are the lists “Observations to make” and “Questions to ask,” which are provided for each characteristic described.
