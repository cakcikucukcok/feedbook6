  <title>The Bible and Feminism - Yvonne Sherwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This groundbreaking book breaks with established canons and resists some of the stereotypes of feminist biblical studies. It features a wide range of contributors who showcase new methodological and theoretical movements such as feminist materialisms, intersectionality, postidentitarian &#39;nomadic&#39; politics, gender archaeology, and lived religion, and theories of the human and the posthuman. The Bible and Feminism: Remapping the Field engages a range of social
and political issues, including migration and xenophobia, divorce and family law, abortion, &#39;pinkwashing&#39;, the neoliberal university, the second amendment, AIDS and sexual trafficking, and the politics of &#39;the veil&#39;. Foundational figures in feminist biblical studies work alongside new voices and contributors
from a multitude of disciplines in conversations with the Bible that go well beyond the expected canon-within-the-canon assumed to be of interest to feminist biblical scholars. Moving beyond the limits of a text-orientated model of reading, this collection looks at how biblical texts were actualized in the lives of religious revolutionaries, such as Joanna Southcott or Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz. It charts the politics of the Pauline veil in the self-understanding of Europe and reads the
&#39;genealogical halls&#39; in the book of Chronicles alongside acts of commemoration and forgetting in 9/11 and Tiananmen Square." />
