  <title>The Journey of a Shepherd&#39;s Wife - Virginia Cooper Stokes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Virginia Stokes has been a pastor&amp;rsquo;s wife for over 45 years. Through heartwarming personal testimony, she opens up about her childhood, life before the ministry and the churches which she and her husband have served. As well as the devastating reality of moving on when God called them to a new church. At times it is hard raising children under the watchful eyes of an entire congregation.

But in The Journey of A Shepherd&amp;rsquo;s Wife, Virginia is able to fine her place in the church and a way to use her talents for God&amp;mdash; the only one we should desire to please. Ministers&amp;rsquo;s wives and churchgoing women alike will find an ally in this shepherd&amp;rsquo;s wife who knows what it is like to feel tremendous hurt as well as great joy and love in the ministry.&lt;/p&gt;" />
