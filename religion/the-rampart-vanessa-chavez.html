  <title>The Rampart - Vanessa Chavez</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;If most of us were to be completely honest with ourselves, we would find places deep within us that cant trust God; at least not anymore.  Life experiences, our own or those of others around us, have left us doubting the true nature of God.  Is He really loving, big, faithful, trustworthy?  Do our prayers really reach heaven?  The Rampart is where we go to position ourselves to meet face to face with the one who is supposed to have been there when we needed Him most; the one who said He could do the impossible; or the one who still hasnt shown up yet.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;The Rampart is the place for those:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-who want to believe that God is who He claims to be, but cant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-who have journeyed with faith, only to face disappointment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-who are intrigued by the thought of being a friend of God but find Him unreachable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-who find themselves waiting and wondering how much longer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my own journey through life experiences, God has led me to a new place, one that has forever changed my perception of Him.  In this place I found a bittersweet communion with Him, a safe haven, the ability to trust again, and an avenue to freedom from all that would hold me backThe Rampart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
