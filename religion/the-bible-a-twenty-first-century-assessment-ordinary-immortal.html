  <title>The Bible: a Twenty-First Century Assessment - Ordinary Immortal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about truth. It is a sword that separates biblical fact from decaying human dogmatic tradition. Reminiscent of the days of Martin Luther, it provides an extensive reality check of the Holy Scripture. This assessment is not to provoke disharmony but instead to promote honesty and provide heretofore shunned accuracy. The author believes that God is not threatened by the concept of truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works.&lt;br /&gt; 
2 Timothy 3:1617&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The author has resisted proposing his personal interpretation or perspective. He believes that the Bible interprets itself and that no one is authorized ones own interpretation. Therefore, Scripture is used primarily without interjection. The author presents an unbiased review of not his own ideas but an impartial assessment of Scripture with reference to highly significant topics.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me. But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.&lt;br /&gt; 
Matthew 15:89&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him. God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.&lt;br /&gt;
John 4:23-24&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revelations will shake the foundations of false belief and will profoundly affect all those who call upon God in their pursuit of spiritual truth. The realism of unadulterated Scripture may challenge you and possibly shake your beliefs, but to worship God, truth must be paramount.&lt;/p&gt;" />
