  <title>Worlds Apart - Chuck Bomar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The life stage of 18-25-year-olds is completely different than it was in previous eras. In just one generation, we see contrasts that used to take two to three generations to surface. This massive shift has created frustration with older generations. Parents recognize this is a completely different world and struggle to relate. Others throw their arms up in bewilderment, assuming they’ll never understand. And many church leaders wish they’d “just grow up.” In this book, Chuck Bomar brings understanding, comfort, and direction to all of this. You’ll learn: -how the development of higher education has caused much of the separation between generations -the irreversible ways in which this generation has been impacted and how today’s college-aged person differs from the typical thoughts and values of older generations -the five major pursuits of college-aged people and why they pursue these areas Through profiles of college-aged people and testimonies of parents, you’ll explore in-depth issues college-age people face, how they process through them, and what influences their decisions so you can effectively minister to them.&lt;/P&gt;" />
