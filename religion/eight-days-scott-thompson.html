  <title>Eight Days - Scott Thompson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;LIFE&amp;rsquo;S SHORT WHEN COMPARED TO ETERNITY, BUT ETERNITY IS ONLY WORTH IT BECAUSE OF LIFE.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Clive Kinsella lived a good life. He had a family who loved him and he was never without a job, a place to live, or a warm meal. But Clive died unfulfilled. Despite all his gifts he could only see what he didn&amp;rsquo;t have. He never wrote for a big newspaper in a big city. He never traveled the world. In fact, he never got out of his small Southern town. And &amp;hellip; he never faced the ghosts that haunted him.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; At his own funeral Clive meets Pachu, his grandfather who had died years before, and with Pachu he begins a journey through his life where he has to finally face his greatest regrets and agonies. But, if Clive can&amp;rsquo;t overcome his regrets he&amp;rsquo;ll be forced to wander the place between Heaven and Earth. Each day Clive revisits events in life in a sort of spiritual recording, the same events that took him from being an optimistic young man to a curmudgeon. For every day he overcomes he gets to visit a place on earth he never saw before, and the reader is taken to places like Half Dome in Yosemite and Venice, where Pachu and Clive discuss existence and the meaning of life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; After his eight days Clive takes on one final challenge of life in a climb to the top of a mountain above an enchanted valley, where the gate to eternity awaits. In Heaven Clive meets loved ones who had gone before him, and the events of his life come together to make him the man he&amp;rsquo;ll be for eternity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
