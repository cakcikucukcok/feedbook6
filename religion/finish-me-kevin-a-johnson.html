  <title>Finish Me - Kevin A. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="God has the ability to take the pure chaos of a life filled with divorce, drug addictions, sexual misconduct, mental depression, and every negative experience known to humans, and make a life filled with unending peace and power. He alone has the power to change an unchangeable thing into something that it could never have become by itself. 
In Finish Me: A Beautiful Revelation of the Finished You, Kevin A. Johnson shows that God has a finished plan for our lives, although our imperfect circumstances seem to dictate differently. Just as God took seven days to complete His creation as shown in the Book of Genesis, God works faithfully in the lives of Christian believers to bring them to the finish He desires for them. 
Apostle Johnson demonstrates, through sound wisdom, that the sum total of our lives is not in the way in which our lives might have begun, but is fully discovered in the way in which our lives are finished. He wants us to realize that dealing with the experiences of poverty, sexual abuse, verbal abuse, depression, or rape does not mean that our lives are over. Rather, he implores us to believe that God has a far more perfect finish for us, even though Satan has hit us with such darkened chaos. The author also wishes for us to understand that God has millions of days of continuous sunshine for every infrequent scary and dark moment of our lives.
Author Kevin A. Johnson, of Nashville, Tennessee, is a popular speaker and is the author of other books on living a Christian life of vision, purpose, and joy. He is a passionate servant of his God and Savior, Jesus Christ. 
We must know that even in the midst of our worst chaos, there exists an unseen supernatural blueprint of what we are truly meant to become. Kevin A. Johnsons Finish Me: A Beautiful Revelation of the Finished You inspires us to believe in and completely accept this truth." />
