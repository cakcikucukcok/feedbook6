  <title>God’S Baptism with the Holy Spirit - Samuel Siders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are many who falsely believe the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit ended in the first century. Over the years, I have had to research to find historical information that proves that conclusion is false. As a result, I found historical information that substantiates that the charismata had never ceased to be manifested by God. This book contains that historical information.
This book is also to share the overwhelming benefits God has provided with the baptism of his Spirit to be more victorious in our obedience to him, a greater threat to Satan, and to defend Gods baptism by using history and the scriptures. It has been Satans agenda to discourage those who profess to be born-again Christians from ever receiving this God-given baptism by deceiving preachers to blaspheme against this baptism." />
