  <title>Finding True Love - Natalie Maxberry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="am single but I am hoping. Praying for a mate. Someone to settle down with, marry and share a nice and successful life with. I believe that someone special is searching for me too, but, before I meet them. Before they show up at the door, let me make a check list similar to like when I go shopping at the store. I need to know if Im really prepared. OkayMy wardrobes together. I may have a good looking home and possibly a nice size bank account. These things are important but more importantlyis my thinking straight. Am I really clear. Am I truly ready for a good partner, truly ready for a good mate. Okaylets not panic. Lets be cool. Lets stop for a minute and put on our serious face. Now, Im tired of the games and waddling in worldliness, and, yes I really am ready to commit. Im ready for faithfulness. Im willing to make this great sacrifice to be and come clean. I will cook, wash, and sometime stay up through the night. Run around all day to keep things right. Relationships are work not just all fun. Realizing the work I put in is not just for the one of you but for the both of you. That what Im asked to do, expected to do will in the end help pull us through. That everything, all of it pays off like a million dollars in your pocket when you see you and your mate coming along, youre a happy couple. When the two of you are bonding, planning, staying together. When you roll through whatever obstacles that come your way. When youre able to laugh, sing and dance wrapped in one anothers arms. When youre blessed with a companion that you love and would die fortell me this, who really can ask for anything more. Once we realize there is nothing more important in life than to do as God said which is to meet and then wed. Once we really understand thisthere is nothing else to be said." />
