  <title>A Better Understanding (Vol. 1) - G. Ancel Killion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="SUMMARY OF WRITINGS
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
  All writings herein are resulting from an extensive search of the entire bible to determine if all things being taught about the Christian belief are factual. Along with considering those things being taught I have also considered the Bible is not in good order as far as prophesies are concerned. Many things God gave his writers of the scriptures were not of benefit for them at that time, but were intended for those living in the end times. In order to correctly determine the destination of the inhabitants of the earth as God has planned, I know it to be a fact that every prophesy has a fulfillment, and presented in these writings is what I have found that I believe to be those fulfillments. Many things that are found in the Old Testament are written as if they had already occurred, so this must be considered when reading those scriptures of prophesy. This is just another reason why some prophesies may seem to be out of order. In reading my findings most people of the Christian belief will come to realize they are in difference in their belief with what I have found. The churches claiming to be of the Christian belief have many different ideas about this belief, and by knowing about those different ideas that churches teach, I was determined to prove or disprove what I believe some of which to be misguided ideas. Those churches that maintain the idea that by the Bible being presented as New and Old Testament in dividing it, determining the Old Testament as history only, are making a grave mistake. In truth much of the Old Testament portion of the Bible contains prophesy yet to come about. This includes the very first prophesy of the Bible found at Genesis 3:15 which is only partially fulfilled, and contains Gods promise of eventually removing Satan from power. I have determined that God is allowing the earths population time to come to the realization only He can provide for what man needs to maintain a happy and enjoyable life on the earth. Had He not allowed this time that has passed since the failure of our original parents, those living today would not have had the potential for life. He did not create man to live on this planet without needing His direction. The great thing one must come to realize is the fact that God has plans for the earth to return it to what he intended from the very beginning of his putting man on it. He put man in the Garden of Eden for the purpose of populating the earth with his fleshly beings in which he created in his own image. He did not create the earth for it to then become non existent. Of those that find things that I have put in writing that do not agree, I ask that they at least study the scriptures provided to decide if what they have been taught might be in error. A great amount of mans doctrines have been incorporated many years ago in their teaching that leads those astray that truly want Bible truth. Those that use discernment will know those false teachings are leading them in the wrong direction. There truly are many mysteries contained in the Bible that can easily be misunderstood. Even those chosen by Christ that served with him while he was on the earth to help with his teaching did not totally understand the destination of the earth until they were told in private what to expect. Most of the false teachings that are found in the Christian belief today were initiated in the very first century after the death of those personally taught by Jesus Christ. In order to maintain those false doctrines being taught in the churches today, many scriptures that prove them in error must be omitted from the Bible in order to present those false beliefs. The greatest hindrance of these false teachings is to those that consider the Old Testament as history only. To those that refuse to accept the Old Testament as containing prophesy yet to be fulfilled might as well forget about reading any further. These will never come to a good understanding of the B" />
