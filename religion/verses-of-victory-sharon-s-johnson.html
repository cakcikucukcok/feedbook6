  <title>Verses of Victory - Sharon S. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you struggle to find victory in the difficult situations of life? Have you ever felt that there is no hope, no way out, or maybe even that God doesn&#39;t love you? 
If you have ever felt this way, know that you are not alone. We, as Christians, sometimes feel that no one truly understands when we go through hardships. After all, aren&#39;t we supposed to be worry-free once we begin to follow in Christ&#39;s footsteps? Not so! 
In fact, sometimes, as Christians, the difficulties we face seem even harsher, more gut-wrenching, than what others go through. Just know the devil is fighting you every step of the way. Why, you ask? Because He knows the blessings that are waiting for you are just around the corner. But as the Bible assures, our God will never leave you nor forsake you. So do not fear. Accept that God does love you, and through Him, the victory has already been won!" />
