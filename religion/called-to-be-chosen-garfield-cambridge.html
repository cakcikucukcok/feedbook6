  <title>Called to Be Chosen - Garfield Cambridge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;According to the Bible, God has promised that if any person seriously searches for Him with all their heart and with all their mind, He will let them find Him for this, we read in Jeremiah chapter # 29 vss. 12 thru 14, &quot;Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. And I will be found of you, saith the Lord: and I will turn away your captivity...&quot; God will, according to the Bible, send you many proofs of His goodness so that He may lead you to Himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is about the Bible and it&#39;s about God who wrote the Bible. The book speaks directly to the relationship between a Holy God and a sinful human race. Its intention is to steer all its readers to read and study the scriptures for they are which that testify of Jesus Christ and in them are found the answers to the issues of life. The book highlights who we are in the eyes of God and who He has created us to be. It seeks to motivate its readers to examine their lives in light of what the Bible has to say. It is a book written to help us think about what our purpose is on this earth. It lets us know, that each one of us can do great things with the help of God; who strengthens all men that believe that the Lord, He is God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book lets us know, that the Bible describes God as the Creator of the universe and everything in it, both the visible and the invisible. The book&#39;s intention also, is to let the reader know, that God has a better plan for his and her life than the life they have outside of Him. Life is very short, and the book makes the point that it is God&#39;s desire that all mankind can have eternal life through Christ. The book addresses sin and God&#39;s remedy for it. It talks about the love that God has for sinners, even though He cannot and will not condone mankind&#39;s sinful ways. If we need encouragement, the book shares encouragements from the Bible. If any person is seeking guidance, the book points its readers to where they can find it in the Bible. The book is not boring, but it&#39;s about how life can be lived with God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
