  <title>Less Than Perfect - Ann Spangler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What can the Bible&amp;rsquo;s most flawed men and women reveal about who God is and how he reaches out to less-than-perfect people? In &lt;em&gt;Less Than Perfect,&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Ann Spangler takes us beyond cardboard cutouts of 38 biblical characters to show us how these were real individuals who had dreams, temptations, and weaknesses just like us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether considering the murderous Herodias, the scheming Jacob, or the doubting Sarah, Spangler approaches both familiar and lesser known characters with fresh eyes. We meet each of these individuals again as if for the first time as Spangler offers a dramatic retelling of their lives, insight into the historical and cultural context of their time, and key takeaway points for our lives today. Each chapter includes questions for discussion or reflection, making &lt;em&gt;Less Than Perfect &lt;/em&gt;ideal for individual or group Bible study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entertaining, informative, and inspirational, &lt;em&gt;Less Than Perfect&lt;/em&gt; gives you a big picture view of the Bible even as it takes you into the hearts and minds of people with struggles just like yours. As you learn more about the individuals who are part of your spiritual family tree, you&amp;rsquo;ll discover why God loves to use imperfect people to tell his perfect story of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;" />
