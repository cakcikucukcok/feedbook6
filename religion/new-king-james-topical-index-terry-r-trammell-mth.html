  <title>New King James Topical Index - Terry R. Trammell, Mth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a topical index for the New King James Version of the Bible. The reason author Terry R. Trammell created this index is that, even though he knew where many topics may be located, it would help many other people who were less knowledgeable. He decided to put something together that would help others in their studies by having a topical index, helping them to locate particular subjects and topics more easily like it has him. This will save more time than using concordances, as they help you look for words, not topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This New King James Version Topical Index covers all sixty-six books of the Bible, both the Old and New Testaments. In this topical index, you will find that all the books will have a heading, a sub-heading, a list of the topics that are within that particular book, plus the page number of where that topic begins and ends. It has already helped Mr. Trammell a great deal. He is sure it will help you in your study of Gods Word, as well. Even if you are not studying as a student but are just looking for a certain topic, this topical index will be of great use.&lt;/p&gt;" />
