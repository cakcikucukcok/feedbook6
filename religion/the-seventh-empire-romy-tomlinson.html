  <title>The Seventh Empire - Romy Tomlinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A novel that grabbed my interest. The author has penned an intriguing, chilling account of biblical truths on end time scenarios that make a gripping read. Its a sobering reminder of the tragedies and triumph of the days coming to planet Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr. Jim Henry&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Pastor Emeritus  First Baptist Orlando &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President  Southern Baptist Convention 1994-1996&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ancient prophecy foretells of Jesus returning to earth and setting up his kingdom. When a man suddenly appears in Jerusalem and proceeds to conquer the nations of the world in one epic battle, people question if this was he.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some claimed the man was actually an alien and used advanced technology to win the fight. Others claimed he was, indeed, Jesus and that his appearance was the fulfillment of the ancient prophecy. Either way, he established his rule over the nations of the earth, and people began calling his kingdom The Seventh Empire. What would the world be like under his reign?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new ruler named Jerusalem as his capital, and built the city into one the likes of which the world had never seen before. Under his administration, mankind enjoyed unheard of peace and prosperity. Advances in medicine led to a tenfold increase in peoples lifespans and the virtual elimination of sickness and disease. Breakthroughs in science opened up new worlds, and man began to explore space again.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For nearly a thousand years, all seemed good. But what was life really like in this Millennial Kingdom? Some were not satisfied and began to think of rebellion. How would the rebellion end, and what would mankinds fate now be? Was there to be another war, another empire, or would The Seventh Empire and its leader survive?&lt;/p&gt;" />
