  <title>The Cross Trap - Elmer M. Haygood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Cross Trap is a re-evaluation of the events surrounding the Crucifixion to show that they were not isolated occurrences but part of a well conceived conspiracy to send the Son of God back to God as a sinner. The scriptures focus on the religious leaders&#39; opposition to Jesus&#39; status as an authoritative teacher; however, the underlying focus of Satan was on Jesus as the perfect sacrificial Lamb for the remission of sin. Even though the religious leaders did not understand or believe Jesus&#39; primary role as the savior, Satan certainly had a good understanding of it. The conflicts Jesus experienced in his ministry are only the finale of the anger that had festered in the spiritual world since his birth. Death for Jesus was not enough. His sanctity as the Lamb of God had to be destroyed, thus making him an unworthy sacrifice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why was Jesus&#39; death by crucifixion?&lt;br /&gt;
Was Judas given thirty pieces of silver for a kiss?&lt;br /&gt;
Why did two thieves die with Jesus?&lt;br /&gt;
Why was there vinegar and gall at the cross?&lt;br /&gt;
Why did the soldier pierce Jesus with the spear?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cross Trap will answer these questions and explain why the Crucifixion was a formidable and almost perfect trap.&lt;/p&gt;" />
