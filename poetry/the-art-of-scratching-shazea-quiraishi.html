Working from historical and literary sources, Quraishi never allows her research to speak louder than the human voices of her characters, a community of courtesans in Ancient India. Their individual feelings and desires emerge through lines which are simultaneously spare and sensuous&amp;amp;#8217; &amp;amp;#150; Richard O&amp;amp;#8217;Brien, Poetry London.&lt;/div&gt;" />
