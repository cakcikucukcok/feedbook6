  <title>Rabbits, Poets &amp; Puppets - Vincent Convertito, Thomas Koch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rabbits, Poets, and Puppets (RPP) is a collection of modern American poetry written by Vincent Convertito and Thomas Koch that fits perfectly on a book shelf and even better near a bottle of red wine and a warm fire. From the most obscure corner of a room to the infinite expanse of a night sky, two oddly similar men compromise on a single vision in this very uncommon collaboration. 
Rabbits, Poets &amp; Puppets is a unique presentation of 53 original poems selected and arranged into 4 parts with all the care and consideration that a musical group should take for their dozen or so tracks that will make up an album. 
Together for the first time, Koch and Convertito offer this first installment in a series of previously unreleased and new poetry as &quot;just the beginnings&quot; of their readily accessible and immediately engaging poetry. 
Forget what you know or don&#39;t like about poetry and let Rabbits, Poets &amp; Puppets entertain and inspire readers, writers and admirers of all things good in the world." />
