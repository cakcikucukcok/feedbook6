  <title>Once Upon a Moonbeam - April Morrow</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;What are your experiences of life? In this compilation of poetry written over a span of twenty years, the author takes you on an adventure --- one that is easily relatable to your own. Her own experience of awakening to joy and bliss, and connection with all of humanity, is expressed through her poems. We see that we are not all that different as human beings, even though our circumstances may be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some ways, we are all still children at heart. Her words are at times playful and joyous; curious about life and our surroundings; and looking to what makes us who we are. The poems have a simplicity about them yet allow the reader to experience something beyond the surface and the words. They allow us to connect with all of mankind.&lt;/p&gt;" />
