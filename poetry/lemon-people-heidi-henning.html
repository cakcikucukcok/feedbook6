  <title>Lemon People - Heidi Henning</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This second poetry collection continues the combination of universal and personal, the themes relevant to my sense of identity and agency.  Symbols, abstracts, emotions and descriptions work together in these minimal poems, to create a moment, a picture in the mind of the reader.  I draw inspiration from land, from space and context, from nature, from my children, from my past.  Poetry is an apt form for me, as it becomes like a process of photography, a fresh and original way of conveying a moment in very few words, with little dilution, but strong messaging, imagery and meaning.  Lemon People comes from a more resolved place in my life, with meaning and perspective, as someone in their late thirties with more time to develop my personal craft, and experience." />
