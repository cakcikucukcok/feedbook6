  <title>Mccullough&#39;s Roost - Susan These</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    Susan Lee These
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Born August 18, 1954
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I was born the eldest of four children to Thomas and Wilma McLeod.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Raised in North Vancouver with my two brothers and a sister, I was very lucky to have had a wonderful and normal childhood.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    We (John and I) were married in September of 1972. In 1975, we moved to the beautiful Sunshine
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Coast, where we have lived on McCullough Road. We have raised two lovely daughters.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Poetry has always been a part of my life, so this has been a dream fulfilled.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    There have been well over five hundred people that passed through the doors of our home; each and every one of these people has left a mark on my heart
    somewhere. Perhaps one day, instead of writing
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    poems, I will write of the wonderful stories that happened at McCulloughs Roost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    I hope you enjoy reading this book as it is my heart and emotional expressions of people that have touched me throughout the years.
