  <title>Thy Will Be Done and Emotions in Poetry - Hannah McCarty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Thy Will Be Done is a lesson Hannah had to learn after her mothers death in September, 1969.  She couldnt accept her mothers death and lost her faith in God.  I know I had a struggle with God, but he wouldnt let me go.  I had to learn that as I was praying, I was saying to God to Let Thy Will Be Done but what I really wanted was for my will to be done.  My prayers were answered but the answer was no.  This was something I had to learn and my struggle with God taught me a lesson that I will never forget.  As Hannah learned to accept Gods will so evolved her talent for writing poetry and so was created Emotions in Poetry." />
