  <title>Mystic Wayfarer - Kristina Sanborn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Faith is the Path
Grace is the Bridge
Surrender is the Gate
Love is the Garden
Over the course of more years than I care to admit, Ive been witness to Kristinas multi-faceted talents as actress, musician, writer, composer, fellow spiritual seeker and dear friend. Of all of her worthy endeavors, perhaps most compelling is her poetry. It is a reflection of her soul; an out-picturing of her inner and outer travels and, as such, a daily mantra of a visionary creative spirit; an expression for you to share and experience with her in consciousness. Mystic Wayfarer, One Souls Journey Into Light is powerful, purposeful, intimate, and, like Kristina herself, utterly unique in its power to alter your world. It is profoundly personal, yet it reveals a recognizable, emergent collective wisdom. As you revel in each stanza, you are invited to delight in your own quest for ecstasy, seeking union with the Divine through a discovery of your own unfolding divinity, held in each painful, joyful, cherished moment of humanness.  ~ Donna Walker, Host/Producer &quot;Pacifica Performance Showcase,&quot; KPFK 90.7 FM, Pacifica Radio.
Within the rhythm of her excellent poesy, Kristina Sanborn walks us through a life well-earned. One wants to travel with each individual poem in a front pocket, and take it out to look at its map - which means there will be the pleasure of dancing through its theme once more - and then satisfied, ready oneself for the adventure of the following stride. And though they each stand on their own, I found the collection of poems to be mighty and muscular when read in a conscious promenade, for the complete work engages the readers mind to an insistent and necessary wayfaring, a forward motion, a need. The prize is a most certain peace of mind, as her beautiful images leap up and encircle you on your walk - like luminous autumn leaves in a very brave wind. ~ Randall Stuart, Founder &amp; Director of CERIMON HOUSE, A Sanctuary for the Humanities
Kristina&#39;s poetry, in her new book Mystic Wayfarer, moves in the serpentine ways of women&#39;s mystery. Seeping into the soul and dancing you from the inside out. Her journey carries you to places near and far, inside and out and brings you back to the home of your own body with infinite grace and beauty. It has been a joy and a privilege to bear witness to her journey and dance in the mystery with her. May others come to find as much joy, pleasure and value in her words as I have.~ Sandy Pendleton, MFT, Teacher and Coach, Embodied Wisdom" />
