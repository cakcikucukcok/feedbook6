  <title>Self-Portrait as Wikipedia Entry - Dean Rader</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;By writing honestly about the difficulties of self-representation, Rader represents himself as a writer who cares deeply about his audience and his craft.&quot; &amp;#151;&lt;I&gt;ZYZZYVA&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Rader&#39;s poetry asks how to be an artist in a nation founded on and still struggling with the demand for representation and what poetry as a medium means in an era of representational sprawl.&quot; &amp;#151;&lt;I&gt;Jacket&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wikipedia articles are never finalized. In Dean Rader&#39;s energized and inventive new book, the poet considers identity of self and society as a Wikipedia page&amp;#151;sculpted and transformed by the ever-present push and pull of politics, culture, and unseen forces. And, in the case of Rader, how identity can be affected by the likes of Paul Klee&#39;s paintings and the characters from the children&#39;s stories about Frog and Toad. Rader&#39;s cagey voice is full of humor and inquiry, warmly inviting readers to fully participate in the creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;From How We Survive: A Tryptich:&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;This afternoon I took a nap&lt;BR&gt;wearing a costume that looks&lt;BR&gt;just like me. Inside it I felt like&lt;BR&gt;  another person who happened&lt;BR&gt;to know so many things about me,&lt;br&gt;like my preference for almonds over&lt;BR&gt;cashews, how sometimes, when&lt;BR&gt;I am in a strange room, I imagine&lt;BR&gt;hopping from one piece of&lt;BR&gt;furniture to the next . . .&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born in Oklahoma, &lt;B&gt;Dean Rader&lt;/B&gt; has published in the fields of poetry, American Indian studies, and popular culture.
