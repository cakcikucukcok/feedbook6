  <title>A Gold Orchid: The Love Poems of Tzu Yeh - Lenore Mayhew, William McNaughton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;A Gold Orchid&lt;/I&gt; is a rare collection of classical Chinese erotic and love poetry translated for the first time.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Chinese erotic poetry was at one time thought to be nonexistent, simply because it was considered unfit to translate from the imperial anthologies, This translation of poems of Tzu Yeh, a 4th-century wine shop girl, exposes a world the emperors may not have cared to record for posterity. But it is precisely this world that has fascination for the Western reader, who will discover in it, perhaps a shock of recognition, the same currents of feeling that rippled beneath alluring surfaces wherever girls like Tzu Yeh have offered entertainment and flattery, beauty, wit, and sometimes love-to paying customers.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Following Tzu Yeh through the pleasure-chasing seasons into her years of bitter memories, the reader places together, but he left her &quot;with a bitter heart still beating to each day&amp;#8217;s sun.&quot; She weaves. She remembers. &quot;In thin silk dress, red sleeves a flutter&quot; she searches for &quot;a bold someone with a heart of mine&quot;--her gold-orchid friend.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;These beautiful and original poems are made available to Western readers in a translation that fuses the imagery of age-old China with a supple, lively modern idiom.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
