  <title>Stepping into the Wilderness - Ime Albert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ime Albert holds an honorary doctorate degree in business administration from Evangel University, Springfield, Missouri, USA. He is a successful Nigerian businessman and politician.
He holds a Bachelor of Arts degree in theatre arts from the University of Calabar, Calabar, Nigeria.
He is a born-again Christian author, poet, novelist, and philosopher. He is a reformed Christian vessel in the hands of the Lord. He is a philanthropist extraordinaire with a very large heart.
He is married to Patricia, and the marriage is blessed with three children: Roland, Rachael, and Rhema. He is indeed a blessed man.
 STEPPING INTO THE WILDERNESS is a poetic expression of the travails, troubles, agonies, and sweetness of life. It is an intellectual expression drawn from real-life situations. It explains real-life events, people, places, as well as the propelling forces of life, which are controlled by Almighty God and Satan.
This book reveals the true nature of man, the very gifts, talents, and potentialities that make the human race a rich base of incredible resources  bottled in the providential wealth of divinity.
The fundamental truth as revealed by the trends captured in this work shows Almighty God not only as wonderful but as the most powerful source of wealth, fame, and riches.
He is also the author of No Love Lost (A Trilogy), The Fury of God also Best Parents, Worst Couples, and The Rich, The Famous, and The Blessed, all contemporary classics.
THE BEAUTIFUL ANGEL the extract shown in this book is a radiant work of my late son Richmond Ime Albert, who died on the 22nd of May 2011. He was aged 16 years, and was a Student of Bridge Water Independent School.
He was diagnosed of Cadiomyopathy, a heart vessel disease on the 10th of April 2011, and was admitted in the hospital in England but was later discharged two week later and certified to be okay, but two months later he died in sleep. He was particularly in love with Arsenal Football Club of London. May his gentle soul rest in the bosom of our lord." />
