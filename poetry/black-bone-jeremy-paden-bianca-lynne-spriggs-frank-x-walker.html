  <title>Black Bone - Jeremy Paden, Bianca Lynne Spriggs, Frank X Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The Appalachian region stretches from Mississippi to New York, encompassing rural areas as well as cities from Birmingham to Pittsburgh. Though Appalachia&#39;s people are as diverse as its terrain, few other regions in America are as burdened with stereotypes. Author Frank X Walker coined the term &quot;Affrilachia&quot; to give identity and voice to people of African descent from this region and to highlight Appalachia&#39;s multicultural identity. This act inspired a group of gifted artists, the Affrilachian Poets, to begin working together and using their writing to defy persistent stereotypes of Appalachia as a racially and culturally homogenized region.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;After years of growth, honors, and accomplishments, the group is acknowledging its silver anniversary with  &lt;I&gt;Black Bone&lt;/I&gt;. Edited by two newer members of the Affrilachian Poets, Bianca Lynne Spriggs and Jeremy Paden,  &lt;I&gt;Black Bone&lt;/I&gt; is a beautiful collection of both new and classic work and features submissions from Frank X Walker, Nikky Finney, Gerald Coleman, Crystal Wilkinson, Kelly Norman Ellis, and many others. This illuminating and powerful collection is a testament to a groundbreaking group and its enduring legacy.&lt;/P&gt;" />
