  <title>The Complete Poems of Andrew Marvell - Andrew Marvell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The English metaphysical poet Andrew Marvell is most commonly associated with his contemporaries, John Donne, George Herbert, and his colleague and friend, John Milton. His most famous poem &quot;To His Coy Mistress&quot; is a seductive chant to a would-be lover to seize the moment. &quot;The Garden&quot; is an ode to the tranquility of a retirement from public life. Marvell, who was himself a politician, opines for the simpler life of the garden. Also included in this collection are &quot;An Horatian Ode upon Cromwell&#39;s Return from Ireland,&quot; &quot;The Mower&#39;s Song&quot; and the country house poem &quot;Upon Appleton House.&quot; The entire corpus of Marvell&#39;s poetry is brought together here in this edition of &quot;The Complete Poems of Andrew Marvell,&quot; which has been edited with a memorial introduction by Rev. Alexander B. Grosart. T. S. Eliot wrote of Marvell&#39;s work that &quot;it is more than a technical accomplishment, or the vocabulary and syntax of an epoch; it is what we have designated tentatively as wit, a tough reasonableness beneath the slight lyric grace.&quot;" />
