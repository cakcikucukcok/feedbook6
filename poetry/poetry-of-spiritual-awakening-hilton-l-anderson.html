  <title>Poetry of Spiritual Awakening - Hilton L. Anderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Poetry of Spiritual Awakening&lt;/i&gt; presents a collection of poetry arranged in three groupings designed to indicate levels of conscious awareness experienced by author Hilton L. Anderson. Waking up spiritually is an individual process; even so, there are common themes experienced by many people that may help others in their own spiritual journey. In general terms, the separate ego state is focused primarily on the external reality while the spiritual is more focused on internal consciousness. 
Perhaps another way of explaining this spiritual awakening is recognizing the shift from the rational mind to heart consciousness. The way in which the poems of this collection are arranged is an attempt to make this shift obvious. Through the practice of forgiveness and the awareness of love, the separate self of the ego begins to lose its hold, allowing the awareness of the larger self to become the focus of attention. This awareness heals the separation of self from others and the Divine. 
Ultimately the awareness of the unitary nature of existence becomes known. The fear of death and its resolution are prominent concerns of many of the poems. The need to face the reality of death and understand it in a meaningful way is one of the basic learning explored by the poetry." />
