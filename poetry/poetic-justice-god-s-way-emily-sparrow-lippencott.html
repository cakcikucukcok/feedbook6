  <title>Poetic Justice … God’S Way - Emily Sparrow Lippencott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior? I know that in order for this book to have the impact on you that I pray it does, you need to know your Creator and Savior. You need to know the mercy of God and how incredible He is. This book is meant to help you walk a little closer to God. If you have not done so, I urge you to take a moment and pray. God doesnt want anyone to be lost, including you and me. Just pray to Him that you know He died for your sins and that you need Him in your heart and life. Tell Him you are sorry, and let Him know you are submitting to His will. And by all means, tell Him you love Him.&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except by Him. There is no other way to heaven. You will be so glad you submitted, and now join me and countless others as we learn more about God and as we walk toward heaven.&lt;/p&gt; 
	&lt;p&gt;In the form of poetry, I have written about some well-known characters of the Bible and some you may not know. You will see the way God has worked in the lives of many people, some of whom you may not think deserve His mercy and grace. I hope it encourages you to pick up the Bible and read for yourself Gods amazing love story.&lt;/p&gt;" />
