  <title>Intuition: the Ultimate Unity - Nicole Cavaluzzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Intuition: The Ultimate Unity is a collaboration of fantasy and reality inspired poems with photo art. In this profound poetry collection, Nicole confronts the entrenched mind, examining the distinction, transition and union of fantasy and reality. She takes us deep into the subliminal mind, challenging those questions we all ask ourselves: Is my ego or my subconscious driving my thoughts? Is this feeling inside me a consequence of love or pain? Are my ideas derived from a sober or altered state of mind? Is this ending really just my new beginning? 
   In Intuition: The Ultimate Unity Nicole aims to open our minds and touch our souls with words and images created by her personal experiences exploring the magical wonders of the human psyche. She shares her encounters in hope to intrigue us to embrace and interchange our own fantasies, realities, thoughts, dreams, visions, feelings and reactions. 
   Nicole sets the precedence that by following our intuition, anything and everything is possible inside our minds. Within our minds, we can enable our fantasies to transcend into our realities and thus, experience the ultimate unity. Nicole vows to always believe in the possibility of the ultimate unity of fantasy and reality, as she follows hers: Intuition.
Nicole has a consistent and distinctive poetic voice, one that is developed only through the diligent pursuit of one&#39;s craft. In this collection of poems she chronicles the sometimes tortured journey of falling in and out of love, and the dangers of surrendering emotionally and physically to another. Her poetry is often tinged with irony and yet she does not succumb to cynicism but perseveres. Her resilient hopefulness and sense of self-sacrifice is reminiscent of Oscar Wilde&#39;s thrush in his fairytale, The Happy Prince, where the bird presses its breast against a pale rose to redden its petals with his blood. It is a rose bought at great price that is finally given to an unappreciative lover who throws it away. ~ 
Gabor Barabas, Producer, NJ Repertory Company
In her search for distinction between fantasy and reality, Nicole confronts and exposes the human psyche in her latest collaboration of poetry with photo art, Intuition, The Ultimate Unity.  She eloquently combines creative writing with abstract, yet beautiful, images. Insightful and impressive, Intuition, The Ultimate Unity is an impassioned experience: Truly a ride for one&#39;s senses!&quot; ~
