  <title>Insanity - E.J. Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Allow me to introduce myself, my name is Eugene Morris and I was 
born in a small town known as Liberal Kansas, and most of the time 
there isnt a thing to do besides get into trouble or drink your life away. 
Not saying I dont enjoy a drink every now and then but enough about 
that lets get down to it. 
Ive always had a fascination with horror movies, horror novels, 
anything Halloween related really. 
Such as monsters, demons, creatures of the night, actually monsters 
and sighting in our world today. 
I guess you could say I am obsessed with the unknown, which led me to interesting moments in 
my life which I guess you could say are hard to explain. 
But Im sure all of us have heard that at least once in our lives, I mean all of us are a little curious 
about what may or may not be hiding out there in our big world fi lled with things that we can 
never hope to understand. 
Yet out of each possible outcome I always arrive at the same subject that has always puzzled me 
most, its a thing called Insanity normally used to describe someone who has lost there minds, 
someone so far gone that we will never know again. 
A horrid feeling such as this can not be contained, it eats away at the person until there is 
nothing left to eat. 
A hollow existence is the worst hell of all, thus is the reason I wrote this book to demonstrate 
the true fear of loosing ones mind. 
Just like so many writers have before I even began to write. 
Each one of my tales puts you into the mind of someone who lives each day in torment by the 
very things they cant explain. 
A small look into such an odd and terrifying thing, such a thing that truly exists in all of us dare 
I say, some have it contained while others are lost in it. 
Welcome to the horrors which dwell within the unknown. 
Welcome to the world known as INSANITY" />
