  <title>Cogent Wanderings - Neville Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;IN MEMORY OF&lt;br&gt;
NEVILLE WILSON&lt;br&gt;
(1936 - 2010)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start with a love for life.&lt;br&gt;
Be inspired by everything from the mundane to the profound.&lt;br&gt;
Find freedom and wisdom in words&lt;br&gt;
Cultivate a talent for writing,&lt;br&gt;
and you have the tools to make beautiful poetry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neville Wilson had love, inspiration and talent to produce over a thousand works. His inspiration ranged from watching seagulls along the coast of Maine to reflecting on the news of the day. But nothing inspired him more than the love he had for family, and especially for his beloved wife of forty years, Reta . Even as he saw the end of his life before him, he found inspiration in that journey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 2007 interview with a local publication, Neville summarized his life: It takes time to reach the center of who you are. I found that life is ever changing, and there are no certainties, only possibilities. Love is mans last great hope of peace and the source of all thats important. The journey is whats important. Take this, Nevilles second poetic journey, and as you peruse through these poems, be inspired to write your own.&lt;/p&gt;
