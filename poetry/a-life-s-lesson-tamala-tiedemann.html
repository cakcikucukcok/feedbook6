  <title>A Life’S Lesson - Tamala Tiedemann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was around 3rd grade when Tamalas sister, Jordan, her cousin, Autumn, and she used to write and sing songs. They used to say they were going to become a band some day. Well, that didnt happen but they did write their own song lyrics. After Tamala and her sister moved away from their cousin, she continued writing-song lyrics, poems, quotes, thoughts and questions on just about everything. She wrote things based on her perception of her own life and others lives and well as her day-dreaming thoughts.  Everything in the book was written by her at some point between 3rd grade and now. She is still writing and will probably continue for a long time, so expect another book to come out a few years from now!" />
