  <title>As the World Turns, Revelation - Artis Howard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am an extremely true child of God! I gave my life to Christ at the age of fourteen. Im forty-five years of age as we speak. I keep a strong grip on my faith in God by any means necessary! I try to read my Holy Bible daily to keep me focused on the Word of God. Over the years, Ive learned so much about God and Jesus Christ. However, I was told by God to deliver his Word to the very best of my ability! Therefore, I beg urgently that you allow me to have just a few minutes of your precious time to introduce As the World Turns, Revelation: Part 1, which contains serious testimonies and breathtaking spiritual poetry. I have five more books following As the World Turns, Revelation. To be more specific, there are six parts of As the World Turns, Revelation. I actually believe these six books will be very interesting to Gods children." />
