  <title>By the Morning of Our Healing - Steven C. House</title>
      <meta name="description" content="By The Morning of Our Healing contains poems with passion, depth, sincerity and the stuff of living. They convey honestly and vigorously the joys, pains and rough resolutions of living and loving in the world. The book calls the reader to reflect on that invisible contract we all have with life. Remember that naive and idealistic state of sweet young love, becoming aware for the first time of the immense power of the ocean or the unpredictable impact of growling death? In response, we are all called to show up and participate. These poems convey one man&#39;s journey through these unique yet universal experiences. With confusion and anxiety, joy and sudden pleasure, the book takes the reader on a powerful journey through the geography of relationships. The book calls to mind the awareness that suffering does not stop us from succeeding. Healing happens all the time and in quite gentle and subtle ways. The book reaches into scenes and senses of living, loving and loss. It reflects the wisdom, triumphs and tragedies encountered along the way. Expressed here as well, is how we are shaped by the power of the wind, the grandeur of the mountains, the ethereal presence of the ocean and God&#39;s subtle voice in all. You will find here an eclectic collection of poems. Some are as serious as leaving home. Others are as carefree as an ice cream sundae. Hopefully you will identify with and hear echoes of your own voice and journey. These friendly poems will take you on a pleasant and challenging ride through living and loving that may get your heart pumping again and remind you that you are still alive and the fat lady hasn&#39;t sung yet!. &lt;br&gt;" />
