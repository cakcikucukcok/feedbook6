  <title>Thirty-One Days - Poethics Oblivion Stareyes - Dark Sun</title>
      <meta name="description" content="As Poethics Obilivion Stareyes - Dark Sun, this is my first book of Poetry.  I have written Poetry, however, authored by my real name, which is Verlena Sexton-Walker, and as Poethics Oblivion Stareyes and therefore, have published six Poetry Books and all are live. Thirty-One Days was written in the presence of a Spiritual God.  I felt as if I was a castaway in such of a new world and thus, my Poetry was a channel of articulation brought from the spiritual realm via the mind by means of meditation.
      As a Psalmist, which is the qualifier that defines my Poetry, I have scribed Thirty-One Days in an academia presence of insight and theory.  Theologically, Thirty-One Days is an anointing of sanctification given by the Spiritual God within a divine aura and with the dignity of a Goddess.
      Thirty-One Days idolizes the human life formed as a supernatural existence that is prayer based, theologically sound, ministry of the truth, and bound by a higher order to come.  Dogmatically, Thirty-One Days captures a doctrine of faith that is shown throughout its poetic verses.  Scripturally prepared to a monotheistic belief, Thirty-One Days is mystically written to enrich and enhance the insight to develop foresight via the creation of the Spiritual God who we sense when we call upon the Lord.
      In all, Thirty-One Days was etched in the State of Michigan by a native Mississippian and therefore, it is a written document of circumstances and situational melodrama that is the factual truth in occurrence in which it is dedicated to those who provided Poethics Oblivion Stareyes - Dark Sun with her poetic stories via poetry, prayer, tall tales, and parables." />
