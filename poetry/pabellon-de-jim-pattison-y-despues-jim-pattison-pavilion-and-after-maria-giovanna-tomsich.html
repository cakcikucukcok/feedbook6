  <title>Pabellon De Jim Pattison Y Despues / Jim Pattison Pavilion and After - Maria Giovanna Tomsich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jim Pattison Pavillion and After, Jazz, Abbadon, Archaelogical Sites, Bestiary, and the Spanish versions are the five sections comprising Maria Giovanna Tomsichs third collection of poems covering the ground of a life still scrutinized by the author. Is this the poets task? According to MGT, the analysis of levels of consciousness and as far as they are accessible, levels of the subconscious connect every individual with his or her environment. 
Relation that generates responsibilities and action. Jim Pattison, of about a hundred and ninety free verses, is a composition of gratitude to health workers in the pavilion, to the place, especially the space allowed to art, always therapeutic regardless of the viewers rejection or acceptance. In this poem, the experience of illness is intertwined with the reading of the playwright Euripides (485 BC), with his tragedy Iphigenia Among the Taurians. Viewing Ken Burnss documentary about jazz inspired her to express both her admiration for the documentary and her attraction to jazz besides giving her the opportunity for some autobiographical touches.
Abbadon satirises, one of agings quirks, forever losing and looking for misplaced objects. The humorous tone conceals graver themes, like greed. The archeological sites are a constant source of interest and fascination for MGT as are animals because environment concerns are transparent." />
