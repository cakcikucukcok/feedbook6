  <title>Asleep in the Teapot - Judy Dally</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;In his introduction to &lt;em&gt;180 more&lt;/em&gt;, an anthology of which he was editor, Billy Collins spoke of a preference for poetry in which &amp;lsquo;a human voice is clearly sounded &amp;ndash; poems with the front door left open&amp;rsquo;. Judy Dally writes poetry in which the door is ?ung wide and the welcome mat is out. Wander inside and you feel as though you&amp;rsquo;ve come home &amp;ndash; to the minutiae of our &amp;lsquo;little lives&amp;rsquo; made suddenly important and tender and funny by Judy&amp;rsquo;s clear-eyed and compassionate poetry. And don&amp;rsquo;t be fooled by the seeming simplicity of some poems; Judy has a deftness of touch that less nimble poets fall over themselves to achieve. To many non-poets, poetry doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a living presence at all, let alone one with a human voice. To them, poetry is just as dead now as it was inside their dusty schoolbooks. Judy Dally will convince them otherwise.&amp;#39; &amp;ndash; Louise Nicholas&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Judy Dally&amp;rsquo;s delightful and delicious book of poems will be the perfect antidote to those who, angry, frustrated and confused, have given up reading contemporary poetry. The poem &amp;lsquo;Anniversary&amp;rsquo; is one of the most exquisite love poems I have ever read.&amp;#39; &amp;ndash; Jeff Guess&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;#39;Judy Dally&amp;rsquo;s wit, wisdom and humour are refreshing and rare. Like a degustatlon dinner, &lt;em&gt;Asleep In the Teapot&lt;/em&gt; contains a range of different courses and remarkable ?avours. Judy deftly captures an era, its people and their common psyche, and doesn&amp;rsquo;t shy away from darkness. From the black humour of &amp;lsquo;After the Death Sentence&amp;rsquo; to the sparkling imagery in poems such as &amp;lsquo;Kiosk&amp;rsquo;, where the tide/tucks its brooms and mops/and cloths/under its soapy arms/shoulders its load of dirty water/and returns to the sea, this poetry collection is full of whimsical twists and turns, rich imagery and keen observations by one of SA&amp;rsquo;s most loved poets.&amp;#39; &amp;ndash; Jude Aquilina&lt;/p&gt;" />
