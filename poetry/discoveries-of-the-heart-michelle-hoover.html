Full of poems that are truly from her heart, these creations offer pleasure and solace to you as they have to her. 
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Tear Drops&lt;/b&gt;
I think of you with love in my heart
Its been several years since your depart
The dozen deep red roses placed near you
Now have tear drops from the morning dew
I think of you and what has happened
You wouldnt recognize how lifes changed
People have moved on not looking back
Addresses and phone numbers I lack
I think of you and know youre happy
Missing loved ones, friends and family
Looking down and making the sun shine
When youre sad your tear drops fall like rain
I think of you and all thats transpired
For me very little has changed
Im writing to say Im doing fine
A shame we cant share a glass of wine
For Christine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;" />
