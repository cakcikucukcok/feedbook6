  <title>Thoughts of Inspiration - Jerry LaVon Lowery</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We all need places to inspire us and promote contemplation. For some, its somewhere on or near the water. Others can find that spot in the middle of a big city. Gardens, mountains, and even shopping malls can provide inspiration and peace of mind. It all depends on what holds meaning for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Jerry LaVon Lowery finds his inspiration in nature. Lowery shares his love of nature in &lt;i&gt;Thoughts of Inspiration: A Collection of Poems&lt;/i&gt;. His poetry focuses on his real-life experiences during his many travels. They deal with conservation, tragedy, loss, and love. The vivid imagery of nature and reverent tone of this work transport you into the wild, amid lush forests, expansive plains, and wild animals all around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lowerys desire to learn from and preserve the natural world shine through the collection of poems gathered in &lt;i&gt;Thoughts of Inspiration: A Collection of Poems&lt;/i&gt;. They inspire awe and the freedom to feel the depths of your emotions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
