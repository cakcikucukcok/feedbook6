  <title>Reflections, Laughter, Meditations - Lilia Westmore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Reflection is how our thoughts examine the differences and similarities between our past and our present. We scrutinize our actions/reactions and try to understand how and why we choose one method from another, to resolve questions of priorities. We think back in time and focus upon issues that affect our decisions. We reflect to justify our choices, and to rationalize the steps we have taken to reach a solution to a puzzle. We reflect because we are human beings.
According to the writer, Arnold Glasow, laughter is &quot;A tranquiliser with no side effects&quot;.
Another writer, Patricia Nelson, call laughter &quot;A noisy smile&quot;. Still another writer, Steven Goldberg, says laughter is &quot;A universal bond that draws all men closer&quot;. The saying, laughter is good for the soul, is a popular quote we hear in our everyday life. Laughter gives us a feeling of goodness that translates into actions of kindness, generosity, and philanthrophy. Laugher is our way of easing problems that beset us, and thereby see clearly the solution that escaped us. When we laugh, we give ourselves a chance to contemplate, understand, and take steps to solve difficulties. We laugh when we are embarrassed. We laugh at silly situations. We laugh at ourselves, proving that we are as human as anybody else.
We meditate deeply into our thoughts, to contemplate, to ponder whether or not we have chosen the right action to resolve problems. We deliberate over dilemmas, choosing, we hope, is the right way out of a predicament. We learn to solve arithmetical problems. We dream, we fantasize and imagine greater things to happen. We aim for a future life, the dream our life, and we take much pleasure in aspiring for it and finally accomplishing the dream into reality. We build castles in the air that seem impossible to fulfill but if we push to become an architect, then we go on to build that castle of our dream. We desire to become a judge in a high court and our chance of one day being one is as attainable as going to college and graduating. Our meditations become our dreams, our reflections, and our laughter." />
