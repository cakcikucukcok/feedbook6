  <title>Just Enough Light to Follow - Laurie Johnson-Krueger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;God wants us to hold His hand and stay on His path; the path that leads us to our destiny. God will reveal Himself and His directions to His children, but we must quiet our minds. He may use scriptures, books, things of nature, insight from friends, etc. He will reveal Himself in a very personal way with each of us. We need to pay attention and trust in Him above all things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He truly loves each one of us and wants us to live a blessed life. He wants us also to bless others with our lives. That is why I am sharing these poems and messages with you. I am an ordinary person with faults and challenges in my life. However, I have always desired to feel Gods presence and live my life according to His will. He reveals Himself to me often, not because Im special, but because I value the relationship with Him more than anything or anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please open your heart to God also, live your life to its fullest with Him as your Father and guide. He will provide, Just Enough Light to Follow.&lt;/p&gt;" />
