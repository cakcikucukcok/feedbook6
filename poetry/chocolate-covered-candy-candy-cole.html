  <title>Chocolate Covered Candy - Candy Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Somebody asked my why did you or why do you write?   Well in my prologue I explained what I saw and tried to imitate because I just had to do something to make myself feel better about what  I actually thought about my living circumstances and life.  In childhood and in most of my life I had  scars and secretes, conflicts in my relationships.  I had to find a way to let my true self come out   without being knocked out all the time..so while people in the house or school played or just sleptI had my dreams and fantasies and desires and I just wanted to speak up and out.  I use  to want to be a DJ cause I loved music   loved to see people dance and sing  on the Ed Sullivan show..but I never got the opportunity because of my real life responsibilities .                
I felt hurt and had too many  secretes and not enough positive  support.  So Chocolate Covered Candy was a band aid  to stop me from bleeding  when I felt I was pouring out blood.  Stopped me from being a dope fiend too I guess.
It was a life saver  and companionship when I felt ostracized and  nasty and alone.
It was foot steps in the sand for me to see when I was not feeling like walking in this life no more.
For you I just hope it is good and entertaining for your readnot everybody knows embarrassment, poverty, molestation and  childhood  depression.  Some people dont even know about living single with childrenand addictions that come.  You wont learn it  all through my words  but you can become more  understanding to that life  after experiencing the thoughts of  one of its participants.  I pray." />
