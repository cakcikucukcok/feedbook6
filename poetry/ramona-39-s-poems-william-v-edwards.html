  <title>Ramona&#39;s Poems - William V Edwards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume is a presentation of love poems written by the author in response to the absence of his love. Upon his loves return to her homeland in order to complete her studies, the author felt strongly compelled to pen deeply emotional poetry in an attempt to express both his intense love for her, and his own sorrow at her absence.
Upon reading the poems, one clearly begins to discern that they convey a range of different moods. Some are a joyful celebration of Ramonas beauty; some are a lamentation of her absence; one or two even show indignation at what the author deems to be the unfair treatment directed towards him. In spite of this wide array of moods conveyed by the author, it is abundantly clear that these poems are borne out of an intense love for Ramonaa love often tinged with pain.
Before publishing this volume, the author commissioned a traditional hand bound copy of these poems as a personal gift to Ramona, the woman who inspired them." />
