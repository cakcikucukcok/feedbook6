Mr.Simmons served as a naval officer during the Korean War, and since 1958 he has been a practicing lawyer in Los Angeles. Mr.Simmons has been Certified as a Specialist in Taxation and also in Estate Planning, Trusts, and Probate. He has written and lectured nationally on Tax and Estate Planning for the wealthy. His legal practice, he says with some embarrass-ment, involves specializing in fine print and loopholes, and has, sadly, only served to make rich men much richer and myself rich in the process. His poetry, which he thinks of as an escape from his real work has been 
published in national magazines.&lt;/p&gt;" />
