  <title>Last Call - Cb Fairchild, Stacy Baer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I started writing poetry in the mid 70s. I couldnt play guitar
or sing (the nuns kicked my out of the choirsaid I sounded
like a bleating goat). So I figured poetry would help with the
chicks. But then I found that I liked poetry and putting down
my thoughts on paper, it helped me keep my inner demons at
bay. So write I did.
Then I joined the navy and got married, had children and the
writing was put on the shelf. I wasnt until I divorced and the
kids were grown, that I found my inspiration again and started
putting pen to paper (well type to computer).
As I looked through this conglomeration of poems, I could
see a pattern taking shapethe pattern of random purpose.
Many of these poems were written for lovers, friends, family
but mostly for me. And many years passed from early works in
my teens to more recent works that may be less cynicalBut
whatever the case, whether funny, romantic, political or dark
they are all written from the heart and from the experiences of
a middle-aged hippie
As you read these poems please remember that
Poets write not from wisdom but from inspiration
CB Fairchild
I hope you enjoy my rambling thoughts as much as I enjoyed
writing them. PEACE" />
