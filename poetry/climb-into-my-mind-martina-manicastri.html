  <title>Climb into My Mind - Martina Manicastri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Climb into My Mind&lt;/i&gt; is a book jam-packed with poems, essays, and short stories. The topics addressed are those that pertain to school life, political and social issues, family and love. Meandering through the maze that is my mind I present a different perspective on how I, as a teenager, look at the way situations unfold and how they affect me. This is not quite a typical book, yet it is easy to relate to as you find comfort in knowing that you are not alone in the world. The section, What I See in the Mirror, is an introspection of my deepest
feelings. Undoubtedly, we all experience bad and depressing times in our lives. We often feel as if no one understands what we are going through, but I hope the poem themes in this section will create a connection with you.&lt;/p&gt;
While some of the poems tackle both pleasant and unpleasant experiences, the stories introduce you to new characters, which bring an imaginative and lively angle to the world around us with a bit of a twist. A few of the stories and poems are funny, whereas others are more serious as they deal with political events and social awareness bringing different perspectives to controversial topics such as gay marriage and teen pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
My hope is that this book comforts, intrigues, captivates, and amuses you. So what are you waiting for, grab a ladder and climb into my mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;My Voice&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I feel the tattoos on my back sting, but I know that one more scar wouldnt change the memory it has left behind. With no reason to live, I feel ready to take that final step. I rise from my spot and give my fingers a break. I glance down at the tobacco leaves I have picked, knowing I am not allowed to stop. But why should I care? I have no voice, I serve no purpose. I am just a slave. I stand still looking in his eyes full of hate. He whips out his weapon as I begin to walk away from my work area. I never turn my head as he yells for me to turn back. I keep marching at a steady pace until I see beyond the fields a man of my kind with a voice -- a voice that is strong, that is making others listen; a voice that has power, and speaks only for change. This makes me turn around and sit back down, knowing my voice wont take long to be heard.&lt;/i&gt;" />
