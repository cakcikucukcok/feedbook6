  <title>The Equilibrist - Erasmus Cromwell-Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Erasmus Cromwell-Smith II&amp;#39;s magical, modern-day literary tale, an ailing professor journeys into his past to reveal a world ensconced in stories and poetry, with the hope of imparting inspirational, lifelong lessons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From his crumpled aesthetic of a tweed jacket or cardigan to his thick British accent, Professor Erasmus Cromwell-Smith is the embodiment of the prestigious New England scholastic institute where he teaches. But at 64, with a sudden diagnosis of incurable brain cancer, he decides to focus his intentions on living each day to the fullest and to share a lifetime of wisdom that he&amp;#39;s treasured throughout the years. In daily classes with an ever-increasing audience, the professor mesmerizes students with tales of a childhood surrounded by rare books and enhanced by his friendships with three colorful, eclectic antiquarian mentors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through an unfolding of conversation, free-verse poetry, and letters, the mentors&amp;rsquo; tutelage is revealed. For example, the title poem serves as a message about balance and freedom, while &amp;quot;The Magic in Life&amp;quot; poses questions about where enchantment exists, &amp;quot; ... a piece of art?/ ...a magnificent meal?/ ...within the silence and peace of contemplation and meditation?&amp;quot; Over 30 thought-provoking poems and reflections are woven throughout, addressing such concepts as letting go of the past, finding inspiration, dealing with loss, and ultimately living a happy, blissful life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The writing style is thoroughly fluid and engaging, with a nice narrative changeup, as chapters often switch from the third person as the eccentric professor ponders his way to class, to the first- person storytelling of his lectures that easily draws in students (and readers).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is also a story about love. With only a few hints regarding a curious young blonde-haired woman attending his class, the professor&amp;#39;s legacy is ultimately brought to a surprising, honored conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story&amp;rsquo;s premise recalls Randy Pausch&amp;#39;s popular memoir, The Last Lecture, yet this existential &amp;quot;final session&amp;quot; harbors a quiet magical quality all its own. In choosing to explore universal concerns within a captivating fictional realm, Cromwell-Smith II strikes an ideal balance for his storytelling.&lt;/p&gt;" />
