  <title>More Than a Memory - Carol J. Grace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Carol Grace&#39;s first book, &quot;Reflections of a life well spent&quot; was autobiographical in nature, while &quot;More than a Memory&quot; is more diverse, including poems of nature, poems written as a tribute to others, and poems of faith and inspiration.&lt;p&gt; 
Mrs. Grace says this about her newest collection of poems: &lt;p&gt;
&quot;More than a Memory&quot; deals with everyday observations and the simple joy of letting words spill from my thoughts and onto paper. I have had a love affair with words all of my life. Poetry happens when thought becomes image, image becomes word, and words join together to form meaning that is often unique to each reader. It is my hope that &quot;More Than a Memory&quot; will trigger your own fond memories, and moreover, that you would be encouraged, if not challenged, to continue to make new memories, not letting the days get away from you.&quot; &lt;p&gt;
&quot;More than a Memory&quot; is not a book for the literary few, but for everyone who loves to hear a good story. Poetry has the ability to convey an entire story with an economy of words. You might find yourself reading the entire book in one sitting, but more likely you will read just a few poems at a time, luxuriating over the way the words make you feel. Although the subject matter may be bleak, the poem can still be beautiful because of word choice and the way it sounds when read aloud.&lt;p&gt; 
Carol&#39;s poetry is written with the knowledge that there is power in the word, and we must learn to choose our words wisely. May the words in &quot;More than a Memory&quot; inspire you, bring a laugh or two, and comfort you." />
