  <title>Darling Last Time - Samantha Friello</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Darling Last Time&lt;/I&gt; is a poetry book based on one woman&#39;s perspective of the many trials and tribulations experienced through living life. This work entails words of great courage and beauty, bringing a sense of conviction and honesty to readers; male or female, aging from the late teens and on up.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Darling Last Time&lt;/I&gt; entails the emotions experienced, as if on a timeline, through healing from physical illness, transitions which occur mentally and physically after the break-up or at the start of a new relationship(s), starting a new life, or gathering the hope and perseverance it takes to go on; despite numerous obstacles we may face in our lives.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Darling Last Time&lt;/I&gt; also exhibits a rare sense of humor, found in poems about your &quot;normal&quot; working day, housewives and their duties at home, fast food and the grand holiday experience!&lt;p&gt;
&lt;I&gt;Darling Last Time&lt;/I&gt; depicts the fashionably funny side of everyday events experienced by everyone. So, read on to experience a roller coaster ride; the towering highs and plummeting lows involved in life. Oh, and don&#39;t forget, there&#39;s a few laughs in there, too!" />
