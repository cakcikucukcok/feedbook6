  <title>Kookaburra Cackle Kangaroo Scat - Philip L.  Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It was early last December, as near as I can remember, I was walking down the street slightly tipsyfied. No one was I disturbing as I sat down by the kerbing, and a pig came up and sat down by my side. As I sat there in the gutter, thinking thoughts I could not utter, a lady passing by was heard to say. &#39;You can tell someone who boozes by the company he chooses,&#39; and the pig got up and slowly walked away. Exploring a wide range of subjects with the lyric wit of his poetry, Philip Carroll delivers a delightful read that has universal appeal. Stories of powerful emotions and human passions are woven into whimsical reflections, providing a depth of subject in a highly enjoyable style. Kookaburra Cackle Kangaroo Scat is an entertaining book that challenges the conventions of storytelling." />
