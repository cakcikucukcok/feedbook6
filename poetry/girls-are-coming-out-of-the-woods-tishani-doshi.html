  <title>Girls Are Coming Out of the Woods - Tishani Doshi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Girls Are Coming Out of the Woods is Tishani Doshi&#39;s third book of poems, following two earlier, highly praised collections, Everything Belongs Elsewhere, published by Bloodaxe in 2012, and her debut, Countries of the Body, winner of the Forward Prize for best first collection. In Girls are Coming out of the Woods, Tishani Doshi combines artistic elegance with a visceral power to create a breathtaking panorama of danger, memory, beauty and the strange geographies of happiness. This is essential, immediate, urgent work and Doshi is that rare thing, an unashamed visionary who knows that, &quot;while you and I go on with life / remembering and forgetting, / the poets remain: singing, singing&quot;.&#39; – John Burnside. &#39;I admire these poems because they are masterly formal inventions. But I return to them, again and again, for the elegy and the urgency and the prophecy. I want to give this book to the people I love, and say to them, memorize this, never forget.&#39; – Jeet Thayil. &#39;These are powerful haunting poems about rain, death, poetry and love, with the sea pounding unrelentingly in the background. Whether it is about discovering one’s first white hairs or an ode to Patrick Swayze, about seeking ways to surrender &quot;sun-scarred lives&quot; to the tidal dark or to welcome &quot;orphaned slippers, Styrofoam, fossil of crab&quot; washed up by the insomniac ocean, these poems welcome the wildly assorted flotsam of daily detail and transmute them into the greater strangeness of poetry. Elegiac and fevered, Tishani Doshi’s poems search for ways to make their peace with tide and temporality, with fragility and violence, even as they celebrate that there is really &quot;no end to unknowing&quot;.&#39; – Arundhathi Subramaniam." />
