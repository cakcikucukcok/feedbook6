  <title>Circling Round Woman - Arlene Corwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Generally speaking, my collections &#39;circle&#39; around something, providing me with a wide berth for treatment. So with the exception of the few things of which I have more certainty, as in my collections &lt;i&gt;A Sense of The Ridiculous&#39;&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;I Is Always You Is Me.&lt;/i&gt;--certainties which don&#39;t need a prefix verb, the subject of woman demands circling around it. &#39;Woman&#39; means half the planetary population. I would hope to reach all ages but I suspect that this particular collection will speak most to the mature woman, the woman who has begun to notice her aging processes.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As in &lt;i&gt;To The Child Mystic (Authorhouse), &lt;b&gt;Circling Round Woman&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is an unintentional memoir-cum-instruction book in poetic form: sharply observational, pragmatic, personal; nonchalantly, funnily and unscientifically scientific. Women friends of the author have commented that some of the poems have changed their lives, they being able to identify themselves with the theme. &quot;When you can identify with a thing, you feel its universality and you feel accepted&quot;, say Ms Corwin.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Circling Round Woman&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is concrete; easy reading, deep reading; philosophical and playful all at once. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Circling Round Woman&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; makes you laugh, cry and remember. It reminds you of who you are and what you are becoming." />
