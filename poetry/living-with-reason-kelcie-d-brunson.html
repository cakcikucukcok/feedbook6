  <title>Living with Reason - Kelcie D. Brunson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is constantly changing and over time it brings about a change in each of us. Living With Reason epitomizes this evolution of the spirit which occurs simply by living and going through experiences, both good and bad. Although the good tend to be more in demand, it is the tough situations that highlight our true character and develops us with each encounter.  
  	As we grow and try to figure this thing out, we learn to accept that we are going to make mistakes on this journey and that is okay.  With time we become powerful enough to love ourselves where we are and know that the difficult experiences are setting the stage for what is to come. Living With Reason is a journey of taking ownership of self and knowing that we have a purpose in this life. And, that purpose is a great one. Furthermore, we aspire to accept things for what they are now and know that with each day there is so much more to come." />
