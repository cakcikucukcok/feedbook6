  <title>Wild Roses and Others - Clara Mellor, Bethany Mellor, Emily Mellor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Wild Roses
You ask for wild roses
and I give you the moor.
Wild is the moorland,
barren and bleak and cold
and the trailing,
despairing cry of the curlew
lingers long in the air ...
Clara Mellor
In a posthumous collection of poems, Clara Mellor shares a lyrical look into thirty-five years of life as she attempted to balance a need for personal fulfillment with her duties as a wife and mother.
Clara knew more than anyone that anguish has the capability of producing its own peculiar note of music. In poems created from alienation, Clara intertwines the beauty found in nature with the thoughts of an independent woman battling conformity, the grey shadows that hover over a world reluctant to awaken to the dull dread of a new day, a whisper that hints God may be dead, the heartbreaking loss of true love, and mans self-indulgence as he turns in fear to those who lead.
Wild Roses and Others shares poems that reflect on one womans poignant and liberating journey through the twentieth century as she searched for answersand the truth." />
