  <title>The Memories That We Leave Behind - Ronald Black</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Within our lives we feel happiness, sorrow and pain, sometimes even all at once.
There are many times when we do not understand the way that we feel. There are times when we want to strengthen the relationships in the lives that we live but pride is what we still feel. 
Sometimes we are breaking apart even when it is very painful in our hearts. 
Sometimes we would whether live with misery than reconcile with the ones that we love.
There will always be mistakes made in the lives that we live. We need to work pass the problems in our lives to find a solution. I know that we can still feel hurt but we can overcome the feeling when we look deeply into our hearts. There will always be a love that we will feel for the ones that we love. Accepting this is the one true constant that can strengthen our relationships. I hope that with the reading of this poetry you will be given an insight. We do not live in a perfect world, but we are a diamond or a pearl.
We are all special in our own ways. We all deserve to be loved every day." />
