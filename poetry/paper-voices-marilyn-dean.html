  <title>Paper Voices - Marilyn Dean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="PAPER VOICES
From the pages of my varied experiences, I speak to you, Ladies, not from the heart of a bosom but from the heart of my seasoned soul.  Hence, the title, Paper Voices, accurately reflects my mode of sharing life, life with its dueling dynamics of simplicity versus complexity, life as it presents itself to us, as women.   In Paper Voices we will share the good, the bad, the not so good and the downright ridiculous.  We will laugh together and cry together.  We will be Sisters in the most refined sense of the word.
Some of you may wonder why Marilyn; why read from her pages; why listen to her voice?   I ask, Ladies, why not me?  Why not from a baby boomer who is gingerly sprinting into her sixth decade of life?  Why not reap the benefits of seeds sown by a seasoned Sister who has mastered the art of listening, a woman wise enough to listen to God first, foremost and always?
Ive been a child and an adult/a mother and a wife/a loyal lover, a faithful friend/ and a helping and watchful neighbor.  Ive been victim and victor/suffered ups and downs/Ive run cold and hot/and Ive been right and Ive been wrong.  I have a style of humor that can only be described as unique.  Again, Ladies, why not me?
Ive tried to accentuate the positive and minimize the negative.  Im far from perfect; Im a multi-flawed me.   And, although I have affected some bad choices, I made the good decision to live a humble and Godly life, a life in which I believe God is pleased.  Why me, Ladies?  Because the favor of the Lord says so.   It was with favor that I received the words for Paper Voices, and it is with confidence in their truths and wisdom that I believe its Gods Will that you too will be blessed.  
Now, Ladies, lets have at it.  Paper Voices: From the page to the heart  unabashedly saying this, that, the other and more.   Paper Voices:  Its all about us, all about the commonalities of our richly diverse lives.
Well meet again at the end of the journey." />
