  <title>Wounded Healer - Brenda Haynes Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Wounded Healer is a release of lyrical Psalms and poetry penned by Brown since her youth. She has recorded her questions, sentiments and perceptions that reflect a variety of personal life experiences and dealings with God.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;Written in times of doubt, repentance, and trials, these Psalms are to hold close to the heart, as a &quot;gift&quot;, while Child and Father are &quot;working things out&quot;. They will serve as a personal lifeline and spiritual compass for those navigating their own infinite journeys.&lt;/P&gt; 
&lt;P&gt;The Psalms are simplistic and flow from a heart who undeniably knows God in a deeply personal way. Soothing and calming, yet gutsy and raw, her lyrics flow from a tested, yet passionate, relationship with the Lord.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Psalms are shared in poetry form, without their melody; for in their message lies the Hope and Power.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Brown did not compose these Psalms and poems as entertainment or for any great literary value. They are simply &quot;Bread&quot;, multiplied and served from the leftover fragments of the broken pieces of her own insightful walk with Jesus.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;These Psalms and spiritual songs stir us with hope that no matter how painful our circumstances or how tearstained our pillows, ultimately, Joy will come in the morning!&lt;/P&gt;" />
