  <title>Dark Days - Joseph J. Capriccioso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Loss of Ways and Dark Days go hand in hand. Always were the
two books connected since Sorrow of Separation. Your Dark Days are born as you return home to find your life snatched away. Your sons were only two years and two months old. Marriage was just around the corner for you.Life was good as you looked forward to a future of happily ever after.The future died as you ran up your steps. You open your door to the loudest silence you could hear. Shock choked your vocal cords. Pure fear of not knowing where they could be. The truth was soon revealed that you didnt want to accept. She had an
affair and ran away with no intent to return.Your true love tossed you out without giving you a choice. She took your future with her in the form of your sons.
&lt;p&gt;Can you survive being erased from existence? Her tales are told
where you dont exist or matter. You are blocked from your kids
day-to-day life, and a new world is constructed without you. No one
knows who you are, and you must fight to be seen. You must prove
yourself and battle for your kids.
A father does have a say and should never be turned into a
stranger.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;These are the &lt;i&gt;Dark Days &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br&gt;________________________________
&lt;p&gt;Imagine a world where you have no say. Robbed of your family
youre made to pay. Forever falling with no end in sight. Health
declines leaving you frail and light. Cries of children will end your
dread. You are dying but are not dead. This future cannot be. You
must fight for family. Survive past your &lt;i&gt;Loss of Ways&lt;/i&gt; for these are the &lt;i&gt;Dark Days&lt;/i&gt;. Evil may storm your weather, but you must never give up, never.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt; Dark Days is the 8th book in the
