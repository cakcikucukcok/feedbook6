  <title>Bond of the Day - Betty Mephors</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Betty Mephors is a Novelist, Poet, Playwright, Gospel Song Writer and Singer, and an Educator. 
She obtained Bachelors Degrees in English language and also in Liberal Arts Studies from California State University Dominguez Hills, California. She obtained Masters Degrees in Special Education- Mild/ Moderate and Moderate/Severe Disabilities from National University, Jolla, California. She also obtained Teaching Credentials in all the above fields of study. She is looking forward to pursuing her Doctorate Degrees because she believes in the power of education.
      Betty Mephors is a Published Poet with the American Poetry Anthology-1985, an Award Winning Poet with A View From the Edge Publications-1987, an Award Winning Speaker- People Who Care Youth Center in Los Angeles California-1990, and also an Award Winning Artist- American Society Of Composers and Authors -1994. Betty Mephors has also published in her local church bulletin at Saint Brigid Catholic church in Los Angeles, California, in the United States of America.
       Betty Mephors describes herself as a Hard Core, Die hard, God lover, who has defied the Seven Headed Dragon and the Brazen Serpent himself. She also describes herself as The Saint who Breathes Life while walking the Very Jaws of Death.
       Her message: If we as grown people never gave a thought to the essence of our lives, we have not intentionally lived. To live is to love and to love is to live; for that is the very human essence, that peace, love, truth and justice, which liberates, which resurrects and which transcends eternity. Whereas the soul is the issue of Agape (Filial Love), let us therefore, seed our genetic facts in accumulation of our now acts. I wish you all fair play in the ball of this universe, and so, thrive!" />
