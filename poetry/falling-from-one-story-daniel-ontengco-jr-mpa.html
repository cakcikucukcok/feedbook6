  <title>Falling from One Story - Daniel Ontengco Jr., Mpa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Falling from One Story is a collection of one hundred individual poems followed by a long form poem/short story.  The poems inform the story and the story informs the poems.  As many stories fall into one, one story falls into many.  The poems and story touch on many, many subjects but share a common thread of searching and of hard traveling.  The man who is at the center of much of the material is falling from one story but is hoping to land on his feet.  Its not too far down after all.  He knows that in order to restore himself to health he has to gather up all of his strength as well as all of his weakness and head out into the limitless unknown.  For if he can successfully trek past the immense wilderness ahead of him there may be something enlightening and wonderful waiting for him way over the ridge." />
