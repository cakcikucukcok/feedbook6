  <title>A Surrendered Soul, Like Water - L.L Culpepper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A full range of human emotion and experience is captured beautifully and poignantly in L.L. Culpeppers debut book of poetry &lt;i&gt;A Surrendered Soul, Like Water&lt;/i&gt;. As a writer, Culpepper uses her words to bring meaningful expression to the often indescribable ruminations of the heart and to the hardships we encounter along lifes journey. And whether she is mining the depths of despair, reminding us of the fragility of life, or speaking of surrender and salvation, she does so with the utmost sensitivity, using her carefully chosen words to bring clarity and comfort. The scriptures that accompany many of the poems provide a spiritual context to the poets contemplations, and offer a hopeful perspective on how God works patiently through our struggles, confusion, hurts, fears, and even failures to create purpose and new beginnings. In &lt;i&gt;A Surrendered Soul, Like Water&lt;/i&gt; Culpepper has accomplished the aim of many poets and artists: to express deeply personal thoughts and experiences in a universal way that reaches other human beings. Its the kind of poetry you will find yourself returning to repeatedly, sharing with others, and relating to in new and profound ways at various seasons of your life.
