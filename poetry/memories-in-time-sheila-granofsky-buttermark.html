&lt;em&gt;Memories in Time tells of poignant, real life situations&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
OAK POINT, Texas  Sheila Granofsky Buttermark marks her debut in the literary limelight with the release of Memories in Time (&lt;span style=&quot;color:#0000FF;&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;published by Xlibris&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), a poetry collection presenting her own journey that will inspire and influence readers to have a different outlook on life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Buttermark writes of the memories of events in her life that are both good and not so good. Memories in Time shares words that tell of desire, despair, hope and deep love, along with episodes of feelings as being deliberately hurt and asking for forgiveness for her past deeds. I feel as I was meant to write these words so people could see there are several paths in life that one can take, the author says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Recovering from a heart problem, a near-death experience, going back 17-plus years. While looking through a window I saw the beauty of life, and remembered the many things that inspired me to write the words I felt, Buttermark on her inspiration in penning her debut book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: justify;&quot;&gt;Some of the situations in the book can, in reality, apply to anyone. It will appeal to anyone because its the episodes in life; the reading suggests what can and does occur in ones lifetime, Buttermark says. I want readers to have an understanding of lifes happenings, so they can share their lives with others.&lt;/p&gt;
