  <title>The Jumping of the Braids - Reem Hisham Hijjawi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    The book consists of thirty-six poems. It talks about love in many different facets. It talks about love for God, nature, between men and women, people,
    love to improve life . . . and so forth.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    The book also tackles the problem of dictatorship, especially in the Middle East. It describes the oppression inflicted on the people and their sufferings.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Some poems have a Sufi attribute. When they are directed toward a lover, one can feel and conclude that God is the one meant to be.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Light pleasance can be felt when reading some poems, while other poems can be haunting and disturbing. It is poems like The Dead Sea and The Blob that
    crack us up laughing, and poems like Its Cleaning Time and Passion in the Cave that make us wonder why the tyrants do not learn a lesson from history and
    improve people&#39;s lives.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Your Honor is a poem that uses symbolism to talk about the history of the Palestinian people who were farmers bombarded by Zionism.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    In general, the book talks about universal issues that touch all humans in general. It talks about the human weakness in adhering to God&#39;s commands,
    &lt;br/&gt;
    when adversity debilitates confidence and causes commotion in the heart and soul. But we do not despair, we pick up from where we were interrupted
    &lt;br/&gt;
    and we keep on walking the path we were meant to follow.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    This book combines the East and the West. It is written in English language, but the eastern mentality and way of thinking gave it a special aroma. It is
    &lt;br/&gt;
    not always that people see life from the same perspective, how about when it is written by a woman who is originally an Arab but absorbed and lived the
    &lt;br/&gt;
    western way and adopted it.
