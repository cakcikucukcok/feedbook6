  <title>The Abcs of Tbi - Alex M. Scheer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The ABCs of TBI&lt;/i&gt; (Traumatic Brain Injury) is a collection of poems chronicling the life, challenges, and random thoughts of author Alex Schreer, a person living with a traumatic brain injury. Presented in alphabetical order, this compilation offers two poems for each letter of the alphabet. The poems are arranged with a disciplined approach to rhythm and rhyme that has helped Schreer peer through the fog of his injury and come up with a clearer understanding of what it takes to deal with a life-altering accident.&lt;/p&gt;  
Schreer was encouraged by these words by Wendell Barry, I have been wakeful at night, and words have come to me out of their deep caves needing to be remembered. He fervently hopes that his words will illuminate the pathway to recovery for TBI victims and their families through poetry. This very personal collection seeks to provide a better understanding of living life with a traumatic brain injury.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;No matter where or with whom&lt;/br&gt;
	Tears are constantly falling&lt;/br&gt;
Which signifies gloom and doom&lt;/br&gt;
	With only sorrow to bring.&lt;/p&gt;
And so the sadness is brought&lt;/br&gt;
	Rarely, good eer comes from it&lt;/br&gt;
Try and try, they cannot be caught&lt;/br&gt;
	To have a fire, must get lit &lt;/i&gt;" />
