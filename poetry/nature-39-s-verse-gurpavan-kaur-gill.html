  <title>Nature&#39;s Verse - Gurpavan Kaur Gill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Life as we know it seems to be underpinned on electrical energy. &lt;br /&gt;Live without it for 2 days and everything unravels. You cannot&lt;br /&gt;work, meet deadlines, shop, store or feed yourself.&lt;br /&gt;--Suhasini Ayer, Auroville, Pondicherry, India&lt;br /&gt;This book describes global natural and cultural biodiversity and the way to unite individuals from various backgrounds through collaboration, natural restoration and peaceful co-existence. It explores Asian culture and economic growth, particularly in India, to promote equality within the Indian social order through a paradigm shift--building a society based on mutual well-being rather than caste distinction. India and the world has the potential to grow and expand in a profoundly sustainable and positive socioeconomic manner. Juxtaposing nature and our human world, this book reveals the parallels found between the worlds of nature and humanity. Learning from the symmetry and harmony of nature, humanity too can co-exist in a peaceful and positive way through the process of symbiosis.&lt;br /&gt;Pavan Gills manuscript addresses two of the most pressing issues of our time: inequality and human security. Her...insightful and well-researched work on ecological biodiversity and environmental harmony in India is both creative and original.&lt;br /&gt;Professor Gordon Smith -Executive Director of the Centre for Global Studies-Distinguished Fellow at the Centre for international Governance Innovation (CIGI), and Adjunct Professor of Political Science and Public Administration at the University of Victoria&lt;/p&gt;" />
