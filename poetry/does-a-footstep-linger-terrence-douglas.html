  <title>Does a Footstep Linger? - Terrence Douglas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Douglas&#39; words conjure up images - like an artist brushing dabs of paint on the canvas of ones mind - all senses forced to come alive for a truly amazing experience. These are poems that will stir the heart and continue to resonate with each reading. &quot;&lt;br&gt;
 Gary R. Indianapolis&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Muscular and lyrical, sensuous and deeply spiritual, the poetry of Terry Douglas probes the heart&#39;s longing for love and union with the beloved and the soul&#39;s quest for grace and oneness with the divine. Even those who don&#39;t read poetry will find much here that resonates in the heart and awakens the soul.&quot; &lt;br&gt;
Evan A., Virginia Beach, VA&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Does a Footstep Linger?&lt;/i&gt; explores the fire of love found at any age and in any season, and the stunning grief from love lost. There are poems in the collection that seek the Creators presence
and spiritual nourishment in all aspects of lifes journey. An exuberance and energy unfold in the poems as we are encouraged to dance in celebration, as if no one is watching, leaving
behind past regrets and no longer anxious of the future. Above all else, the poet probes the many mysteries and miracles  some would say coincidences  encountered daily in a long life of love.&lt;p&gt;
For inspiration, the poet pauses to contemplate a sunrise on the ocean or a star-filled canopy overhead; he walks on an isolated beach in a blustery rain storm, or sits perched on a deck overlooking a canal as the water rushes into the bay, or in a coffee shop amidst the turmoil of another day." />
