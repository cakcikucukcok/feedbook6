  <title>Modern Day Psalmist - Daniel Carroll</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am blessed to see that God has enabled Daniel to write his fifth book.  Daniels poetry has been a source of inspiration for me and others for many years.  On several occasions, I have received a poem on a Sunday evening which the Lord inspired Daniel to write during one of my sermons.  I am always amazed at his uncanny ability to compile the words and pen the thoughts that capture the essence of what others are feeling, but find it difficult to say. 
I have known Daniel since the day he gave his life to Jesus Christ, and I have seen God truly transform his life.  He has overcome a myriad of obstacles and continues to press toward the mark for the prize of  the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.  His writings are a reflection of the narrow and difficult road he has traveled toward the abundant life which Christ died to give him.  As you read this book, I hope that you will be as inspired, empowered and encouraged to overcome every obstacle life brings your way, and to live your life completely for Christ.
Alfred D. Watts" />
