  <title>The Sister Chronicles and Other Poems - Joyce Nower</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;&lt;p&gt;I arrived at San Diego State University (then State College ) in 1969 and so was present at the creation and watched the events described in Joyce Nowers &lt;/i&gt;The Sister Chronicles&lt;i&gt; unfold. Nower examines and evokes the creation of the first Womens Studies program in the nation with a remarkable intertextual weaving of prose and rather formal verse  And so the reconstruction of history to include her story began, and you will find the triumphs and setbacks, the exhilaration and disappointment, the hope and the struggle of those days powerfully recalled on these pages. Nower even has the audacity to turn bureaucratic academic procedures into poetry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
Fred Moramarco, poet and editor of &lt;i&gt;Poetry International&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The] Sister Chronicles &lt;i&gt;(sharp title) about the formation of the first womens studies in the USA  is entirely original. The prose is nicely paced, but its the poetry that charms this reader, with its lyrical, musical voice, its mix of sassy, down home, traditional and erudite, witty and playful voices (Dido Did It), the somber beauty of On the Path to Athena Proneia, The Danaids . The poems connect smoothly to the narration. The poems that reflect the physical world in San Diego, birds, flora, the back country of the hunterthose Sloan Canyon Songsare strong  I like the witty rhymes  The Meditation on the Maelstrom seems an excellent last poem and lands on an affirming note .I am grateful to know about the mystic, pagan, fourth-century BC mathematician Hypatia of Alexandria. These sonnets, with their no-nonsense earthy language  delighted me. Jericho Again and Again sets a philosophical mode into motion. After the fires, the blood of Hypatia, it offers a quieter tone. I especially like #7 Childhoods Globe of Light, the pleasure of the rhymed couplets.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Colette Inez, poet (&lt;i&gt;The Woman Who Loved Worms, Alive and Taking Names&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Writing in the tradition of the &lt;/i&gt;Iliad&lt;i&gt; and &lt;/i&gt;Odyssey &lt;i&gt;, Joyce Nower charts the stormy waters of the Sixties. Her luminous poetry breaks over the shoals of the past, bringing calm at last.&lt;/i&gt; The Sister Chronicles&lt;i&gt; is a tour de force of history and literature.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
