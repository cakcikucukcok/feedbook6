  <title>To Love Is to Live - Mashael Makhadmi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;To Love Is To Live&lt;/i&gt;is a collection of poems that deeply describes the feelings that love can bring. Love is a roller coaster ride that allows lovers feel moments of sheer joythe feeling that the whole world has stopped, and their love is the only thing that exists.  Hearts beat as one, and the rest of the world is distant, existing far from their emotional core.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet love can also leave someone feeling that their whole life has been shattered; the world has suddenly become a dark, empty space seemingly overnight. The emotions of love cover the spectrum from total bliss to pure misery. These emotions cannot be denied; their strength over the hearts of lovers cannot be ignored. Some may yearn to feel the emotional high that love causes, but are scared to feel the hurt that sometimes comes along with it. Both the joy and the pain, though, are essential to being human. If you have not experienced love, you have not lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOVES CURSE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Loves curse is evil in itself;&lt;br&gt;
It preys on hearts of lovers at a time of weakness,&lt;br&gt;
Like a baby seal in the middle of the ocean.&lt;br&gt;
It seeks the souls of emptiness,&lt;br&gt;
And strikes at their most vulnerable,&lt;br&gt;
Like a hunter who follows its prey &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
