  <title>Celebrate Life - Etta Dachman, Rose Smeenk, Jorge Rivera, Steven Gold...</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A group of seniors, members of a poetry class in Mosholu-Montefiore Senior Center, has created a collection of poems; exciting, humorous, and tender as nature. These poems will make the readers look at life in a different way. The new perspective will be to celebrate life, and invite others to join the feast of fulfillment. Seniors wrote this unique selection of poems, to share their inspiration with others. Their memories are intact, with accuracy in their approach. Their ages range between sixty-two and ninety. Celebrating life is their philosophy of living, transmitting a message in every word of their poems. It is like a rainbow of emotions, each one unique in beauty, and deep in their metaphors and allegories. This book was written to fit the readers of this new millennium, regardless of their age, race, beliefs, gender and social status.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Taking a little time to read these poems releases ones spirit to appreciate things, people and ideas otherwise taken for granted. These poems make us linger on beautiful thoughts, memories and hopes for the bright hours ahead.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Rabbi Eugene S. Katz&lt;br&gt;
Chaplain,&lt;br&gt;
Montefiore Medical Center&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This collection of poems is heartfelt, sweet and funny. The poetry depicts a voice of a certain era and portrays an awareness of the outside world as well as a personal experience.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Robin Lettieri,&lt;br&gt;Library Director&lt;br&gt;Port Chester/Rye Brook&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A truly heartwarming and thought-provoking collection of poems from those who have a lifetime of thoughts and ideas to share.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
