  <title>Search Party - William Matthews, Sebastian Matthews, Stanley Plumly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;From the prize-winning poet: &amp;ldquo;A stunning volume&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;.&amp;#160;A master of the understatement, Matthews is wryly philosophical and self-deprecating.&amp;rdquo; &amp;mdash;&lt;I&gt;Booklist&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR /&gt;&lt;BR /&gt; When William Matthews died, the day after his fifty-fifth birthday, America lost one of its most important poets, one whose humor and wit were balanced by deep emotion, whose off-the-cuff inventiveness belied the acuity of his verse. Drawing from his eleven collections and including twenty-three previously unpublished poems, &lt;I&gt;Search Party&lt;/I&gt; is the essential compilation of this beloved poet&amp;#39;s work. Edited by his son, Sebastian Matthews, and William Matthews&amp;#39;s friend and fellow poet Stanley Plumly (who also introduces the book), Search Party is an excellent introduction to the poet and his glistening riffs on twentieth-century topics from basketball to food to jazz.&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
