  <title>Something of Value - Rawland Storm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The poems within my book have been accumulating over a span of sixty-six years. Perhaps the thoughts, words and feelings were not immediately stored anywhere, except my mind and heart, but eventually they were written down on paper, so I would not forget them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through these poems I have, hopefully, managed to express the Christian feelings and beliefs I have always felt should be shared with others. As I have often said to myself, Words are just words, until they are heard or read by someone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have always written and posted my poems on-line, with only black letters on a white background. No colors, pictures or music to distract the reader; or affect their reaction to my words. I grew-up listening to the lyrics of songs, before music videos began to influence our feelings and thoughts about the words being sung. I liked my mental images much better. I still do. I just want the reader of my words to supply/apply some of their own thoughts, feelings, and images; and in doing so, make each poem their own.&lt;/p&gt;" />
