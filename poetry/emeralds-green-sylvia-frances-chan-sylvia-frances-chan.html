  <title>Emeralds Green - Sylvia Frances Chan, Sylvia Frances Chan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="These poems are about the ordinary man and the unusual. I have conversations in my poems. With the self, my darling, God and oftentimes, I am talking to you too. Love is my most favourite subject. This kind of love, as you can read in my poems, is a unique love. The poems in this book are laden and layered. They are not as simple as they seem, they have to be pondered on. I note in my poems beautiful experiences, but the smallest sad things too, those can be the loveliest. Sad things, we do not display, we keep it deep inside us, even these I want to share with you. People say that poems can heal a soul. My friends say that my poems contain healing words. In what way, better to read them yourself. Life is one exciting event, I assure you. I hope to write more. Wishing you many pleasant hours." />
