  <title>The Optimist: Poems - Joshua Mehigan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Joshua Mehigan&#39;s award-winning poetry, one encounters a lucid, resolute vision driven by an amazing facility with the metrical line. Most of the poems in &lt;em&gt;The Optimist &lt;/em&gt; unapologetically employ traditional poetic technique, and, in each of these, Mehigan stretches the fabric of living language over a framework of regular meter to produce a compelling sonic counterpoint.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Optimist&lt;/em&gt; stares at contemporary darkness visible, a darkly lit tableau that erases the boundary between the world and the perceiving self.   Whether narrative or lyric, dramatic or satirical, Mehigan&#39;s poems explore death, desire, and change with a mixture of reason and compassion.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;In choosing &lt;em&gt;The Optimist&lt;/em&gt; for the Hollis Summers Poetry Prize, final judge James Cummins, wrote:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&quot;The world is given its due in these poems, but its due is the subjective voice making &#39;objective&#39; reality into the reality of art. To do this Mehigan accesses a tradition of voices-the echoes in &lt;em&gt;The Optimist&lt;/em&gt; are, to name a few, of Frost, Robinson, Kees, and Justice; and more in terms of point of view, Bishop and Jarrell-to form with great integrity his own. It isn&#39;t that Mehigan is concerned more with what&#39;s outside himself than inside; nor merely that he travels the highway between the two with such humility and grace. It&#39;s also that these voices, this great tradition, infuses his line with what the best verse, metrical or free, must have: wonder.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
