  <title>The Presence - Rev. V. Jesse Smith, Rev. Dr. Belva Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There will come times in life where you feel like life is a cycle of disappointment after disappointment. You may feel on occasions that every time you take one step forward, something happens in your life to cause you to take two steps backwards. These feelings are real and genuine. They are not to be ashamed of or embarrassed about. 
The Presence reminds you that whatever life brings, you have been designed, fashioned, created, and formed to rise to the occasion. As you read The Presence by stating and restate externally and internally the affirmations and prayers, you will discover that the infinite presence of God is always with you no matter what you are going through. 
The affirmations are designed to remind you of your greatness and what you have been assigned to accomplish in life. The prayers will allow you to go within yourself and communicate with the God of your Creation. The prayers are not designed for you to beg God for anything but to bring forth the promises God made to you in reality.
The Presence will empower you and inspire you, it will rejuvenate you and motivate you, and it will humble you and catapult you. Finally, it will celebrate you and manifest the God within you. Read it with diligence, study it with intensity, and live it deliberately. Even in your darkest hour, The Presence will remind you that God has got your back and God is still in control." />
