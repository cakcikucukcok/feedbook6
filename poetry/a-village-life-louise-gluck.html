  <title>A Village Life - Louise Gluck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A Village Life, Louise Glück&#39;s eleventh collection of poems, begins in the topography of a village, a Mediterranean world of no definite moment or place:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;All the roads in the village unite at the fountain.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Avenue of Liberty, Avenue of the Acacia Trees--&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The fountain rises at the center of the plaza;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;on sunny days, rainbows in the piss of the cherub.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;--from &quot;tributaries&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around the fountain are concentric circles of figures, organized by age and in degrees of distance: fields, a river, and, like the fountain&#39;s opposite, a mountain. Human time superimposed on geologic time, all taken in at a glance, without any undue sensation of speed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Glück has been known as a lyrical and dramatic poet; since Ararat, she has shaped her austere intensities into book-length sequences. Here, for the first time, she speaks as &quot;the type of describing, supervising intelligence found in novels rather than poetry,&quot; as Langdon Hammer has written of her long lines--expansive, fluent, and full--manifesting a calm omniscience. While Glück&#39;s manner is novelistic, she focuses not on action but on pauses and intervals, moments of suspension (rather than suspense), in a dreamlike present tense in which poetic speculation and reflection are possible.&lt;/p&gt;" />
