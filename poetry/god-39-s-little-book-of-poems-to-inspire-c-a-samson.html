  <title>God&#39;s Little Book of Poems to Inspire - C. A. Samson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;English was never one of my favourite subjects at school and until completing this book I had only written a few poems over the last couple of years. Then, at the beginning of summer 2014, I started getting poems in my mind, and I had to write them down. First I would get a title, then the first verse. I would then start to write. At the beginning of each poem, I would never know how the poem would end. Sometimes I had an idea how they would finish. Friends in the church Janet and Jacqueline gave me great support and encouragement to continue this work. At first most poems did not rhyme, then I got the last two lines to rhyme. The Psalms do not rhyme but they are recognised as the best poems ever written. Then the poems started to rhyme. So in the book you will find rhyming, part-rhyming and non-rhyming poems, I hope you like them all...&quot;" />

Samson</i></b> | My favourite Bible story growing up was the tale of Sampson and Delilah (Judges 16). When I saw Ann's photo of The Long Man of Willmington I immediately thought of Samson pushing the pillars of the temple, apart. Therefore, my response to Ann's challenge is this poem "The Pillars of Samson." I hope you enjoy.<br /><b><i>The Pillars of Samson - a Poem | HubPages</i></b> | John K. Samson’s little book of literature is the perfect addition to the library of any fan of Canadian rock band The Weakerthans, but it’s also a marvellous work on its own.<br /><b><i>Lyrics and Poems, 1997-2012: John K. Samson: 9781894037587 ...</i></b> | Samson, legendary Israelite warrior and judge, or divinely inspired leader, renowned for the prodigious strength that he derived from his uncut hair. He is portrayed in the biblical Book of Judges (chapters 13–16).
