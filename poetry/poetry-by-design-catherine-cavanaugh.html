  <title>Poetry by Design - Catherine Cavanaugh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poetry is a way of seeing from the inside out. An idea comes to me in a new and fresh way. Then a word or two gives the ideas a lift, and they take on shape and form. I now have seen the poem, and it starts to speak. The rest is when things unfold. You begin to see the life of the characters and feel each poems distinct rhythm and rhyme. My love for this poetry gives me an ability to see Poetry by Design. The concept flows from my relationship with God. He establishes the thoughts and I sail with Him to a beautiful land of creativity. The book is a good one to share with classes and ladies Bible studies. This book also lends itself to your moments of meditation." />
