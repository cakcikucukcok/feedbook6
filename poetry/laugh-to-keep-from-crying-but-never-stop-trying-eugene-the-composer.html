  <title>Laugh to Keep from Crying but Never Stop Trying - Eugene ?The Composer?</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The majority of the poems incorporated in this book of poetry have been inspired through my association with the former base for poets from the Philadelphia and New Jersey area known as Poetry in the Park. This venue was located inside of Cooper river Park in New Jersey. The group met twice a month and shared poetic ideas, we were like a family, exchanging ideas and encouraging each other as brothers and sisters. 
Our ring leader was Brother Daoud Bey who was Mr. everything, doing anything that need to be done from MC, keeping things in order, providing music, encouragement, food for thought. And a big kind heart.!
Brother Bey was the right hand of Sandra Turner Barnes, Executive Director of Camden County Cultural Heritage Commission. She worked tirelessly to maintain Poetry in The Park for 10 years at the aforementioned location. I was a part of seven of those years at my home away from home. 
We have found another location in a larger better venue, located in the City of Camden, New Jersey a part of The IDEA Center at the Susquehanna Bank Center." />
