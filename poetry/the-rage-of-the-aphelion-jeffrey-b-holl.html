  <title>The Rage of the Aphelion - Jeffrey B. Holl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Rage of the Aphelion  is a collection of poetic works that typify the world as it is within these trying and ever-changing times of economic disparity, and the very glorification of our presence on Earth as we move into the most advanced stage of economic awareness and technological consciousness since the Age of Enlightenment.
Jeffrey B. Holl has captured a certain strength of awareness that does regaleyet vilifyour culture as we show a pronounced reluctance to celebrate the human race within a society more driven by equality that moves to secure a place for each and every being on Earthnot only the chosen few.
While still within a world that struggles to assert its independence from the sources of control that limit future endeavors of the generations that will follow, Jeffrey finds himself transfixed by the very notion of creating works that will compel people to persevere in the struggle to accentuate their own outlook within the notion that life is not a futile endeavoras suchand can be a more formidable attempt at constructing a veritable fortress of thought so as to defeat these hidden quantities that disassemble the nature of those that stand for the concerted effort to make this planet a more acceptable place for all that inhabit it. 
Only throughout the power of language and its art will this become a possibility as we move forward into an uncertainyet determinate futureutilizing the power of free will to outline an outcome that will allow us to survive and enlighten our sense of being with the knowledge necessary to perpetuate a positive outcome for the human race." />
