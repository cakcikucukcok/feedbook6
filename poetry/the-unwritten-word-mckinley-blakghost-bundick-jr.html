  <title>The Unwritten Word - McKinley “Blakghost” Bundick Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A book of religious inspired poetry, The Unwritten Word touches on overcoming adversity through poetry. I remember hearing a bunch of my friends saying they were spiritual, just not religious. I examined their claims and their outlook on spirituality and religion and that is where I got the title, The Unwritten Word. I believe the word is in us and it is up to us to continue to write the truths on how God has affected our lives. These poems are merely Psalms in my book of life. Something I decided to write to release the pain of life and help those who may be going through similar situations. The Unwritten Word is a collection of poems for people who were, like me, too timid to look to the heavens to find their strength. Inspired by events of my life and my many questions about my religion and the people in it, I wrote these poems to help those who may have been confused like I once was. These poems are not just poems but stories in rhyme form. My late father was the inspiration for me to write this book of poetry. I hope everyone enjoys it, just as much as he did." />
