  <title>Fruitful Prayers - Dr. Moses Anyanwu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book Fruitful Prayers is a prayer manual written to guide us as we pray to avoid vain repetitions and wrong warfare prayers whereby most people pray for the death of the devil and enemies. We need to pray in wisdom, forgiving those that have offended us and not pray for their deaths because the bible says we should pray for our enemies and those who use us, should also forgive those who offended us as God forgives us our sins.
God sent His Son to die for our sins and all He wants to do is see that we are saved and that we do not perish. Fruitful Prayers will give you guidelines on how to pray in humility, with a good heart, with faith and an expectant and compassionate heart etc and God will answer you.
Revd. Dr. Moses Anyanwu is a man called by God who has been used by God around the world, in conferences, Seminars, Revivals, church planting programs, television and radio ministry, School of Ministries etc 
As an Apostle of faith who believes in hearing and speaking what God says to him anywhere at any time he is sensitive to what the Holy Spirit has to say to the people of God. This book contains some of those words God spoke to him while he was in the mission field ministering to people worldwide.
In his 23 years of full time ministry preaching around the globe the word of faith from his mouth inspired by the Holy Spirit has blessed millions of people though his televangelism program Hour of Grace and many have testimonies of healing, deliverance and signs and wonders
