  <title>Quest for Peace - Amrik Binapal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The fast pace of the technological development during the past about two decades, particularly in television and information technology, has put up such an enormous and sudden pressure on the human mind that the man of today has difficulty bearing it. &lt;i&gt;Quest for Peace&lt;/i&gt; examines the gap between the reality and the illusions of life that is widening every day. Mans desire for material things has increased to the extent that we are not able to make the right choices and maintain the correct balance in our lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science has delivered many wonderful things to us, but we have lost the peace and calm of a less harried life. We are just running without knowing what exactly we needand what we dont need. The moral values that might help to balance the situation seem to have taken a back seat to the fast pace of todays world. In his poetry collection, &lt;i&gt;Quest for Peace&lt;/i&gt;, author Amrik Binapal chronicles his innermost thoughts based upon his life experiences with the hope that it might ease the pressure of everyday life for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;Work Hard and Stay Humble&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Only after experiencing&lt;br&gt;
Pain and hardship,&lt;br&gt;
Do we realize,&lt;br&gt;
Peace and its true essence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Only after surviving&lt;br&gt;
Destruction and death,&lt;br&gt;
Do we understand and appreciate,&lt;br&gt;
The real value of life &lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
