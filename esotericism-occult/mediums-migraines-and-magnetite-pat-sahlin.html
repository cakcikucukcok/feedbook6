  <title>Mediums, Migraines, and Magnetite - Pat Sahlin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Is it possible for a medium to use automatic writing to have an instant messenger chat with your long lost great-aunt Mary?  That s ridiculous. . . . .  isnt it?  Or is it?  It seems that a lot of people are doing exactly that.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Can some people predict an earthquake within a few days, because their ears ring and they have a headache?  Documentation is showing that, yes, apparently they can and do.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Its completely impossible to travel back in time via remote viewing to see places and events from centuries ago. . . . isnt it?  Perhaps.  And then again, perhaps not.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	Can a medium create a sculpture portrait of a completely unknown spirit entity with no reference material at all, and nothing but a psychic vision of a ghost?
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
	At first glance, these things may seem outlandish, something from science fiction.  Are they?   Are they really supernatural, or could it be something more simple? Could it be connected to something science is just beginning to explore; a tiny crystal called magnetite in the human body.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;In many ways, this book is as unique and extraordinary as the life and mind of its author.  You are about to embark on a precious journey of personal exploration and awakening.  If you are looking for adventure and enlightenment, I welcome you to Pats quest for answers. &lt;/i&gt;
