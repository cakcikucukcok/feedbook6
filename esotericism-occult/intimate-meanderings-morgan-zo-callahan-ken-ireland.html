  <title>Intimate Meanderings - Morgan Zo-Callahan, Ken Ireland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What appeals to me intellectually and emotionally about your book is that reading these pieces together creates a very new context to hold the experience of life. Spirituality, what you call meditation, is the glue that holds all the parts together. I feel that all your contributors are committed to integrate the fragments of what knowledge and methods we have acquired  with real life experience.&lt;br&gt; 
John Lounibos, PhD&lt;p&gt; 
Intimate Meanderings  is an inspiring array of insight and bears witness to human life and our innate movement towards wholeness.&lt;br&gt; 
Roshi Wendy Egyoku Nakao, Abbot ZCLA, Buddha Essence Temple&lt;p&gt; 
This book is an amazing potpourri of wisdom. Intimate Meanderings should be required reading in every Jesuit tent.&lt;br&gt; 
Dan Berrigan, S.J.&lt;p&gt; 
Most memoirs are I-full. Morgan gives us a lot of We-full.&lt;br&gt; 
Robert Blair Kaiser&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;i&gt;Intimate Meanderings&lt;/i&gt; shares the wisdom, inner-thoughts, and vast experiences of over twenty-five contributors who offer their inspiring reflections on meditation, religion, community involvement, hospice, and death, ultimately piquing spiritual and literary curiosity for those contemplating their own pilgrimage through life.&lt;p&gt; 
A glance at the list of contributors, their articles, conversations, and poems illustrates their breadth and depth as well as diversity; personal historiesboth positive and negativethat need to be told and not forgotten; spiritual journeys that still have a powerful impact; and poetry that captures emotional and motivational moments. Zo-Callahan and friends honestly communicate their deepest desires and yearnings as they explore the inner and inter-relational processes of obtaining serenity and joy." />
