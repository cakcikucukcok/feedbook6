  <title>Indigo Scout - Arnette Lamoreaux</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The emphasis has been on who or what is Indigo rather than on why Indigo. Per Abraham, Indigo refers to the vibration of and around a soul. The human body, which encompasses the Indigo Soul, in essence, radiates energy at a higher level than that of their counterparts. Many writings have described the characteristics (or behaviors) of Indigo and suggest ideas of how we can support them in school and at home. All valid! Most Indigo have difficulty conforming to society standards, when it was the non-Indigo population who made the rules in the first place. In the mind of the Indigo, the rules, technically, do not apply to them. Indigo think, Why bother with the restrictions or expectations attempted to be placed on me when the end result is not my normal but yours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will not find many materialistic, over-achieving, and corporate climbing Indigo in our midst. The Indigo is not motivated by the same wants and desires. God sent them to Earth for a reason. Allow them to step into purpose and bring balance to where we all live. Help make way for the Indigo Soul.&lt;/p&gt;" />
