  <title>Just When I Thought My Life Was over “But God!” - Cassie Louis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Hi, my name is Cassie Louis, and the purpose of me writing my book is, I was diagnosed with the HIV virus five years ago. I must say, God has put on my heart, and he has also changed my heart so that I can help, change, and heal souls that are struggling with this same illness. Now I personally want to also help, change, and heal souls that are struggling with this illness. I know without a fact and without a doubt that many souls are suffering with the struggles of this illness.
I know because I have come in contact with many, and they all state the same struggles as I have once had in my past. To your thought, my book is all about freeing the souls that is currently struggling and suffering today with the HIV virus and AIDS. And also I want to save the world with my healing and with my blessings. My book is stating to the victims that they can live again simply because they have stopped due to the fact of the stereotyping and the opinions of others in this world. My book will talk to their souls and their hearts. My book will put smiles on their faces. They will never frown again when relating to this illness, which is the HIV virus and AIDS. When theyve read my book, they will laugh instead of always cry. When the victims read my book, they will then know and feel the security of God. They will say I am just fine only and just because God is in control and because he is going to allow me to live. As they read, the victims will recover from their pain and they will gain back the lives that they had lost.
They will see the sunshine from the sun, and they will see the light from life again. But this time, it will be a different light. It will be the light of grace coming to rescue, save, and welcome them back into the life that they never thought they had, which is the spiritual life. The life where your experience pure happiness, joy, blessings, happy and cherished moments, peace, and much more. So when my book is and has changed and saved lives, then I will say to myself and to God that I have made a difference to the world. My heart will be contented, and also it will be at peace, knowing that I have indeed changed, saved and also healed the world.
The Xlibris Publishing Company is my reason and also my synopsis of what my book is all about. And I want to thank you from my heart and my life for helping me accomplish this mission. Because overall, its about others and saving souls." />
