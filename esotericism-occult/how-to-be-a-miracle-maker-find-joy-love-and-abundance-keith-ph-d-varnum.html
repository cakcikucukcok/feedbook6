  <title>How to Be a Miracle Maker: Find Joy, Love and Abundance - Keith Ph.D Varnum</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This ground-breaking book reveals the extraordinary creative powers within you that can heal your body, expand your love, and attract phenomenal abundance into every area of your life. Talented storyteller Keith Varnum shares a practical manual that shows you how to be an everyday Miracle Maker! Fresh and captivating, chock-full of riveting escapades, this inspirational book chronicles how the author develops his inner guidance to lead him to unexpected power and wisdom. And you discover how you can do the same to conquer your greatest fears, soar above the ordinary, and reach all your heart&amp;#39;s desires. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book&amp;#39;s 48 true personal stories illustrate how miracles flow when you listen to your inner counsel. At 19 after Varnum cured himself of blindness, this extraordinary visionary began teaching others how to heal themselves and fulfill their deepest passions. Drawing from his broad exploration as a healer, acupuncturist, urban shaman, filmmaker, personal coach, vision quest guide, corporate VP, and international seminar leader, Varnum describes in down-to-earth terms how following intuition can uncover hidden secrets of previously unimaginable human ability. The author demonstrates the real-life use of the seemingly implausible potentials of quantum physics&amp;mdash;such possibilities as alternate realities, time travel, near-death experience, out-of-body journeys and levitation. These mind-boggling true stories will expand the way you think about yourself and your ability to transform your world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Neale Donald Walsch, author of the best-selling &amp;quot;Conversations with God,&amp;quot; calls this book &amp;quot;so captivating that it can shift any reader beyond time and space.&amp;quot; Relish the stories that convey the lessons that can be learned from nature&amp;mdash;plants, animals, rocks, water&amp;mdash;and from nonphysical beings. Get the thrill of peeking into other dimensions! And the author&amp;#39;s lively sense of humor renders the tales even more enjoyable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;How to Be a Miracle Maker&amp;quot; is for anybody who wants more love, yearns for a fulfilling job, or seeks a purpose beyond the mundane. It can unlock a reservoir of motivation to uncap a free flow of miracles into your life. If you want a greater awareness of your unlimited potential, if you want to wake up to the extraordinary truth of who you are, if you want to read entrancing, entertaining real-life stories&amp;mdash;then this book is just what your heart ordered." />
