  <title>Parables from the Tree of Life - Pat S. Hilger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Parables from the Tree of Life depicts to us how nature often shows us the way.  The story (somewhat  autobiographical) follows a little girl growing up to become a young woman, learning spiritual lessons from reflections of the trees and with direction of her spiritual guide within.  The book constitutes a narrative between the girl and the tree of life as she encounters the many trials and tribulations and occasionally triumphs in life, growing up in a large family in a culturally diverse setting.
The &#39;tree of life&#39; is the English name for arborvitae.  The trees cover the Door County Wisconsin shoreline for many miles.  They are not indigenous to North America, but were brought to us by sailors who made tea from their leaves to prevent scurvy.  Thus they were truly named &#39;tree of life&#39;.  The story starts with the young girl growing up in central Illinois with frequent visits to North eastern Wisconsin.
With a unique photograph of the adaptation of trees with each chapter coupled with the wisdom of the spirit, this book presents an inspirational and encouraging portrayal of contending with the many vicissitudes of life.  The book is especially directed to those who live with depression and other forms of chronic pain, bravely keeping a smile on their faces and battling on with honest questioning and attempted integrity in life&#39;s situations.
These stories show the girl encountering a number of religions and peoples, all the while striving to find a true course.  Scars, and breaks and various anomalies of tree growth are viewed through the eyes of the spirit as positive and educational, though rarely easily acquired.
This little book can help people on their life journey just as this little girl found her way from a young child into womanhood," />
