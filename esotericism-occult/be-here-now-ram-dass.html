  <title>Be Here Now - Ram Dass</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;Now, though I am a beginner on the path, I have returned to the West for a time to work out karma or unfulfilled commitment. Part of this commitment is to share what I have learned with those of you who are on a similar journey. One can share a message through telling &#39;our-story&#39; as I have just done, or through the teaching methods of yoga, or singing, or making love. Each of us finds his unique vehicle for sharing with others his bit of wisdom. For me, this story is but a vehicle for sharing with you the true message. . . the living faith in what is possible.&quot;&amp;#8212;from &lt;em&gt; Be Here Now&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1970, Ram Dass&#39; &lt;em&gt;Be Here Now &lt;/em&gt; became the counter-culture bible for thousands of young people seeking enlightenment in the midst of the darkness of Vietnam. It was a pioneering bridge, written in colloquial language, from the psychedelic 60s to eastern spirituality, and over the years has sold and continues to sell more than two million copies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now in an e-book edition, Ram Dass&#39; message is brought to life for a new generation of seekers. This will be a beautiful digital edition of this classic and enlightening book.&lt;/p&gt;" />
