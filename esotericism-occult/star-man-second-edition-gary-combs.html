  <title>Star Man    Second Edition - Gary Combs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Are you ready to Man Up? According to national statistics, over fifty percent of you working men are unhappy in your jobs. In Star Man, author Gary Combs asks: Is it your work that really bothers you? Or, could you be wrestling with a mixed sense of purpose or conflicting priorities that keep boiling inside? If you are among the men who tend to barricade themselves in their man-caves, turning inward and seeking their own solutions, then what is really holding you back?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Star Man tackles these questions head-on from a uniquely male perspective. Tracing five major areas of a mans daily life  love relationships, family focus, work life, community involvement, and health issues - Combs develops a balanced approach to ensuring that all five areas are given their rightful place. In each aspect, he moves you quickly to a self-assessment of your everyday questions:&lt;/P&gt;
1.	My days are so full of busyness Who has time to think anymore?&lt;/br&gt;
2.	I keep saying, Someday Ill _____. Will that day ever come?&lt;/br&gt;
3.	How can I make sure it does?&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Filling each area of daily concern with personal anecdotes and humorous man-talk, often poking fun at the way men speak (and the way women hear), Star Man concludes with the thought provoking point that every man is looking for some greater meaning. With conviction, Combs suggests that God is acting at the center of all that a man does, whether or not he realizes it. Star man concludes with the encouraging reminder and personal witness that every man is sustained by Gods strength and His grace. It is in recognizing His divine influence and following His will that you find the answers you seek.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Star Man&lt;/i&gt; can help any manespecially those in their thirties, forties, and fiftiestake the steps necessary to regain balance. Don&#39;t hesitatelet Gary&#39;s messages help you forge your path to a more balanced life today!
