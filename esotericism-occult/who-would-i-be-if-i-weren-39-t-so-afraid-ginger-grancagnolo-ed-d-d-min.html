      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Having found the answer to the question posed by her book, &lt;em&gt;Who Would I Be If I Weren&#39;t So Afraid?,&lt;/em&gt; Ginger Grancagnolo, Ed D, teaches us how to do the same thing ourselves. The author describes seemingly endless years that she has spent struggling with paralyzing fear to help others comfort our own insecurities and anxieties. Through comprehensive analyses of the different kinds of relationships in which we engage and of the various models through which we define ourselves, she emphasizes that even the most fearful among us can escape from the psychological obstacles that prevent us from leading healthy lives. The simple exercises that she provides enable us to regain our self-worth and to discover the tools we need in facing intimidating environments. Who Would I Be If I Weren&#39;t So Afraid? is beneficial to anyone who knows what it is like to be a victim of fear.&lt;/p&gt;" />
