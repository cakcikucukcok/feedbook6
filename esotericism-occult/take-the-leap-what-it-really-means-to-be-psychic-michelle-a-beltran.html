  <title>Take the Leap: What It Really Means to Be Psychic - Michelle A. Beltran</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An introductory guidebook for aspiring psychics  Beltran gives plenty of empowering advice, in the style of a self-help guide, on the benefits of tapping ones full potential through the power of intuition  
 Kirkus Reviews &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michelles book should be a must-read for all students beginning the spiritual path. 
 Dr. Angela Thompson Smith, Ph.D. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Her grounded, systematic approach teaches us how to consciously develop, train and master our individual psychic mind. Consequently Take The Leap serves as both a training course in personal exploration and an insightful map for understanding the world of psychics and mediums. Highly recommended for people who get readings or those who want to give them! 
 Bob Olson, author of Answers about the Afterlife: A Private Investigators 15-Year Research Unlocks the Mysteries of Life after Death &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible for anyone to make the conscious decision to develop, rekindle, or magnify the powers of their intuitive voicetheir psychic mind. This book is written to discuss what it means to be psychic. The path to the supernatural world of the psychic begins by expanding and fine-tuning intuition, then paying close attention to both the seen and unseen world that surrounds us. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our minds are not simply an appendage of our bodies like arms or legs. The mind is a powerful tool from which we can access universal truths and expand our understanding of our inner selves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself moved by a strong suspicion that there is more to life than what can be seen or easily explained, then this book is for you. If you find yourself with an overwhelming desire to explore what lies outside the realm of physical science or earthly understanding, this book will inform you. If you want to know what abilities function outside the domain of natural laws, this book will enlighten you. &lt;/p&gt;" />
