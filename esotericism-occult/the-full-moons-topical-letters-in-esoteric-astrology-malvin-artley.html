  <title>The Full Moons: Topical Letters In Esoteric Astrology - Malvin Artley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Full Moons is an exploration of the Sun the Moon, the Truth and their interrelation, and it is the culmination of over ten years of letters the author has written on esoteric astrology. A compendium of topics in esoteric astrology, it explores the emerging universal spirituality, gradually unfolding through the current decades as seen from the perspective of topical world events, even though the principles investigated therein are timeless. The twelve astrological signs each give a unique insight into various aspects of spirituality, and each one has its own story to tell on the great evolutionary path of the soul. Because the soul is so dear to us, even though the subject matter of the book is esoteric in its presentation, there is something in its pages for everyone, whether or not you have an astrological background. Ultimately, this book can be used as reference material for the times of the full moon each month and for specified times in between. The book is extensively indexed for ease of reference and it contains abundant reference material in the appendices, along with a glossary of esoteric terminology." />
