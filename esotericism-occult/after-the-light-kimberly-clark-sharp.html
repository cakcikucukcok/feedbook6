  <title>After the Light - Kimberly Clark Sharp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Death is nothing to fear-and life without fear can be lived to the fullest.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
This is Kimberly Clark Sharp&#39;s message from her extraordinary experience during the time after her heart suddenly stopped beating and she lay on the sidewalk, not breathing, and without a pulse. Swept into a peaceful loving place of brilliant golden light and warm comfort, she saw, for the first time, the meaning of life-and death.&lt;/P&gt;
Thereafter, Kimberly, with hamster Toto at her side, left Kansas for Seattle-known as &quot;the Emerald City&quot;-to fulfill a destiny devoted to the service of others as foreseen at the end of her near-death experience. Guided by a new sensitivity to the presence of angels, demons and other invisibilities, Kimberly attained a Masters degree in Social Work at the University of Washington and began a career in medical social work that put her in direct contact with dying people-and people who almost died and came back.&lt;/P&gt;
It is the inspirational stories of these near-death experiences, as well as Kimberly&#39;s own life challenges in love, family life and the diagnosis of breast cancer, that form the core of this surprisingly funny page-turner of a book." />
