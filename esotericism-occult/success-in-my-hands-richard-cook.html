  <title>Success in My Hands - Richard Cook</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Success in my hands&lt;/i&gt; was written as part of my fundraising journey to raise vital funds for Help For Heroes. 
It is my way of saying thank you to the Armed Forces for the opportunities and adventures that came from being connected with them. My father is ex-army (Royal Engineers) with postings to Malta, Germany (Berlin and Willich), the island of St Helena (South Atlantic Ocean), and Cyprus when I was a child. For twenty-five to thirty years, I had anxiety, depression and panic attacks related to how I viewed my arms. In 2006, I went to Harley Street, London, for help with changing my thinking patterns to live a more peaceful and happier life. Now with a sense of peace and freedom from my past, I am fundraising for Help for Heroes. 
25% from the sale price of each book (Success In my Hands) sold will be contributed to Help for Heroes Trading Limited, (Registered Company No. 6363256) which Gift Aids all its taxable profits to Help for Heroes (Registered Charity Number 1120920)." />
