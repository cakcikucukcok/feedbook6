  <title>Marriage, It’S Not Physical …It’S … S P I R I T Ua L!!! ...(Holy) - Evangelist Alicia F. Rooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I was inspired to write the book titled: Marriage, Its Not PhysicalIts Spiritual (Holy) about 12 years ago. After experiencing two unsuccessful marriages, and still having the desire to marry again one day when the Lord allow me to connect with the right person, for real this time then I will be relieved. I pray that this time I will take my own advice, do my homework, and realize that it is not a physical thing, it is Spiritual! I am no marriage counselor, and definitely do not claim to have all of the answers however, experience isI would say a great teacher. You see, some people, they never learn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I pray that this time I could reminisce on what I have gone through realizing that it was not just for me, but on purpose and for others. You see when God has a plan and has a willing vessel that will answer the call then He will allow His will/work to be done through whomever is willing. The key word is willing because a lot of people are not willing. Instead of complaining, I have learned to say, ok, Lord, what lesson do You want me to learn from this? Who would you like me to minister to through my experience of going about marriage that You have designed the wrong way? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As others read this book, I know that it would be a life-changing awakening. I believe that hearts/marriages/relationships would be mended, and healed. I know that this is not just another book to pick up and read at your own leisure, but if I must say so myself, it is a book that once you pick it up, you will not want to put it down until it has ministered to you completely!&lt;/p&gt;" />
