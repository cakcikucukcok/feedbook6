  <title>Love Outside The Box - Thomas Deane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Join author and relationships expert Deane Thomas as he encourages readers to begin their journey toward satisfying and permanent love of self -- so essential for day-to-day living and happiness..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll learn how self-love is every person&amp;rsquo;s right, and how we are born with it. Find out why it is that, for most of us, self-love seems to get lost along the way as we focus more on others&amp;rsquo; needs at the expense of our own.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Love is an essence that lives within each of us -- very pure and very real,&amp;rdquo; the author says. Learn how to find your own &amp;ldquo;Twin Soul,&amp;rdquo; and begin experiencing that deep-down feeling of completion that only comes when a relationship is truly grounded in love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book offers solid advice and concrete commentary on how your feelings of self-love might have become buried over time and what to do to reclaim it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember. Love begins and ends with each of us. It is an amazing energy that should be shared without condition or expectation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Learn to look in a mirror and love what you see each day. Love Outside the Box will help you do that.&lt;/p&gt;" />
