  <title>Awakening the Divine Within - Anne Armstrong, Jim Armstrong</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Decades ago, Jim and Anne Armstrong were Iiving an ordinary American life. Not particularly interested in spiritual matters, Jim and Annes focus was on their careers and making ends meet. But when Anne began suffering from crippling headaches not cured by traditional medicine, she and her husband turned to hypnosis and made a discovery that would change their lives forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hypnosis sessions began to reveal that Annes headaches were caused by spiritual forces straining to express themselves through her, Anne began a journey during which she and Jim eventually learned to accept, work with and come to terms with these forces, a realization that led them to teach workshops around the world helping others understand and develop their own psychic and spiritual abilities. In their comprehensive guide to Kundalini practices, Anne and Jim worked to demystify the psychic/intuitive realm as they shared Annes profound personal experiences and explored in depth the spiritual/intuitive process, meditation, transpersonal counseling, and the Kundalini method.&lt;/p&gt;" />
