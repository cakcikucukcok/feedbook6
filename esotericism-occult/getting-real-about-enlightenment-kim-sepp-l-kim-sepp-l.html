  <title>Getting Real About Enlightenment - Kim Seppälä, Kim Seppälä</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book lifts the veils of mystery around embodied spirituality and sovereignty. What happens to our minds, hearts and bodies when we allow the alchemical process of self-realization? How does it affect our lives and relationships, and how can we navigate through the dark night of the Soul into the dawn of enlightenment? These are some of the themes covered in this book. Whilst each path is unique and personal, there are certain tools that can be supportive on this bizarre adventure. In addition to such tools of clarity and inspiration, the book includes in-depth interviews with eight modern masters, awakened humans who are walking their paths of self-realization whilst living very human, 21st century lives. Above all, the purpose of this book is to support the reader in connecting with and embodying their inner voice of wisdom and mastery.&lt;/p&gt;" />
