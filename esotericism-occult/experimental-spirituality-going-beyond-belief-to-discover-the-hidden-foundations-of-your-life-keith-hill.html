  <title>Experimental Spirituality: Going Beyond Belief to Discover the Hidden Foundations of Your Life - Keith Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We live in an era when traditional religious approaches to spirituality are increasingly losing relevance. Equally, the sciences, which have very successfully helped us understand physical reality, are not equipped to fathom the subtleties of deep inner experience. Each approach offers useful insights, but neither is sufficient. We urgently need new forms of spirituality appropriate to life in the twenty-first century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimental Spirituality&lt;/em&gt; is the first in a series of five channelled books that offer an approach to spirituality designed for today&amp;rsquo;s seekers. Grounding spirituality in personal experience, the series proposes that each human being is not merely a combination of body and spirit, but a complex identity incorporating five layers. The implications are explored in detail throughout the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Experimental Spirituality&lt;/em&gt; introduces a rational, empirical approach to spiritual development. It suggests practical ways seekers may gain new insights into their life situation and deep identity. Topics include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Where your life is headed is the result of an experiment you set in motion&amp;bull;&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Why maturing spiritually involves a journey from belief to understanding&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;How testing assumptions leads to new inner knowledge&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;What you think God is cannot be the same as what God actually is&lt;/li&gt; 	&lt;li&gt;Who you are involves a complex interplay of multiple layers of reality&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;" />
