  <title>The Illuminas - Cheryl Banfield</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Mother Marys mission is to help us evolve more quickly as spiritual beings in this physical experience. The information in The Illuminas: The Light Centers of the Light Body was given by her as a tool to expand and evolve our spiritual light. 
After the Earths vibrational shift at the end of 2012, we are now able to hold a higher vibration, allowing our spiritual selves here in this earth to experience more. We have begun developing light centers, called illuminas, which go beyond the chakras. Working with the illuminas through meditation, intention, and energy work can allow us to live more as our spirit than ever before. 
The Illuminas: The Light Centers of the Light Body gives a beginning look into the structure and meaning of the illuminas, how they can be used for spiritual evolvement, and their importance in our lives as well as to the earth as a whole. 
The illuminas allow us to raise our vibration and blend spiritual experiences into the physical. Living from our spiritual perspective can help shift others and, in turn, shift the vibration of the earth. 
It is time for us to move beyond our mindfulness of our awakened state and step into living through our spirit in each moment in peace, in love, and in joy." />
