  <title>Tomorrow - Andrew J. Rickert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow: A Memoir of Love, Family, and Dealing with Dementia presents, as an open book, the recollections and insights of Andrew J. Rickert, whose sister, Edna, faced the affliction of dementia. Authorized by her power of attorney to serve as her agent, he searched for and found ways to balance his financial, legal, and administrative duties with his lifelong ties that bound the two together as sister and brother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After providing a sketch of his familys background and history, the author recounts a series of observations about events and encounters with Edna. The clear vision that comes only in hindsight enables him to point out the warning signs he missed in the moment. In the next group of chapters, he recounts the events that transpired in a series of five visits. Finally, an epilogue provides a summary and a sense of closure to the account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the pages of Tomorrow: A Memoir of Love, Family, and Dealing with Dementia, the author blends together his own perceptions of his family history with the account of his work as his sisters agent. This mix enables the reader to approach the book both as one mans memoir and as a narrative that provides guidance to anyone who may face the duties of serving as a loved ones agent.&lt;/p&gt;" />
