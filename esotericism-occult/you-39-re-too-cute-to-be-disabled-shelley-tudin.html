  <title>You&#39;re Too Cute to Be Disabled - Shelley Tudin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When you feel like giving up, remember why you held on for so long in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At just eleven years old, author Shelley Tudin was diagnosed with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, a debilitating disease for which there is no cure. As the disease progressed, Shelley struggled and found some things out of her reachsuch as her love of figure skating and her desire to become a nurse. Even so, she never let the disease prevent her from living life to the fullest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this memoir, she narrates an inspirational story of how she battled the disease and its weakening symptoms to achieve her dreams. &lt;i&gt;Youre Too Cute to Be Disabled &lt;/i&gt;recalls her journeygrowing up in Brantford, Ontario, Canada; graduating from high school in 1983; attending college at the University of Guelph; dealing with romantic relationships; coping with the loss of loved ones; and managing an illness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Youre Too Cute to Be Disabled &lt;/i&gt;shows that through Shelleys varied experiences, she gained the confidence, the wisdom, and the power of positive thinking to turn dreams into realities. It shares her transition from a young, frightened girl to a self-confident, happy, independent, and incredibly tenacious woman through a lot of love, laughter, and tears.&lt;/p&gt;" />
