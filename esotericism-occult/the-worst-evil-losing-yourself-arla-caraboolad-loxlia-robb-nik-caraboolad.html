  <title>The Worst Evil—Losing Yourself - Arla Caraboolad, Loxlia Robb, Nik Caraboolad</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt; Arlas journey left her sure she had a self, but uncertain where to look for validation of it. Fortunately, her self lead her to question God. She began to discover that God &lt;i&gt;really does LOVE people&lt;/i&gt;, in fact He likes them, and anything that disconnects us from Him, or causes us to deny our potential, was not from God, but was a result, directly or indirectly, of evil. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Drawing from her experience as a therapist, Arla shares how evil works through authority figures to make children (and adults) doubt their value and worth. She provides very detailed and practical advice about the struggle between good and evil that pervades our world; and how this battle manifests itself in our lives. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; She shows how false beliefs, even if youre unconscious of them, distort self-worth and lead us to make dangerous and discouraging choices; and how a correct understanding of God can heal you and lead to discovering your true self. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Why do we make the choices we do? What is it that compels us to drift in certain directions? Are there forces working behind the scenes to affect our daily life? Are there tools we can employ in our lives that will make a difference? Do we have a choice? Must we accept the lies placed on us? Is there research that supports the affect of our choices?  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; If you have wondered why you make choices you wish you didnt make, and how to start making choices that fulfill you and bring you to experience real joy, this is the book for you. Do you feel empty, like you have no choice? Can life change? Is there hope? Are you stuck? Here is understanding. Read and find strength and hope. Awaken to the fact that you are desired &lt;i&gt;as you are&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;" />
