  <title>The Power and Light That Is You - Linda Lee</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if you had the Secret to creating all you desire?
We are in such a dynamic time in history!  So many of us have tried different techniques to create abundance, prosperity, happiness, fulfilling relationships and perfect health only to fall short, asking our self why?  They make it sound so easy yet there is something missing.  Until you discover your connection to the Divine, the Universe without and the Universe within, and how this energy is so easily tapped into and your connection to it, it will elude you.  The biggest challenge that I have come across with clients and people in general is that they do not trust their self, their deep inner guidance of that still small voice let alone listen to it and follow it.  Unless you learn to trust your inner guidance there is no way you can ultimately have a sincere open relationship with your Higher Source whether you call it Divine Energy, Spirit, Love or God; which is where your love and wisdom connect.  Learning to connect to the Infinite and the limitless possibilities of what that means allows you to shine your light brighter and brighter.  Life is truly a gift to experience all there is and to live it as the adventure it is.  If you are not growing and opening to new possibility then you are dying, there is nothing in between.  We do not have time any longer to remain a victim becoming empowered in the process, it is now time to stand fully in your light and shine bright!  
	Discover your connection to the universe and how to create all you desire
	Become the gatekeeper of your mind
	Simply learn how to connect with the universal law of attraction
	Express a higher vibration and higher levels of knowing to live your life purpose
	Remember who you are and the unique qualities you are here to express" />
