  <title>Above the Fray - Owen Thomas Ashton, Md</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Life is an ever changing and often unpredictable sequence of events that rarely fulfills our expectations or desires. And yet in the long run, if we can be objective in our assessment, we find that unpredictable and challenging events invariably contribute to our growth and maturity. Could it be that adversity is a message and a gift from Infinite Wisdom? Is it possible to perceive perfection in all things simply by changing our point of view? Is there some body of secret knowledge that when applied can allow us to find meaning and clarity in all events? 
Yes, yes, and triple yes. By increasing our level of awareness, we can render all concerns, obstacles, misfortunes, and mistakes as utterly irrelevant. This is a powerful statement that may take some radical examination of our present approach to life on planet earth, but perhaps up until the present moment, we have missed something that in retrospect would seem very obvious. 
It would be very beneficial if we could accept as perfect even the harshest of lifes difficulties. Oh, looking back over the past ten years of ones life experience, one might finally admit that the lesson learned was necessary and even desired; however it required too many years of suffering to finally reach such a conclusion. Increasing ones level of awareness, and applying concepts that have been taught throughout the ages, coupled with a sprinkling of new scientific breakthroughs, potentially could lessen or even eliminate this suffering. The illusions of insanity that seemingly permeate our lives will become important tools in the ascent of our journey into Awareness." />
