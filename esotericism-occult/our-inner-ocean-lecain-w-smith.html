  <title>Our Inner Ocean - LeCain W. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Good health is something we all aspire to, but its so much more than just being free of disease. A perfectly functioning body, tranquil mind, and vibrant spirit working together harmoniously create the joy and happiness that put the good in good health and the worth into a life worth living.&lt;br /&gt;
Our Inner Ocean describes ancient and new holistic modalities of practitioner-applied bodywork and revitalizing self-care practices. These illuminate our human potential and awaken our ability to attain and maintain perfect health and well-being. These modalities act as a springboard from which to dive into our inner oceanthe realm of wisdom within that is entered by making the body, breath, and energy our allies. This mystical space of awareness, intuition, peace, and love can become the resting place of the spirit, subtly working its magic on ourselves and others.&lt;br /&gt;
Bodywork has long been recognized as a way to help people feel better physically, but the magic of touch can also help us tap in to the wisdom of the body, discover the power of the energy that permeates it, and evoke its innate healing ability. Self-care practices such as yoga, qi gong, breathwork, and meditation help us become our own healers. When we pass through these portals into the inner ocean, we can reduce stress and pain, release blockages, prevent and resolve dysfunctions, and ignite our spiritual nature. And in doing so, we make the world a better place." />
