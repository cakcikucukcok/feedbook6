  <title>Taking up the Chase - William A. Hillman Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Maria Marhills home life is already difficult. Along with typical teenage stressesschool, friends, and boysher father had been in a terrible accident that left him comatose. Years have passed since that terrible day, but Maria and her mother still live on and struggle to move forward. And Maria &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; moving forwarduntil the morning she has her first vision.
In the vision, she sees a bank heist. She knows this isnt just a dream; after all, dreams dont usually happen when youre awake. Maria does what she had to do: she makes an anonymous phone call to Detective Lenny Hipar. Fortunately, he listens, and the crooks dont succeed. Soon, Maria seeks out Detective Hipar for support as her visions continue; she fears losing her mind.
Maria keeps it all a secret; she doesnt know if her mom can handle it, after her fathers accident. But Marias newfound talent has made her a target. With the help of Hipar, she must stand up to crime bosses, drug dealers, and bank robbers, all in the name of justice. Marias psychic gift has the potential to ruin her life and her relationship with her mombut it could also bring her family back together." />
