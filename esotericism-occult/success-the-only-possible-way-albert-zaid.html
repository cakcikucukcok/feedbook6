  <title>Success: The Only Possible Way. - Albert Zaid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We have always been formed in the mistaken belief that success is reserved for only a few people, and that the rest of us have to be content with waiting for luck to come to us to achieve what we yearn for.
This book explains and develops the thesis that all human beings are genetically configured to seek and achieve success, that we do it naturally, spontaneously, without realizing it, and that no one can escape it because it is impossible to overcome the logical laws that govern our thoughts.
It shows how erroneous conceptions of the world around us directly affect the conditioning of our thoughts, diverting us from the pursuit of the goals we have set for ourselves.
It contains a detailed exposition about intolerance to frustration, its fundamental causes, its harmful effects, and how to correct it.
A text that will help you discover yourself, get rid of the obstacles that prevent you from moving forward, and set realistic goals that you will ALWAYS be able to achieve.
In short, a book that will serve as a guide and orientation for the paths to SUCCESS.&lt;br/&gt;" />
