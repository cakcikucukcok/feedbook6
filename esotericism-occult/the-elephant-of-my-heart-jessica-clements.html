  <title>The Elephant of My Heart - Jessica Clements</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Elephant of My Heart&lt;/i&gt; is the story that emerged as Jessica Clements took her first inner journey on the Personal Totem Pole Process originated by Stephen Gallegos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessicas life had not been easy, for at nine years old, she had suffered a brain haemorrhage. Yet this was just where her new guide, her elephant, took her to, though in the gentlest and softest of ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was here that her elephant, and numerous other animals, taught her that the scars that criss-cross her head can be seen in a different way, for now they are stitched with a black panthers whisker and held by a dragonfly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read this book in an evening and couldnt put it down as I was taken on a magical journey by the Elephant at Jessicas Heart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen Wish, &lt;i&gt;Polar Bear Community&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like animals and meditate then I highly recommend this book!&lt;/p&gt;
