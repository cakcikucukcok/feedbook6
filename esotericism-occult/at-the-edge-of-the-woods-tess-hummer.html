  <title>At the Edge of the Woods - Tess Hummer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tess Hummers memoir, ................. vibrates with life. The anguish of her childhood is relayed with such unsentimental clarity that we cant help but love her and cheer her toward transformation. The road is hard and she doesnt spare anyone, least of all herself. Her journey from homelessness to home is something that will crack open the hardest of hearts. This is Angelas Ashes for the new millennium.
	Alan Watt - (bestselling author of The 90-Day Novel, and founder of L.A. Writers Lab)
Tess and I were in the LA Writers workshop in 2010. She was writing a memoir about her life, much of it dealt with her experiences as a homeless woman in the LA area. I swear to god, I never cried in that workshop until Tess presented her work. Its a sleeper--take my word for it.
	Frank Wilderson III - Author, Incognegro, A Memoir of Exile and Apartheid, Red, White and Black: Cinema and the Structure of U.S. Antagonists
In, At Edge of the Woods, baby boomer, Tess Hummer, transports us to a nostalgic America with crisp imagery that paints a story more like a forbodding Hopper than a Rockwell, as she reflects on choices, responsibility, and the sobriety of conscience on the journey to make sense of her life , which spans seven decades, from her crowded family home in Connecticut to a Starbucks in Malibu, in her relatable and engaging memoir.

This book will prevent you from doing your chores. From the first sentence youll be hooked. Get ready with a comfortable reading chair for the duration. I suggest that At the Edge of the Woods, by Tess Hummer is a consummate personal and spiritual memoir that illustrates what can be chosen, created and experienced within a human life. The fact that Hummers book is a fabulously successful read is a testament to her life and insights.
