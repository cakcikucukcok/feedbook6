  <title>Secrets, Lies, &amp; Revealing Truths - Elaine P. Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Note from the Author 
Hello, I am Elaine P. Davis and I live in metro Atlanta with my husband, Arthur. I believe that one of my spiritual gifts is creative writing. Hopefully, the stories that I write are spiritually inspiring. I strongly believe that words are powerful, so we must be mindful of the words we speak, as well as what we read. Words permeate the mind, which impacts our spirit. As Christians, we must be careful what we feed our spirit. My wish is that these stories may help someone reflect on their thoughts and actions.
Secrets, Lies, and Revealing Truths is the continuing story of the members of New Jerusalem Baptist Church. Reverend Bryant Jackson and his wife Cynthia bind together to execute their roles as pastor and first lady of an urban church after the death of his father. Bryant is determined to live up to his fathers legacy and make his own stamp on the churchs role in the community. But this proves to be a challengebeing a father and husband often takes priority over his responsibility of pastor.
Cynthia is finally off her high horse and focuses on her family. She comes to realize that she cannot be everything to everyone. Her main concern is closing the gap between her and Jennifer. Her relationship with her firstborn is her greatest concern, especially since Cookie wants to put her two cents in the collection plates.
First introduced in From Pieces to Peace, Camille and Chloe McMillian seek guidance from both the church and their mother, Esther. Camille and Chloe both see major life-changing events in SLRT. How they handle them will depend on their faith and new family members. The question Camille has is Can you be spiritually fulfilled and happy at the same time? She struggles not to focus on her surroundings but instead focus on the things of God. (Does Sly hold the answer to her question?) 
She demonstrates her spiritual growth when she opens her heart and home to Valerie Montgomery.
Charlotte holds too much pain for Valerie and Joshua. The violent death of Jonathan has left her brokenhearted. She relocates to Atlanta to have a fresh start and unknowingly lands right smack in the middle of Cookie and Bryants world.
Donna came from Detroit back to her childhood church home under sad circumstances. She found a lot had changed since she left Social Circle over thirty years ago. And why shouldnt it? She certainly was not the same. She truly found revelations of divine love and acceptance while she was thereso much that she packs up Aunt Charlene and moves back home to build a relationship with her father. However, sitting around watching paint dry in Social Circle is not her flavor either. She decides to reestablish what she knows best in Atlanta, except with more of an urban vibe. Just fifty more miles from her hometown, she finds more than she thought possible.
Remember James? No? You will.
Let me introduce you to the Harris family. Sybil and Zachery appear to be as solid as a rock, but even rocks can be broken. A blast from their past threaten to turn their glorious lives into dust. Will their faith in God sees them through?
I hope you enjoy reading the third tome of this series, Secrets, Lies, and Revealing Truths, as much as I enjoyed writing it, and I am humbled that you would take the time to share in my dream. May God bless you and your homes with His love, His grace, and His mercy. Give praise to Christ Jesus. Amen.
