  <title>The Story of Ada:  a Spiritual Journey Through Dreams - Mavis Aldridge PhD</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The Story of Ada was fueled by a yearning to understand more deeply who Ada really is beyond external appearances. From early adolescence to maturity, multiple dreams formed a hidden current of energy behind many of Adas professional activities, dreams which kept whispering their messages of something moreeven when, for lack of understandingshe ignored them while recording three volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sparked by the comment of a friend, Ada, in her retirement years, went on a relentless inner quest during which she realized that her dreams were, all along, a subconscious spiritual lifeline, supporting her on her lifes journey and revealing hidden aspects of herself which had inhibited her soul growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her arduous explorations culminated in an illuminating discovery of her personal elusive why of so many dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A blueprint for others to understand dreams as expressions of loving grace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Carolyn Tricomi, PhD &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applause and congratulations! An amazing job of collecting dreams and tracking Adas growth!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Connie Kaplan, PhD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An amazing document of deep, symbolic, and spiritual experience.&lt;/p&gt;
