  <title>House of Blue - Paige Millar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="House of Blue: Luminosity Beyond the ShadowsA Memoir is US writer Paige Millars relevant debut memoir chronicling her lifelong battle with major depression and the hurdles she jumps over to live symbiotically with the harrowing disease. Millar connects her depression to hormones in disarray and to her lifes obstacles. As the title hints, the author grew up in an abusive home, with which she shares a cross section of her storied existence with the reader. Millar also shares with us many of her lifes atypical anecdotes, some of which had a bearing on her depressive mood. She also honestly and transparently tells us the way her daughter came into the world: painlessly. In her memoir, Millar gives us a clear, concise path to bringing more well-being and happiness into ones life and describes how her toolbox of life-changing modalities (including neuropsychology, yoga, meditation, and Reiki) helped her transform herself from an emotionally scarred child to an accepting, fulfilled woman." />
