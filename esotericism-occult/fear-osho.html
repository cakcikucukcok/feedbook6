  <title>Fear - Osho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One of the greatest spiritual teachers of the twentieth century invites you on a journey through what makes human beings afraid--and how confronting fears strengthens us. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Fear: Understanding and Accepting the Insecurities of Life&lt;/i&gt;, Osho takes the reader step by step over the range of what makes human beings afraid--from the reflexive &quot;fight or flight&quot; response to physical danger to the rational and irrational fears of the mind and its psychology. Only by bringing the light of understanding into fear&#39;s dark corners, he says, airing out closets and opening windows, and looking under the bed to see if a monster is really living there, can we begin to venture outside the boundaries of our comfort zone and learn to live with, and even enjoy, the fundamental insecurity of being alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fear features a series of meditation experiments designed to help readers experience a new relationship with fear and to begin to see fears not as stumbling blocks, but as stepping stones to greater self-awareness and trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Osho challenges readers to examine and break free of the conditioned belief systems and prejudices that limit their capacity to enjoy life in all its richness. He has been described by the &lt;i&gt;Sunday Times&lt;/i&gt; of London as one of the &quot;1000 Makers of the 20th Century&quot; and by &lt;i&gt;Sunday Mid-Day &lt;/i&gt;(India) as one of the ten people--along with Gandhi, Nehru, and Buddha--who have changed the destiny of India. Since his death in 1990, the influence of his teachings continues to expand, reaching seekers of all ages in virtually every country of the world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
