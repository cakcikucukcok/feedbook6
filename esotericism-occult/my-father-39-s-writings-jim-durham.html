  <title>My Father&#39;s Writings - Jim Durham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In many ways, Jim Durham has lived the same life all of us have lived. He was raised by imperfect parents, involved in good and bad relationships, experienced a range of religious influences, and worked hard to be the best person he could be. But a few critical experiences brought the essence of his life out of the shadows. A chance encounter led him to a college he couldnt locate on a map (although Durham claims there is no such thing as coincidence). The death of a son and the challenges of raising a special-needs child are just a few of the powerful influences on his writing. His decision to leave the full-time practice of law, start a new career, and eventually start his own business are all addressed in &lt;i&gt;My Fathers Writings. &lt;/i&gt;You will learn lessons he learned, share in the struggles he endured. You will find references to writers and inspirational leaders ranging from Samuel Johnson, the Reverend Peter Gomes, and Wayne Dyer, to Ram Dass, Nelson Mandela, Buddha, and Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
