  <title>Saving the African-American from Cradle to Grave - Riccardo V. Haynes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My idea to write this book centers on the desire to educate my own people. Here, I am referring to the black African American man in particular. Although I may not be the most well-known Negro in America, I do feel that I have acquired certain knowledge that if widely dispensed and utilized will definitely have a positive impact on my brothers out there in America trying to survive. 
The information I intend to relay originates from my experiences in the world, my formal education, the Bible and religious studies, as well as my knowledge acquired in being a member of the most often discussed but most often misunderstood Secret Society of all time. I am referring here to the Masonic Fraternity (Prince Hall Affiliation), of which I have been a member for well over twenty years. 
Brothers, the time is now. Our time has finally come to advance and be recognized for who we really are and for the greatness of our legacy. Not since the year 2012 have we really been free to become everything that we once were and are destined to be in the future. I will explain the significance of this particular year and why it was so important to us later. In any event, know that you have the power. Use it to better yourself, your family, and mankind." />
