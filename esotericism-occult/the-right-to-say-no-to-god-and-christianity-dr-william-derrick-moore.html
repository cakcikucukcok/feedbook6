  <title>The Right to Say No to God and Christianity - Dr. William Derrick Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The Right to Say No to God and Christianity is abook that deals with the spiritual condition of many people today.There are a growing number of people who are exercising their God given right to say no tohim, hisholiness, love and truth. This group of people wants to experience the alternatives to God and righteousness. They have created a movement and lifestyle that exists without a holy God. &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-tab-count: 1&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;This movement promotesthe idea that &quot;this life is as good as it gets&quot; so enjoy what you want now because there is no life after death and certainly no consequences for your deeds while on earth other then from the civil authorities. This movement also exalts man as the only moral authority. The present condition of the world bears witness to what has happened to the world since man has taken on the roleas the truemoral authority. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;SPAN style=&quot;mso-tab-count: 1&quot;&gt; &lt;/SPAN&gt;A negativeconsequence of man being a moral authority is hissupport of the spiritual war thathas caused massive destruction to the moralstandards that God has ordained for us to live by. Many people are engaged in activities that can be characterized as open rebellion against God and his righteousness. God&#39;s morality is no longer a standard that must be maintained but a standard that can be altered to justify un-godly behavior. Sin feels good and many people want to feel good. They live their lives to please the desires of the flesh. They do thisregardless of the eternal consequences that we all must face for our actions. This book serves as a guide for Christians to follow during this time of open rebellion against God.&lt;/P&gt;" />
