  <title>One True Home - Behind the Veil of Forgetfulness - Claire Candy Hough</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since the beginning of time, humankind has been asking the same questions: Why are we here? What is our purpose in life? What happens to us when our bodies die? Claire Candy Hough explores these mysteries and more in her remarkable new novel, One True Home-Behind the Veil of Forgetfulness. Follow the adventures of one extraordinary heroine as she lives through many lifetimes, each a step on the path to spiritual awakening and self-realization: a princess in ancient Egypt, a peasant with the power to heal in medieval Scotland, a spoiled, pampered courtesan in renaissance Venice, a slave captured in Africa and brought to colonial America, and a native American of the Lakota tribe, finally ascending to the angelic being she was always meant to be. More than just a series of fascinating earthly experiences, One True Home shines a light on the biggest mystery of them all: what happens to us between incarnations? Is Heaven real? Claire Candy Hough answers the last question with a resounding &quot;Yes!&quot;, pointing to her own connection to Spirit during two near-death experiences. The author brings an extensive background as a clairvoyant and intuitive counselor to craft a story that is accessible and down-to-earth, as well as highly imaginative and deeply spiritual. At times thrilling, heartbreaking and tenderly romantic, One True Home is among those rare books that is both a page-turning tale and a work of profound wisdom and insight. Ariel is a heroine you won&#39;t soon forget, and her earthbound adventures and spiritual evolution will stay with you long after the last word has been read. A must-read for seekers of all ages and walks of life, One True Home is destined to become a classic of new age literature." />
