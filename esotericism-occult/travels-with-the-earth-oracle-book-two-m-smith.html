  <title>Travels with the Earth Oracle - Book Two - M. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Travels with the Earth Oracle- Book Two continues where Book One left off, with more spiritual adventures trekking the world with the Earth Oracle to work with the fifith, sixth and seventh chakras of the planet, as well as those energy centers in ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Earth Oracle is a woman who has the ability of sensing and communicating the spirit of places, and giving voice to a treasury of knowledge from soul teachers and planetary beings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;With the Earth Oracle&amp;#39;s remarkable abilities, we could interact with the energetic presence of every location, engage in verbal conversations with the sites and the consciousness held there, which could be quite fierce, confrontational and glorious.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come join us as we cross vast deserts, climb sacred mountains, and journey from an evil cave to the Eye of God. Along the way you&amp;#39;ll be meeting prophets, warriors, giants and ancient souls, stretching your consciousnesss in startling ways, and coming home with nine laws to help guide your life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Book Two is woven with excerpts from recordings of the Earth Oracle&amp;#39;s work sessions with the fifth, sixth and seventh chakras of the planet, along with the experiences we gathered and the spiritual wisdom we gained.&amp;nbsp; The book includes a number of photographs and illustrations to help readers visualize the places we visited, and the soul-body integration terms and techniques we were taught along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The trips were not solely intended for our personal awakening or healing, but also to expand our awareness of the planet&amp;#39;s soul. To learn how we are as much a part of the Earth&amp;#39;s life and its spiritual journey as it is a part of ours.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
