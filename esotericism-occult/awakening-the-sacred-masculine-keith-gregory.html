  <title>Awakening the Sacred Masculine - Keith Gregory</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The purpose of awakening your Sacred Masculine, is to ignite and guide you to live more consciously from your open, aligned and empowered Heartspace. This in part, is done by restoring respect, integrity and honor in men and strength, safety and trust within women. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is largely accomplished by consciously connecting into your Heart Center and all the Spiritual energies accessible here, specifically those of love + joy + compassion + gratitude + forgiveness and trust. Here you tap directly into your Divine nature. Guaranteed. These energies, found in an empowered Heartspace are what I refer to as the Sacred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living from your empowered Heartspace actualizes your Souls true purpose  which is to embody and express your Sacreds attributes in your everyday life. As you act from this awareness and become consciously present in your Heartspace, you come to awaken your Sacred. Its this simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, only by being totally present in this very moment  Here &amp; Now  fully grounded in your body, can you embody your Sacred. Viscerally speaking that is, with each breath you breathe. For your Sacred to become real for you, it has to become alive in you. Consciously breathing your Sacred and all its qualities into your body, will a Divine fusion ignite and blaze in your life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please understand, awakening your Sacred Masculine is IN NO WAY gender specific. Its not just about men. This revolutionary+evolutionary breakthrough of consciousness needs to take place in all of us, women as well. The masculine Lifeforce lives in men and women alike and as such, has to evolve in anyone intent on awakening their Sacred. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paradoxically, this applies to men engaging and empowering our contradictory + complimentary natures. Otherwise known as our feminine consciousness. For men, to awaken and embody our Sacred Masculine now, well have to embrace this fundamental part of ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
