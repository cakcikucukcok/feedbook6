  <title>Life Is an Opportunity - Becky Mulkern, Nd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We are living in an evolutionary time of opportunity and transformation. Those who step up and stand for their heartfelt desires may experience an amazing new future. Though you may be experiencing anxiety, PTSD, powerlessness, or poor health, it is time to heal emotionally, physically and spiritually. Break free from stress, old patterns, and limitations. As you quiet your mind and transform old worn out judgments and belief systems, you can heal trauma. This releases fear and powerlessness as well. You can then find peace of mind, joy, and gratitude. Through new, conscious, and empowering choices, you create opportunities for growth, evolution, and healing. In turn, you experience the healing power of unconditional acceptance and love, the creative power of prayer, and the joyful celebration of life. You can trust and have faith that the universe is supporting and guiding you on your way toward unconditional acceptance, love, healing, and joy. Create miracles in your life and feel blessed to know your heart-based inner self, your connection to the universe, and the amazing miracles that are awaiting you. Life is an opportunity!&lt;/p&gt;" />
