  <title>Crossing My Rainbow Bridge - Carol Ann Arnim</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Carol Ann will open your heart to all that is possible within yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Linda Ann Hirsch, Stott Pilates Certified Instructor&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join Carol Ann as she meets her true love while working as a cook on an oil rig in northern Alberta, Canada. Pregnancy results and the turning in of their son for adoption. Many years later she and Robert are blessed in marriage and reunite with their son while living in Arizona. Prior to their fourth wedding anniversary, her love succumbs to lung cancer. Serendipity guides her to raising five service dog puppies. Along with her own two labs, Saber and Spook, each dog in turn and together heal her heart as she navigates the maze of grief. Her husbands devotion from the other side comforts and restores her back to her truest self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to a dog, she is gifted a relationship with Elisabeth Kubler-Ross, author of On Death and Dying. She gives voice to her dogs, working through the aid of animal communicators to ensure mutual understanding. Each dog, as well as herself, are always treated as spiritual beings, rather than as a dog or human having a spiritual experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Savor the humor of her departed husbands mischievous spirit moving things about and whispering in her ear through an owl or through entering the body of her guide pup in training. Learn why her dog Treasure is afraid of balloons but loves to pop them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow her as she returns to her home of Canada to Vancouver Island. She is guided to cross the Canadian rainbow with her three labs to the shores of Prince Edward Island on the east coast. She emerges triumphant from her gift of trusting in her heart and the guidance of her dogs and divine spirit. Inspire yourself as you walk in her shoes and the paws of her beloved four-footed angels.&lt;/p&gt;" />
