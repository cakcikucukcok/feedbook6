  <title>The True Meaning of Christ&#39;s Teaching - Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The whole of Christ’s teaching is summed up in the prayer he gave us: the Lord’s Prayer. In this book Omraam Mikhaël Aïvanhov demonstrates and explains this. ‘An Initiate,’ he says; ‘follows the methods of Nature. A tree with its roots and trunk, branches, leaves, blossoms and fruit, begins life as a minute seed but if you plant it, water it and expose it to the warmth of the sun, it becomes a tree of majestic proportions. Nature, in her own wonderful way has condensed a tree’s entire potential into one tiny seed. Jesus did the same. He took his Teaching, the new Science he was bringing mankind, and condensed it into a prayer to his Father, in the hope that this seed would take root in men’s souls, be nurtured by them and grow into its full potential: the massive fruitful tree of Initiatic Science, the true Teaching of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;" />
