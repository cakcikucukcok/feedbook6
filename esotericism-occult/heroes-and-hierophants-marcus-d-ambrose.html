  <title>Heroes and Hierophants - Marcus D’Ambrose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Heroes And Hierophants is the culmination of a year of innovative writing from three of today&#39;s hottest underground authors. The plan was simple: each week one of them would propose a topic, and they would each have a week to write about it. Then the next week another would give a topic, and so forth for the whole of the year. From this simple high concept beginning, Marcus D&#39;Ambrose, Douglas Palermo and Noel Rogers took the project into directions entirely unprecedented. From serious god knowledge to rape jokes, the fearless trio push the envelope, lift the skirt of reality and explore the boundaries of the written word. What is already described as &quot;a bold and visionary experiment in 21st century literature&quot; (The Milville Times) and &quot;perhaps the first look at a new integral method for the evolution of the species into cosmic awareness&quot; (The Dobbs Ferry Clarion) is finally ready for download into your consciousness. Are you ready for it?" />
