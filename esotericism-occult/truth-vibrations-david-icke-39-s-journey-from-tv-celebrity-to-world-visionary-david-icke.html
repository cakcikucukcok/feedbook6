  <title>Truth Vibrations – David Icke&#39;s Journey from TV Celebrity to World Visionary - David Icke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Truth Vibrations&lt;/i&gt; is the first book in New Age visionary and conspiracy theorist David Icke’s series of groundbreaking expos&amp;eacute;s of the mysteries of life, the possibilities for the future of humanity, and the history of the global conspiracy known as the New World Order.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;On 29 March 1990, David Icke visited a healer. What happened that day and in the months that followed changed his life forever. The former professional footballer, TV presenter and Green politician found himself on a wondrous, transformative journey of discovery. Guided by master souls from other dimensions, he went to Canada, the United States and all over Britain, meeting sensitives and helping to balance the disturbed earth’s energy systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This journey led David Icke to write the explosive &lt;i&gt;Truth Vibrations&lt;/i&gt;, a revelatory book which looks at the great mysteries which for centuries have baffled scientists, doctors and historians were unravelled for David Icke: why are we here? What is the truth about God and Jesus? What happens to us when we die? What are crop circles and who makes them? Did Atlantis exist? Most importantly, David Icke reveals who the Illuminati and the Babylonian Brotherhood are, exposing a global conspiracy that has been controlling the fate of the world’s people for century by keeping it in a state of mass hypnosis.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But David Icke’s &lt;i&gt;Truth Vibrations&lt;/i&gt; also offers hope, through his new vision of the world and his prediction for an Age of Aquarius. Through his visions, David Icke has learned what is to befall humanity and what steps we can take to reduce the physical and emotional impact of the enormous changes that are about to confront our planet and all life upon it. During his spiritual journey, he discovered the truth vibration, an energy frequency which can break us out of our hypnotised state and allow us to face the challenges of the twenty-first century. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Many of the events he predicted in the eye-opening &lt;i&gt;Truth Vibrations &lt;/i&gt; over 20 years ago have since come to pass, making David Icke’s extraordinary story and the message that &lt;i&gt;Truth Vibrations&lt;/i&gt; brings to every man, woman and child of supreme importance to the future of planet Earth. It is a must-read and will change your view of the New World Order forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;i&gt;Truth Vibrations&lt;/i&gt;: Table of Contents&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;Introduction&lt;br/&gt;&lt;li&gt;Guided by the Light &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Life After Life &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Letters from the Gods &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Grand Design &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Spirit of the Stones &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lord of the Age &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Diamonds in the Mud &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Journey to Aquarius &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;New Vibrations &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Message &lt;/li&gt;Notes&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
