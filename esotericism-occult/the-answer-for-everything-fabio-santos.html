  <title>The Answer For Everything - Fabio SantoS</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In The Answer For Everything, Fabio Santos presents the latest discoveries of traditional science by establishing relationships with the concepts of modern Spirituality in a work that can be used as a study guide, both for beginners and for those who are already familiar with the subject.&lt;br/&gt;
Amid basic concepts of how the universe, our planet, the dimensions of reality, and how it all affects our lives today and now, complex subjects such as Quantum Mechanics and Sacred Geometry are explained in a practical and easy to understand way.&lt;br/&gt;
It is also possible to understand the role of religions a little better in the history of mankind by raising questions about what are known as &quot;conspiracy theories&quot; as extraterrestrial contacts and the control that a supposed “Occult Government” exercises on Earth.&lt;br/&gt;
In a simple and fun language like a chat with the reader, The Answer For Everything serves as a guide and encouragement to delve into the most important issues to our spiritual growth, showing some of the many paths we can follow for the so-called ascension, reaffirming that it depends only on ourselves.&lt;br/&gt;" />
