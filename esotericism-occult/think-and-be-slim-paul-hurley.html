  <title>Think and Be Slim - Paul Hurley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
This book has been written for anyone who wants to achieve his or her health fitness goals. Whilst it has chapters dealing with both exercise and nutrition, it is NOT a diet or exercise book. The subject of this book is how to program your brain to achieve your goals. Every action and subsequent result begins with a thought. By changing the way you think, you change the way you act, the results you get and ultimately the way you feel about yourself and your life. We all behave according to our internal programming, much of it installed early in our childhood. Such programming determines our beliefs, habits and self-identity. This book will explain methods by which you can discard negative, limiting programs and replace them with positive, empowering ones that have been used by others to achieve incredible results.
&lt;/p&gt;
