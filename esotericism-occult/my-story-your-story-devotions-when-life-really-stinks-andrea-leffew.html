  <title>My Story, Your Story—Devotions When Life Really Stinks! - Andrea Leffew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Devotions for When Life Really Stinks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Divorce, adultery, domestic violence, illness, death - and the list goes on. Life is not easy or pretty all the time. Sometimes it just plain ol&#39; stinks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But how do we feel about these difficult times in our lives? When we look around, it seems like other women have no problem dealing with life&#39;s disappointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They don&#39;t have tear stained faces or puffy eyes. Their hair is washed, styled, and they are dressed nicely. Do they ever struggle with the trials of life? Are they hiding their pain? Do they ever want to scream and throw things?&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you a bad person because you want to crawl into a hole and never leave?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is a collection of devotions from women who have faced the ugly times in life. Who are not afraid to admit life is not easy. Yet, they tell of the peace they have received from Christ during their trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are not alone in your struggles. Let My Story, Your Story give you some comfort. You will know that other women have faced similar difficulties and survived the fires of life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
