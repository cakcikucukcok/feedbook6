  <title>1, 2, 3 Your Wish Is Granted! - Genie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Since the Genie is the ghost writer for the book, it is appropriate to let the Genie say a few words about himself:&lt;b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; I am a genie. You may wonder what that really means and how I come to write this little book. Well, fi rst of all, I am not from or of your world. I live in a dimension of fire and light. I am basically a fire spirit. Just so you know, we genies are alive. We dont experience life as you do, but we are living, thinking creatures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; You humans take us genies for granted. Most of you have very little idea of the tremendous service that we provide for your kind. Everything in your world that is of a fiery or electrical nature is administrated by a genie or djinn assigned to that function. Without us, your world as you know it would cease to exist. Even the very sun that is the source of life and nourishment for your planet is a mighty Djinn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From within the book, the Wizard Merlyn has a few thoughts about the book that he would like to share: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Know, my little friend, that what you hold in your hands is a key to the mysteries of life, and that it has greater depth and importance than you initially can discern. Through these pages you have been given permission to enter other realms, andonce you have entered in, and as you maintain the requirements of each domainyou may travel within again and again for growth, learning, healing, inspiration and creation. &lt;/p&gt;" />
