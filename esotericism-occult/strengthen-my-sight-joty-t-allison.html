  <title>Strengthen My Sight - Joty T. Allison</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Your destiny is calling you and you must answer. Many of us do not know how to respond when destiny calls. Our perspective clouds our judgment and allows us to make safe decisions rather than following the direct will and purpose that God has ordained for us before the foundation of the world. Because of your perspective, you may have wasted precious time, which temporarily placed a halted on your destiny. In this inspiring book, your life will be transformed as you discover what your purpose is and how to stay focused on it until you recover everything that belongs to you. It does not matter about what your social economic status, sexual orientation, or your race might be; God still has a purpose for your life. The power that is within you must be revealed because generations of people are waiting for you to come alive and live out the essence that the creator had intended for you. The best days of your life will start the moment you place a demand on your life and make a conscious decision not to merely exist, but to exist on purpose! You may not have reached the level of success you have been aiming for, but fear not because your best days are ahead of you. If you are a person that is discouraged because your reality does not align with Gods promise then get ready to live the life you have been waiting for. If you are ready to move to the next position of your life than this is the book that will give you the motivation and spiritual understanding to make your life change from natural to supernatural." />
