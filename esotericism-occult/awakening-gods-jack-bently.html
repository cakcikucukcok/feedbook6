  <title>Awakening Gods - Jack Bently</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In his sequel to The Last Enemy: Teachings From Beyond the Veil, Jack Bentley continues sharing his wisdom and revelations regarding spiritual ascension that ultimately encourages others to seek their own truths through what is spoken or confirmed to us internallyfrom the source of all truth.&lt;p&gt;
Bentley, who began his spiritual journey in the Christian denominational churches in the mid-1950s, calls himself nothing more than a messenger. After he was ordained into ministry some thirty years ago, Bentley says he was summoned by the spirit world to watch, listen, and record messages from the spirit realm. While sharing valuable communications from his spirit world teachers that touch on ways to overcome many common challenges such as illness, financial fears, and negativism, Bentley also offers anecdotes, relatable excerpts from the King James Version of the Bible, and quotes from many spiritual masters and other sources. &lt;p&gt;
Our Father is once again speaking to men and women who are prepared to listen. The incredible messages shared in Awakening Gods will help anyone on a quest for spiritual truths find growth, enlightenment, and a real connection with the deeper self." />
