      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ari Mason is a shunned and exiled witch. She works as a bartender and reads tarot in the park. Neither of which requires her brand of black magic.

By using herbs and plants in her spells, instead of blood, she can help those around her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the temperature rises in Houston, so does the body count. But these aren&amp;#39;t regular murders; someone is using old magic to take out humans and witches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ari realizes that any witch is fair game and sends out a call for black magic and white magic witches. They must join forces to fight this ancient evil if any of them plan on making it through this Beltane alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
