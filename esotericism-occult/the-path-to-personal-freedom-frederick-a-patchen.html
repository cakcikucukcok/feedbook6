  <title>The Path to Personal Freedom - Frederick A. Patchen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What I share in this book is my mission in life. That is why I refer to myself as a missionary. There is a second reason for this idea. I believe that we each have a sage who lives within our spiritual being in life. It is as if this sage cannot be found because of the fog of day to day living. We must learn how to be quiet and listen to our own heart in understanding that we can identify those things around us that are positive at all times. Each of us has a voice that some call a conscience, some call a guide, and some call an angel. It is something intelligent that looks out for us and lets us know if we are getting into trouble along the way.
 I very deeply feel that this inner sage also has a mission. This sage is our own inner missionary. However, this inner missionary is unlike any you may have heard of in the world around us. This missionary will never infringe. It teaches by the example I want to share with each of you. We must learn the power of not infringing on others or allowing them to infringe upon us. As this is their mission, they will not infringe upon any choice you make in life. They allow you to experience the result of that choice on your own in order that you might learn that different choices bring different results into our life. I will use the word sage and missionary interchangeably throughout this book." />
