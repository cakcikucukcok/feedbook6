  <title>All Gods Battle Amazing George - Hilton McCabe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Amazing George lives a life of bad and good religious choices. His conscious life seems confused. Yet, he finds powerful forces guiding him to where he is most uncomfortable. He knows he is flawed with failure, posessed by dangerous ambitions, and confusied by memory shadows. He wanders seemingly without purpose, while moving with the relentless guidance of 
people and events. You may see your own religious beliefs lived or distorted. Innocently these sneak into Georges living, but they come as if by some design.
He finds a variety of people, rejecting and accepting them carelessly. His own life plans give way to horrific events, as well as the most uplifting. Somehow, he keeps on his way without personal direction. Hes  clumsy, comical, tragic, and, perhaps, hope filled. He is his own person without suspecting his own destiny, until a burst of clarity renders him amazing. A patient reader will get his or her amazing reward for loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;" />
