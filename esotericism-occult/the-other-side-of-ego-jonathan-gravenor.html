  <title>The Other Side of Ego - Jonathan Gravenor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I used to believe I was a pretty big deal. I had achieved fame and a level of power that allowed me access to people I considered important. As&amp;nbsp;a broadcast journalist, I was recognized and admired. It was seducing, and I became swept up in all things that were me and no-one else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then suddenly it all ended when I was diagnosed with a deadly disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My awakening happened the night my doctor told me I had throat cancer, my daughter told me she didn&amp;rsquo;t care if I lived or died, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t blame her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly isolated in a world that only contained my imminent death I realized the kind of man I had become was exactly the kind of man I would not want to be near.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surgeries, Chemotherapy, and radiation were painful but paled in comparison to the internal savagery of my own mind, as I started on the journey to heal myself and salvage my soul. To do that, I had to change just about everything I believed in. I traveled around the world looking for answers and trying to find out who I was. But the global exploration wasn&amp;rsquo;t as intense as the internal journey that led me back through the darkness and then eventually into a place of reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
