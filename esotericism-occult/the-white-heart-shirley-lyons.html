  <title>The White Heart - Shirley Lyons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is my account of finding a mystery man for four years. His name is Sri Aurobindo, a great spiritual leader. I found a portrait of him in an Ashram in India and in finding him I found myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I looked up and there in the corner of my bedroom, blinking off and on for some time as if it were on a poster size, black and white television screen was the portrait of a man. Sitting up in bed, slightly slapping my face to make sure I was awake, the words, &quot;Who is this man?&quot; came into my head. Answering myself, sprang the words, &quot; I don&#39;t know who he is, but I think he is a philosopher who lived in the eighteen hundreds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While watching in wonderment, I realized three normal human reactions: intense heat, hearing a voice, and seeing a face. I knew I wasn&#39;t crazy, just dumbfounded. This was an apparition! Are they really real? Who would believe me? And what if anything did it mean? &lt;/p&gt;" />
