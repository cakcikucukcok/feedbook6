  <title>After Eden - C. M. Houck</title>
      <meta name="description" content="According to scriptural myth the story of the species known as man began with &quot;the man&quot; being expelled from the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:23-24). The journey that &quot;the man&quot; embarked upon was physical life, and every being that has ever been born has continued that journey of self-discovery. This is the simple premise upon which &lt;I&gt;After Eden&lt;/I&gt; is structured.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Although each poem, verse and entry stands as an individual composition, it is when they are read in sequence that we gradually realize that they are actually relating small parts of a larger multi-faceted picture. Almost reluctantly the attention moves from simplicity and innocence into the sensual frailties and harsh realities encountered with life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The result is a very personal approach to life&#39;s experiences as related by one who dares to sometimes question the hollow shibboleths that pass as spiritual insight. Life&#39;s diversity is celebrated by this life traveler who is a special blend of pilgrim, vagabond, maverick and seeker of rational belief. He discovers that life&#39;s intended destination is found in accepting the universal essences that we each embody." />
