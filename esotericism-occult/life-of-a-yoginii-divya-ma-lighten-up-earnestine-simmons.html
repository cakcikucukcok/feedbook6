  <title>Life of a Yoginii - Divya Ma Lighten Up, Earnestine Simmons</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A deeply inspirational book,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Life of a Yoginii&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is as simple as it is profound. Divya Ma&amp;#39;s writing is straightforward and captivating for readers from adolescent to senior. As a shy girl, she, like many of us, experienced her first sense of the Divine in nature. She loved to be with the trees. So much so, that she wanted to study agriculture, but her mother asked to find something more feminine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As she struggled through different courses at different schools, she was drawn to the gentleness and sweetness of friends who talked to her about meditation, and that was the beginning of her journey along Ananda Marga, the Path of Bliss. Divya Ma eventually became a yogic monk and one of the pioneers who introduced yoga in the U.S. public schools in the 1990&amp;#39;s.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She later retreated to nature again, spending ten years living alone in a solar-powered yurt, where &amp;quot;every experience [was] so precious to my heart and soul. Sometimes during rainy days, I would revel in the freshness of the air, and I&amp;#39;d dance and dance in the beautiful open space of my home. My heart felt merry to be filled with love, joy and peace.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further transformation, healing and change brought Divya Ma to find her spiritual partner, Gopala. What has never changed for her is the enthusiasm and childlike innocence with which she embraces each day. Taking up the colors of her life, she paints a picture of the human heart&amp;#39;s eternal dance with the love of the Divine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
