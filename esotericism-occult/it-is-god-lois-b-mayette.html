  <title>&quot;It&quot; Is God - Lois B. Mayette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It Is God is about changing the way we culturally see God and ourselves. 
Everything is energy, or it is nothing was said by Albert Einstein. 
If God is everywhere and everything and is constant, what is God? Not who is God. 
God is not a person or human but the essence of everything, which can best be described or explained as being energy. 
The hope of these writings is to help us in the twenty-first century with the marriage of spirituality and science. This author is not an expert in either field, but after many years of studying through reading some fifty books a year about human development and history and with the lack of growth, she saw the need to let go of old thinking and move into a new paradigm or model. 
Hopefully, this book can help us more in the death and dying issues. What goes with you upon death? Not your possessions or title or body. So what is spirit/soul?
