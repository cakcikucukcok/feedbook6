  <title>What Not to Say to Someone Not Expecting - Lisa A. Murray</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;&gt;After 20+ years of battling infertility, Lisa decided that it was time to share what she has learned. Through the past two decades she has heard it all, tried it all and has the puncture marks and surgery scars to prove it. If you are currently on the fertility merry-go-round, this book may help you to know that there really are people out there who understand what you are going through. If you have a loved one that is currently longing for that positive pregnancy test, use this book to learn what is helpful and what is hurtful during such an extremely emotional time. Lisas journey may have lasted longer than some, partly because of how much she desperately longed for a child and partly because of how much she hates to fail at anything! Being a credentialed minister taught Lisa that God had a plan and purpose that she could not see and did not always understand. During this time, she also learned how to be patient. God helped her turn her desire for a child into a desire to help others going through their fertility journey. Lisa wants to help families and friends understand how to be supportive without being condescending and how to be encouraging while still remaining genuine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;And, of course, what&lt;/p&gt;
