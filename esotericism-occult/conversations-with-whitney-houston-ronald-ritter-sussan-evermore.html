  <title>Conversations with Whitney Houston - Ronald Ritter &amp; Sussan Evermore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whitney Houston is one of the best-selling musical artists of all times. Her career, personal life and marriage to the high profile singer Bobby Brown is well documented. This amazing talent sadly passed away on February 9th, 2012 at the young age of forty eight, her lifestyle and better judgement fatally colliding in a hotel room at the Beverly Hilton.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whitney makes contact and clears any doubts about her passing, addiction to drugs, husband and the people who were important in her life. But it is not primarily about these events, as we discovered, she has a clear and passionate message for her daughter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are a number of references specifically directed to her daughter Bobbi Kristina to read and find comfort. It&amp;#39;s a message from a loving mother who wishes to connect with her only child beyond the physical to explain the event that was her passing. The spirits of Whitney and Bobbi Kristina will always be intertwined.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whitney tells us she left unexpectedly and could not say goodbye but this is a chance to communicate and eventually complete her passage to the other side.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though Sussan and I were not followers of Whitney&amp;#39;s career, we enjoyed and respected her talent, she was iconic and a modern day diva. This book is not about the mega star Whitney Houston, it is about a grieving mother who misses her daughter and did not get her opportunity to say goodbye in her own way. This message is hers and hers alone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As a channeler Sussan allows the non-physical entity, in this case Whitney Houston, to enter and transfer her message using Sussan&amp;#39;s vocabulary and emotions. We do not exercise any judgement or have an opinion because for us, we are only here to relay the message." />
