  <title>Your Holiness - Debbie Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction by Marianne Williamson&lt;br/&gt;Foreword by Arielle Ford&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recently discovered unpublished work by the beloved spiritual teacher and #1 &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author in which she reflects on the astonishing holiness that resides in each of us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;What you are seeking at the deepest level exists inside of you, in the quietude of your own inner world, in the privacy of your own sweet heart. So now it&amp;#8217;s your responsibility, your holy responsibility, to encode your consciousness with thoughts, feelings and images that will support you in creating the perfect internal environment to cultivate a deep and intimate relationship with the one you call God. This is the force that loves you, cheers for you and wants it all for you. In a world where love leaves as quickly as it comes, you can rest now, knowing that you have found a love that will never leave you, never misguide you and never ever let you down. My advice, dear friend, is take great care of that Love. It will give you everything you&amp;#8217;ve been looking for.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the fifth anniversary of her death and written during her long battle with cancer, &lt;em&gt;Your Holiness&lt;/em&gt; is a thoughtful and poignant exploration of the godliness that resides in all of us. Infused with her trademark frank honesty and keen insight, it is a blueprint for recognizing and accepting our latent spirituality. Debbie combines motivational prayers with deeply personal stories about her own spiritual journey&amp;#8212;how she struggled and eventually found her internal faith&amp;#8212;and translates her experience into a practical path for transformation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Engaging and accessible, clear and unwavering, philosophical yet practical, &lt;em&gt;Your Holiness&lt;/em&gt; is a gift to the soul that both guides and nourishes. At a time when so much in our world feels uncertain and suffering is widespread and persistent, Debbie&amp;#8217;s voice is more essential than ever. &lt;em&gt;Your Holiness&lt;/em&gt; grounds us in the here and now while delivering a timeless and empowering message of relentless love and strength.&lt;/p&gt;" />
