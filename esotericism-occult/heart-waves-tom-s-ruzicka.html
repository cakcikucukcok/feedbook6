  <title>Heart Waves - Tomás Ruzicka</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book will forge a new connection between you and your heart. It will foster the development of your talent and guide you to its use. Author Tomas Rika shows you a step-by-step approach and levels to access before you can connect and harmonise your heart with your mind.   It is a truism that, under pressure, winners exhibit winning behaviour and losers exhibit losing behaviorbut how do winners develop the strength of mind that separates them from otherwise equally talented losers?   The answer to that question is to be found in this book. A lifetime of tennis coaching has provided Tomas Rika with the opportunity to observe tennis champions and tennis also-rans on an up-close-and-personal basis. He has now distilled what he has learned on the court in the pages of this book. Athletes, businesspeople, and all who are fed up with a life lived in second place will find this book a valuable addition to their library.&lt;/p&gt;
