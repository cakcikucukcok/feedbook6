  <title>Insight of Today - Y Begby</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Do you want a heightened wakefulness, greater understanding, and an open and freer mind?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Insights of Today, author Y Begby gives you a tool to raise your awareness and become more attentive not only to yourself but to the ongoing life around you. By involving yourself and exploring these reflections, you can improve your conditions with yourself and people around you. Insight of Today is written with humor, depth, and love. The theme is a mixture of everything, just as in life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our daily life, there is a lot of stress. It is soothing to have a book of short insights from which one can choose. Insight of Today can also be used for inspiration and enrichment. You can pick a page at random and reflect upon what that specific insight means to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The willingness to learn not only from your own past but also from the experiences of others is what makes you a winner. It also gives you opportunity to feel spiritually at peace, both with yourself and with the world in general. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insight of Today is a book that you can keep around and open up to any page for a little boost in your day!&lt;/p&gt;" />
