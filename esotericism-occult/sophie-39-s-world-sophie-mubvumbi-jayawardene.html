  <title>Sophie&#39;s World - Sophie Mubvumbi Jayawardene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sophies World; journeys of the lost soul is about the life I lived.
I had been confronted with an issue of a new disease that no one in the world knew what to do. The disease is not the only problem I was to address, but I was also pregnant at the time with twins.  Unfortunately, I had moved to this country the previous year with my husband and two young children
This matter was left to the authority to decide what they were to do with me and my unborn babies. 
It is about how the problem was solved that send me into a very dark place. I had been given five years to live; fortunately, I out lived this period. The story is about if I had only known what I know now.  It is about what I did to survive. It also about what I discovered about living in general. Above all, the miracles that exist in this world I live in. In the end, my story had to be told to the world because the story has a massage for everyone." />
