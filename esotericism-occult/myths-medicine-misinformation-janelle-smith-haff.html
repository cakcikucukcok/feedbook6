  <title>Myths, Medicine &amp; Misinformation: - Janelle Smith-Haff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Unbridle the caring spirit of humankind through the spirit of the equine.
Does the soul communicate with little girls through the spirit of the horse to begin the process of awakening females to their power?  Is this why little girls experience a pink phase and a horse phase? Did the myths of yesteryear involving women and horses serve a spiritual purpose, or was their purpose solely to subjugate the power of women?  Does the horses reputation as being a forgiving animal lie in the fact that it sees in humans the same energy that exists in the energy of the Divine?
Intertwined in Jellybeans continuing spiritual journey is a comprehensive primer for the newbie horse owner and owners of new horses on the cradle-to-grave care of the whole horse.  Is the homeopathic remedy Ledum a successful alternative treatment for horses afflicted with headshaking syndrome?  Is antioxidant therapy an alternative to joint supplement therapy for the treatment of arthritic conditions?  How does the pH balance affect a horses arthritic condition?  Are the three most important and most basic nutritional needs of horses being provided by owners?
With Universal guidance, Jellybean leads you into a self-empowering equine-human relationship; one that combines the powers of will and desire with T.I.M.E.E. (time, insight, money, exhilarating, exhaustion).  Read and learn how to find that space within your self, as it is in this space where youll become best friends with your horse, and so much more." />
