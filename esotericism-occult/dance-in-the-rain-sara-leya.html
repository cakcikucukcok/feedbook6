  <title>Dance in the Rain - Sara Leya</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Little did I know when I was born all the pain I would see and feel. My turbulent journey, seeing my Nanas heartbreak to the day I lost her, through my own teenage heartache where I wanted my life to end, and then to being on a life-support machine after a car accident a few years later. Upon recovery, I entered a dark world of being a victim of domestic violence from which I had to make a dramatic escape. Finally, when things seemed more settled, I fell in love with a guy with a big secret. After many insights, I received from the obstacles that seemed insurmountable on my journey. I always felt in my heart that triumph would overcome adversity &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through all troubles, try dancing when it rains, as I have over and over again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The epic, suffocating turmoils of Saras life all had a gift in them, yet she didnt see clearly until she was much older. The painful experiences of childhood, teenage years, and onwards were all, she realised, created by her thoughts and beliefs. Many years of unfathomable emotional turbulence finally left her with the deep ingrained belief if only we all treated each other as we would wish to be treated, then this world would be a more positive place.&lt;/p&gt;" />
