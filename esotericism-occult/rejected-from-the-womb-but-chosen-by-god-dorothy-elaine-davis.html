  <title>Rejected from the Womb, but  Chosen by God - Dorothy Elaine Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I am Jamaican and this is my story.  The book tells about my life experiences and how I have been able to maintain my faith through lifes challenges.  Through my experiences, I understand that even through hardship you can triumph if you keep God first.  Your trials do not control your life forever and we must not give up.  We all face struggles daily and while you may not connect with everything about my story, it is my hope that my book will help you to realize that as long as you have faith in God, you will make it.  If you are blessed by my book, please share with your family, friends or even a stranger you pass along the way.  
I encourage feedback from my readers to share with me how the book affects their lives and how they connect to my story. Your input is important to me and I ask you to email at churchofgodbibletruth@gmail.com.  
I am also available for counseling and would love to speak to parents about how important it is to believe in your children and uplift them with love and kindness each day.   Remember the child that you mistreat, could become the feather in your hat.
Most of all believe in God and know that He is able to bring us out of the prisons and dungeons of our minds.  We must emancipate our minds from low self-esteem, rejection and abuse.  As I mentioned, there will be continuing chapters.  I am borrowing the words from my good friend, the late Robert Nesta Marley, whom I received much inspiration and encouragement fromOne Love." />
