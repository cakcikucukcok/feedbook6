  <title>The Inspired Journey - Alexis Mason, Sandye Brown</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A woman begins her spiritual journey through her heart.  It is this heart connection that allows women to reach out for guidance as they move deeper within for spiritual discovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Inspired Journey&lt;/i&gt;, authors Brown and Mason provide women with a nurturing, yet challenging, guide to lead them through their essential journey to God.  The journey is an experiential one. Women will be inspired through the myths and stories within each chapter, as well as through the revelations of the authors own life lessons.  Journaling and meditation exercises serve as useful tools to help women uncover the blocks that keep them from tapping into their God-given greatness. &lt;/p&gt;   
&lt;p&gt;Whether studied alone or as part of a womens study group, &lt;i&gt;The Inspired Journey&lt;/i&gt; empowers women to choose more consciously, to listen more deeply, to surrender more willingly and to awaken more joyfully. &lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;Deep within each womans heart, the soft voice of Eternal Spirit longs to be acknowledged.  &lt;i&gt;The Inspired Journey&lt;/i&gt; offers women the opening to hear the voice and respond to its urgings by creating a passionate, spirit-filled life. &lt;/p&gt;" />
