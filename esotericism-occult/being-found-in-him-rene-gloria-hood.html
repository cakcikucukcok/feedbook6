  <title>Being Found in Him - Rene? Gloria Hood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Throughout the years of spiritual warfare, she has never laid her sword down. She has fought day in and day out the good fight of faith. In spite of being told by man she would not live to see forty years of age, and all the distractions that came her way, she always reminded the heavenly Father of His promises to her. This book is a must, you have to read and see for yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brenda Green, personal assistant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apostle Rene is the best example Ive personally experienced of someone who walks in the fullness of the abundant life God has for us. Her realness helped make God more real for me, and I know her testimony in this book will help make Him real to others also.&lt;/p&gt;
