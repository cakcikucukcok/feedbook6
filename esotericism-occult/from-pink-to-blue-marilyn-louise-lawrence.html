  <title>From Pink to Blue - Marilyn Louise Lawrence</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Children are born with it; most adults have long forgotten it. Now is the time to reawaken your Truth of Being and Life Purpose.&lt;i&gt;From Pink to Blue &lt;/i&gt;is a divinely guided message initially designed to enlighten the purpose path of children by creating a knowingness, awareness, and concept in the adults around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much to the authors surprise, this concept deeply touches the very essence of purpose and awakens a truth, not only in children but in every person who reads these words, including herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This truth has been hidden deep inside, shut down, suppressed and closed in a dark room since a young age, when one felt a need to protect oneself based on the words and actions of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, you will learn that helping a child with a life purpose path is just the beginning of what can be accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The time is now for awakening the injured child inside of people, so the healing process can begin for the betterment of all.&lt;/p&gt;" />
