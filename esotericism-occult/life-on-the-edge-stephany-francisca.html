  <title>Life on the Edge - Stephany Francisca</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Life on the Edge&lt;/em&gt;, author Stephany Francisca chronicles her path to finding a formula for a true life that has enabled her to meet and exceed her own objectives. As she recounts her personal memories and experiences from childhood to adulthood, she synthesizes the patterns that she followed to accomplish her life goals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;To her, the pattern is clear:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;You do because you dont know better (ages 45).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;You do because you want to change the undesired outcome to a desired one (ages 610).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;You dare yourself to do more and push your boundaries each time you succeed (ages 1415).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;You keep daring but with pre-damage control you take bigger risks (ages 19-22).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Author Francisca definitely took the road less traveled as she challenged everything from eating broccoli at six to being allowed to live on her own at fifteen. She talks about the challenges of fighting conventional wisdom, and of determining her own fate as opposed to letting her fate be dictated by others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Life on the Edge&lt;/em&gt; is about following your dreams and living life to the fulleston your own termsby creating your own path in life and then following it!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
