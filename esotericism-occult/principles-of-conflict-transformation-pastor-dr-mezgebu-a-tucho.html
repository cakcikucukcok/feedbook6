  <title>Principles of Conflict Transformation - Pastor Dr. Mezgebu A. Tucho</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book will outline a theological transformative approach that is effective in resolving congregational conflict and has shown that, in the question of how the contemporary congregation might address conflict, the answers lie not only in the process James taught his audience in his chapter four of hus epistle but in a deeper understanding of the kind of kingdom Jesus embodied and his expectations of how its members would live with a clear sense of their own standing before God and one another. 
It will develop a dialogue between conflict theory and theology to create a solution that helps transform conflict into positive outcomes. Conflict transformation is a new approach to conflict resolution that attempts to describe what ought to happen in conflict more precisely. It is a step beyond conflict resolution and points toward a deep transformation in the conflicting parties, stopping the issues that trigger violence and allowing peace in relationships. Resolution focuses on the present conflict or issue and finds the solution. Transformation focuses on the people involved in the conflict and their permanent relationships with each other.
Conflict transformation occurs only when true wisdom reigns among people in congregation. It agrees with Vayrynen (1991) that actor transformation is critical to transform conflict into something good and beneficial to the organization. However, unlike Vayrynen, it believes that, unless actor transformations occur, any other transformations (e.g., issue, rule, and structure) will be only temporary, and the conflict that had been controlled in the present will reemerge later on in the future unless the falsely wise members are replaced with truly wise ones." />
