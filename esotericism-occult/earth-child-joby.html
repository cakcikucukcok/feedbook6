      <meta name="description" content="THE WORLD OF MEN, WITH ALL ITS CONCEPTS

MYSTERY TO THE BOY. He understood the real world
around him, which was simple because the world told him
everything he needed to know about it. The grass grew
because it drank the water that fell from the sky and the
water fell from the sky because the grass couldnt walk to
a river like he could, it was all so simple.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In return for their life the plants blanketed the earth
making everything lush and beautiful, thus pleasing creation.
Animals grazed for a lifetime and when they died,
they fed the grass. Everything was alive and had everything
it needed to be alive; creation wanted life, loved life and
nurtured it dearly. There was no need to fight to survive,
all life was a gift and all life helped each other to live, and
did so without any conflict only natural balance." />
