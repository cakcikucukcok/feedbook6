  <title>Astrology - Zodiac, Ascending and Couple Affinity - François Arnauld</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Astrology is a complex of beliefs and traditions that believes that the positions and movements of celestial bodies relative to Earth on events affecting human collective and individual. Who practices astrology is called an astrologer and his divination is called horoscope.&lt;br /&gt;
The zodiac is a celestial band divided into 12 sectors of 30 degrees each extending approximately 8 &amp;deg; from both sides of the ecliptic (the apparent path of the sun in its annual motion) and comprising also apparent paths of the moon and of the planets.&lt;br /&gt;
The subdivisions of the zodiac are constellations in the zodiac signs in astrology and astronomy.&lt;br /&gt;
The measurement is based on the tripartite division of the periods between the solstices and equinoxes, and consequently this band is divided into twelve equal parts, each of 30 &amp;deg; amplitude, these zodiac signs.&lt;br /&gt;
The zodiac extends on either side of the plane of the ecliptic with a width of about 8 &amp;deg;, is essential because the orbits of the planets and the moon will not lie perfectly in the ecliptic plane.&lt;br /&gt;
The zodiac sign of a person is determined by the position of the sun according to the time, date and place of birth.&lt;br /&gt;
