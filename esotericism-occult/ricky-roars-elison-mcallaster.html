  <title>Ricky Roars - Elison McAllaster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the blink of an eye, another persons choices can totally change your life. When author Elison McAllasters dynamic youngest son was tragically killed in a car accident on New Years Eve, she declared to her family that they had to look for the positive and trust that more good would come out of that experience than negative. Little did she know how true that would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next twelve months, they had repeated, miraculous communications from beyond. From visits from sacred birds to instant electronic signals, their son, Ricky, let them know that he was still with themlistening, watching, and signaling his love and approval of their daily struggle back to life and laughter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These signs from beyond are unique because they have been witnessed by other people in varying conditions. Love never dies, and Rickys strength of spirit and creative ability to share love from another form will inspire and uplift anyone who feels detached from a passed loved one.&lt;/p&gt;" />
