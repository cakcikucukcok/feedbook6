  <title>The Intuitive in You - Christopher Alexander Burford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Christopher Burford may be the most gifted intuitive, psychic, medium, and viewer on the planet today. He has been a beautiful guiding light in my life and my students lives. And now I am excited that he put his teaching and experiences into a book so people can open the doorway to their natural gifts and live in the presence of self-love and mastery. I believe that this book will truly help people to manifest their destiny and be cocreators of harmony!

Chris is genuine; with his superior abilities and limitless wisdom he could change the way world leaders lead our world. Chris shows us the possibility of how we can transform, heal and live in the world today. Beth Lynch, medium
Christopher Alexander Burford believes we are all born with innate abilities that society grooms out of us as we age. The good news is that we can learn to control our energy fields just as we control our hands.
In a comprehensive guidebook of personal stories and teachings, Christopher leads others to open the doorway to their natural gifts and relearn the basics of controlling energy fields in order to drastically increase personal power, expand knowledge, and develop any skill imaginable. Through an insightful road map that incorporates his diverse energy experiences with clear explanations of chakras, auras, and crystals, Christopher teaches others how to
become aware and control energy fields;
conduct intuitive sessions;
heal with energy;
see and talk to angels;
develop higher functions like channeling, remote viewing, and astral projection; and
be in harmony with nature and its energy.
The Intuitive in You shares anecdotes, activities, and seasoned guidance from a trusted healer, intuitive, and psychic that encourages anyone to relearn how to control their energy fields to achieve a better understanding of themselves." />
