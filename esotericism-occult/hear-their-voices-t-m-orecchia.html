      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered if angels really exist in this day and age? Who really sees or hears them? Have you ever thought: Where are the angels when tragedy strikes? Why is there so much suffering on earth? Why is life so difficult down here? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hear Their Voices contains twelve different stories addressing current events such as cancer in children, suicide, war, and toxic oceansevents that are in newspapers and on TV. These are the kinds of events that may make you just shake your head, wonder why for a second, and say that is a tragedy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The twelve stories were channeled to the author by different angels. The names of each angel appear in the story which that angel dictated. Each story addresses an event with an explanation of what is occurring spiritually. The stories also emphasize that everyone is capable of conversing with the angels when we let them into our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;" />
