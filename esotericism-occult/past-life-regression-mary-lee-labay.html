  <title>Past Life Regression - Mary Lee LaBay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
The quest for self-knowledge and awareness has gained increasing popularity over the past several decades, with an explosion of beliefs and methodologies. Central to these practices is the exploration of past lives. From the curious layperson to the traditional doctor of medicine, people are employing various techniques in an effort to facilitate this experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Certified hypnotherapy instructor Mary Lee LaBay has written &lt;b&gt;Past Life Regression: A Guide for Practitioners&lt;/B&gt; as a comprehensive text for beginning as well as veteran therapists. Ms. LaBay covers both basic and advanced techniques in a philosophical context, to help practitioners generate maximum healing and change during the past life session. Through case studies and concise instructions, the author demonstrates practical and elegant uses of these techniques that allow the client to discover life purpose, aspects of their relationships, roots of disease, addiction, and phobias, as well as a wide range of other life issues.
