The writing is excellent, concise, and moves along very nicely. This very impressive narrative about Herman&amp;rsquo;s resilience is honest and not pretentious. It&amp;rsquo;s a love story as well. Herman has a great message that will resonate with people and embolden them to get up, try again, and commit to helping others. It&amp;rsquo;s awesome.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
