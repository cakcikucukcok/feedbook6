  <title>The Dream Channel - Joseph L. Stefani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The pursuit of happiness! &lt;br&gt;
    We have different perceptions of what that means  among ourselves, and &lt;br&gt;
    within ourselves  as we experience myriad events (joyous or otherwise)&lt;br&gt;
    such as - activities, relationships, activities, learning, challenges, contentions,&lt;br&gt;
    problems. Whether we automatically think of it or not, each of those events&lt;br&gt;
    contributes (positively or negatively) to our mental, physical, psychological&lt;br&gt;
    and spiritual development; for being happy is good, but being happy as we &lt;br&gt;
    develop is satisfyingly sublime. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
  This book, The Dream Channel is designed to itemize and explain various&lt;br&gt;
  aspects of the twenty-four Tools of Living we all have in common, yet
  that we, as individuals, are constantly treating subjectively in agreement with
  our differing (sometimes unstable) needs, desires, emotions, and values.   &lt;br&gt;
        The Supreme Being has loaned us these tools, and, through His gift of&lt;br&gt;
         dreams, urges us to utilize these taken-for granted tools so as to allow &lt;br&gt;
         us the mental, physical, psychological, and spiritual development  &lt;br&gt;
         of sublime happiness. &lt;br&gt;
              Here are 12 of the 24 primary tools, including examples of the&lt;br&gt;
              associated auxiliary tools s that are utilized in dreams:&lt;br&gt;
                 Resources  book, vehicle, money&lt;br&gt;
                 Space  interior and exterior&lt;br&gt;
                 Senses  sound, taste, touch, smell&lt;br&gt;
                 Illumination  light, darkness, color&lt;br&gt;
                 Order  clean, repair, tailor, reproduce&lt;br&gt;
                 Motion  walk, ride, drive, fly, fall&lt;br&gt;
                 Vegetation  soil, dust, lawn&lt;br&gt;
                 Climate  heat, cold, thunder&lt;br&gt;
                 Communication  thought, speech, gestures&lt;br&gt;
                 Intimacy  sexual activity, pregnancy, marriage&lt;br&gt;

Yes, these tools (over 160) are used in dreams; dramas meant for one  
individual only  private and personal dramas.
