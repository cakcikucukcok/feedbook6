  <title>The Venusian Trilogy / From Venus I Came - Omnec Onec</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Omnec Onec&#39;s book &quot;FROM VENUS I CAME&quot; is a unique classic in spiritual literature. It&#39;s her autobiography in which she portrays her life on the astral level of Venus. In a very detailed and clear way, Omnec describes the surface, the society, the history, and the life on the astral dimension of Planet Venus. Additionally, Omnec speaks about the adventure of how and why she decided to manifest a physical body, and about her journey to Earth in 1955.
FROM VENUS I CAME was first published by the US Col. and UFO Investigator Wendelle C. Stevens in 1991 in the USA. It was sold out very quickly.
OMNEC ONEC: &quot;As I was born on the Planet Venus in another dimension and came to your Planet as a young child, I was able to retain the knowledge and information that I had gathered as a Soul through many incarnations and life times. I can keep this information intact, and what I teach people is actually what I KNOW and not what I&#39;ve read about or what I&#39;ve heard, but what I have experienced through many different life cycles on Earth and in other dimensions.&quot; – &quot;We came as Soul into the polar worlds for only one reason: To have the experiences which will lead us to becoming a conscious co-worker with the Supreme Deity – the REAL LOVE. Real Love is the energy that flows from the creator and supports all forms of life. Without it, nothing can exist. Therefore we are all universal beings and not limited to one existence. There are no limits to love.&quot;" />
