  <title>Preface to Your Eternity: Unearth Your Sacred Knowing: SELFGnosis® Trilogy - Sharon Quinn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you wanting Soul-level, dynamic change?&lt;/strong&gt; Are you looking for an eternal, timeless message that reveals meaning, change, and growth from the cutting edge of TRUTH? Are you ready to shift from low gear into a Higher-Spirit gear?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If so, to fully realize yourself, you must really know your inner Higher SELF (your Christos-Spirit) as the person you&amp;#39;re closest to! So,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1. &lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;#39;t stop your enlightenment&lt;/strong&gt; with common tip-of-the-iceberg mistakes that dominate today&amp;#39;s most revered world traditions and beliefs.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2. &lt;strong&gt;Dare to go beyond&lt;/strong&gt; merely awakening so that you can &lt;strong&gt;live the grace of your forgotten reality&lt;/strong&gt; by being the Spirit you TRULY are!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3.&lt;strong&gt; Discover the bigger things&lt;/strong&gt; that await your Soul and&lt;strong&gt; get beyond the concepts&lt;/strong&gt; to merge with your Higher SELF, your Beloved Christos-Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Preface to Your Eternity&amp;quot; is the first book of &lt;strong&gt;&amp;quot;The SELFGnosis Trilogy,&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; which &lt;strong&gt;changes what it means to be HUman.&lt;/strong&gt; It does so with clarity, unlocking metaphysical conundrums and religious-spiritual straightjackets with everyday metaphors and profound insights forged from experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This trilogy presents a Catalyst for Carving a New Coastline in Consciousness (a real paradigm-shift with a Spirit Rehab and Renaissance healing-support system, far more productive than any worship paradigm). It has practical keys for overcoming the paradigm paralysis that accompanies truly new knowledge, thus, empowering its potentials to actualize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Learn what it means to create your Holy Resonance,&lt;/strong&gt; connect with an unheard-of Spirit-freeing process for your transformation, and get beyond merely the current spiritual status quo of life betterment, self-improvement, and disciplines of meditation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is an original-thought book debuting a paradigm-shift idea that&amp;#39;s about &lt;strong&gt;genuine spiritual fulfillment.&lt;/strong&gt; It is &amp;quot;cutting its teeth&amp;quot; on the edges of an era that is attempting to close its cycles of religious dependence and its gaps. This awakening awareness doesn&amp;#39;t quite fit established categories since it is making amazing breakthrough discoveries such as:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 1. How spiritual traditions are facing their end-of-life cycle.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 2. How &lt;strong&gt;ego transparency is the key&lt;/strong&gt; to unlocking your unknown.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 3. How to live for your eternity, not mortality, while living daily life.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 4. How meditation is merely transcending levels within your mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 5. How a newly advanced archetype opens vistas of awareness and opportunities for unparalleled, deep growth.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; 6. How you actually need to transcend the mind itself to regain your lost knowingness and InSpirited abilities (Gnosis)!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With your SELFGnosis&amp;reg; Inquiry your Holy Resonance (your InSpirited-free Consciousness) can live in your daily shoes! Live it and get beyond just dreaming or praying for it! All this has the added benefit of dealing with and overcoming the forbidden death reality. We&amp;#39;re born and eventually die. This reality is best dealt with from the beginning of our life. Learn how easy it is to not fear death--way cool, too!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This book has on-page footnotes for an uninterruptible reading experience, an instructive Glossary to enhance your understandings, 15 illustrations, and a 33-page cross-reference index to aid learning and digesting this life-altering change in perception, insightful understandings from universal Principles, and what qualifies for your acceptance. You deserve to know the TRUTH free from its &amp;quot;wooly blankets&amp;quot; (man&amp;#39;s way of diluting info to make it comfortable, less probing overly generalized). Read it. Be informed.
