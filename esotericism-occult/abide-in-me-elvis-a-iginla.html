  <title>Abide in Me - Elvis A. Iginla</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The readings in &lt;em&gt;Abide in Me&lt;/em&gt; were put together to highlight the human need for daily focus. The verses in the Bible were selected to shed light on the essence of our humanity: we are a physical reality with free will and with significant appreciation of the consequences of our actions. Our physicality is a force to be reckoned with, in that like lower animals, the human person is driven by selfishness. Consciousness enables us to appreciate the consequences of our actions and together with free will, enable us to choose what we do. To overcome the force of our animal nature we must muster a spiritual force and this is best done on a daily basis. As Christians we are called to follow in the steps of Jesus who prayed and meditated daily. Sooner or later we come to realize that the greatest peace of mind and happiness is derived from love and from learning to live in good faith with others. Once we accept this we can begin to better appreciate our spirituality. The hope is that we will form an unbreakable habit of daily devotion.&lt;/p&gt;" />
