  <title>Tormented By Ghosts: True Life Experiences - Lynda Bogert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a book written about true life paranormal experiences and encounters with ghosts and otherworldly entities. The ethereal anomalies follow and attach themselves to people creating paranoia and chaos in normal peoples&amp;rsquo; lives.&lt;br /&gt; Lynda has been dealing with the phenomena for over thirty years seeking guidance and help from various mediums and psychics to get answers to deal with the paranormal. She has developed her own spiritual abilities over the years to assist her in warding off negative and evil ghosts to protect herself and her family.&lt;br /&gt; From Out of Body Experiences (OBEs) to encounters with both good and evil ghosts to a Near Death Experience (NDE) and communicating with spirit guides, you will read spine-chilling accounts with the other side.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; She wants to be normal, but the spirit world has other plans. Tormented by Ghosts is a true story about unfortunate encounters with ghosts and other otherworldly paranormal phenomena that have greatly affected Lynda&amp;rsquo;s life. The struggles include harrowing encounters of unwanted Out of Body Experiences (OBEs), her Near Death Experience (NDE), her horrifying visit from a demonic apparition, and mysterious bone-chilling ghostly visits. This book encompasses her thirty years of coping to learn and educate herself to understand and utilize her spiritual abilities and tools to help herself and others. Her daily battle is to overcome the paranormal and control the abilities that she has been given! Is she seeing and hearing ghosts that may have a message for her or to let themselves be known or to simply taunt her? This is a story with many stories. You&amp;rsquo;ll want to sleep with the lights on because it could also happen to you, too&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
