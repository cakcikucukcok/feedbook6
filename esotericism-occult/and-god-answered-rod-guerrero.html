  <title>And God Answered.... - Rod Guerrero</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;We often allow ourselves to get defeated in sadness, depression, despair, loneliness, and, ultimately, self-destruction. These are terrible places to be. But there is a way out of those places, and that is through Gods love and trust, along with belief in yourself. In &lt;i&gt;And God Answered &lt;/i&gt;, author Rod Guerrero offers a discussion of how to turn negative thoughts into positive energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presented as a back-and-forth conversation between Guerrero and God, this study provides a serious and thoughtful discussion of topics relevant to the lives of all beings that inhibit and share our world. Guerrero maintains that to be mired in negativity is an exhausting waste of energy and that life is meant for joy and not struggle. We can fill our lives with love, peace, and prosperity by building on the inexhaustible supply of love that exists in all of us. You can unleash that authentic power within you and set yourself free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Including original poems, &lt;i&gt;And God Answered &lt;/i&gt; communicates that any negativity can be bridged over to the positive by stilling your thoughts and communing with God to redirect your thoughts and create as you desire.&lt;/p&gt;" />
