  <title>The New Mysticism - Keith Hill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The finest emotion of which we are capable is the mystic emotion. Herein lies the germ of all &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;art and all true science. Anyone to whom this feeling is alien, who is no longer capable of wonderment and lives in a state of fear, is a dead man.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;ndash; Albert Einstein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For millennia, mystics&amp;rsquo; explorations of reality were considered a religious quest. This changed during the Victorian era, when researchers began redefining mystical experiences as psychological phenomena.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No longer strictly religious, mystical experiences came to be seen as grounded in anomalous perceptions, involving experiences or events that provide a breakthrough from our everyday view of reality to another more insightful&amp;nbsp;level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith Hill proposes that anomalous experiences lie at the heart of the new mysticism. In this illuminating study, he examines the historical and cultural developments that have contributed to a radical shift in mystical practice. He also weighs what is required for the fostering of what Einstein called &amp;ldquo;mystical wonderment&amp;rdquo; to be sustained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith Hill is a New Zealand writer whose work explores the boundaries between mysticism, history, science, religion and psychology. He is a three-time winner of the Ahston Wylie Award, New Zealand&amp;#39;s premiere prize for spiritual writing.&lt;/p&gt;" />
