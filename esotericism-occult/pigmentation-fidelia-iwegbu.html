  <title>Pigmentation - Fidelia Iwegbu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is there anything that has not been turned into colors? Or is there anything that could not be turned into colors? How far can we go with our love for beautiful colors? We all have favorite colors which make it easy, when we walk into a shop to buy things that comes in many colors; we just opt for our favorite colors without being overwhelmed by the many colors.&lt;br&gt;
Colors have transformed how we see the world around us and it looks different to us today than it did to previous generation that for example watched black and white television. Our world is now saturated with different kinds of colors. As we look around us and loving the colors and enjoying what we see, we must not fail to give credit to what allows us to see the colors which are lights. According to scientist Sir Isaac Newtons research, it defines color as a perceptual characteristic of pure light that passes through a prism. And, the lights composed of many colors. He found that each color is made up of a single wavelength. And, because objects absorb certain wavelengths and we perceive these wavelengths as color.&lt;br&gt;
Color has a powerful force in our lives. And, can also have a powerful effect on our bodies and minds. Further experiments demonstrated that light could be combined to form other colors. Red light mixed with yellow light could create an orange color. Surprisingly when you mix color like yellow light and beautiful purple color light, a white light appears.&lt;br&gt; 
If you have ever painted, then you have probably noticed how certain colors can be mixed to create other colors. As I have experimented myself, it is easy to mix paints to make a new color using the main primary colors like red, blue and yellow. When two colors are mixed it result:&lt;br&gt;
Red &amp; white = Pink&lt;br&gt;
Red &amp; Green = Brown&lt;br&gt;
Red &amp; Blue = Purple&lt;br&gt;
Blue &amp; Yellow = Green&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book both natural and man-made colors or as we perceive colors will be discussed and analyzed in full detail.&lt;br&gt; 
You will be surprised what you can discover.&lt;br&gt;
So, take off the load, sit back and enjoy&lt;br&gt;
THE REALITY BOOK.&lt;/p&gt;" />
