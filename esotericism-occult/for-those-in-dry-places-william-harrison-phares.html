  <title>For Those in Dry Places - William Harrison Phares</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Yes, there is a way to experience joy in ministry again.
Sixteen hundred ministers are either terminated or leave the pulpit every month. Alienation and isolation afflict ministers who now sojourn in spiritually dry places. You might be one of the statistics, wondering if you will ever be able to escape the wilderness and be useful to God again.
In &lt;i&gt;For Those in Dry Places,&lt;/i&gt; William Phares presents a personal and biblical understanding of how spiritual dry places occur in the lives of ministers and how to avoid them. For those already there, he shares the way to move back into Gods call and experience a second opportunity.
A seasoned pastor and evangelist, Phares explores personal and biblical principles, offering ways to
	recognize the road signs warning of approaching wilderness;
	avoid becoming the scapegoat for congregational dysfunction;
	find hope when experiencing the Silence of God;
	hear Gods voice of guidance again;
	enjoying the ministry the second time around.
I highly recommend &lt;i&gt;For Those in Dry Places,&lt;/i&gt; which comes to us in absolutely supreme timing. Many pastors today are going through dry, tough times and can hardly see light at the end of the tunnel. Dr. Phares addresses what to do when you are in this positionhow to deal with your thoughts and what to do, day after day, to get out of your current difficult situation and stay out.
