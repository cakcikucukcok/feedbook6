  <title>My Living Will - John Trautwein, Joe Girardi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;My Living Will is the story of former major league pitcher John Trautwein, and the unbelievable tragedy which befell him and his family when his fifteen-year-old son, Will, took his own life. There had been no warnings, no obvious signs of anxiety, depression, or unhappiness; nothing. A family and a community were left stunned as they pondered how a young man like Will Trautwein, a healthy, happy, popular, athletic, and musical teenager, who came from such a loving home, could lose the will to live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Trautwein writes straight from the heart. And his words will save lives. The story Trautwein shares in these pagesa remarkable journey of passion and purposewill literally save lives.&lt;/p&gt;
Jeffrey Marx, Pulitzer Prize winner and author of Season of Life 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;John Trautweins story inspires hope. It empowers people, and it gives its readers the hope for life. The triumph that this story imparts arouses the goodness in everyone as it drives people toward action.&lt;/p&gt;
Joe Girardi, Manager, The New York Yankees
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my twenty-two years of broadcasting, I have told many stories of triumph over tragedy, but the story of Will Trautwein and his family has stayed with me. The loss of such a vibrant young man and the strength of his family to use their heartache to help has had an impact on how I parent my daughter, and how I report stories of teenage depression and suicide. This is a must-read if you have a teenager in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
Stephany Fisher, Anchor, CBS News, Atlanta
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever wonder if a young person in your own home might be at risk? Read this book. In My Living Will, John Trautwein takes the emotions of loss and turns them into a message of awareness and hope. A must read for parents and teenagers alike!&lt;/p&gt;
