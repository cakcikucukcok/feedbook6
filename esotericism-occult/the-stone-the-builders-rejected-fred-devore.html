  <title>The Stone the Builders Rejected - Fred DeVore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Finally presented in one little volume; a manual easily understood and written with much prayer and consideration for all people everywhere. This little book is sure to open up new insights into the foundations of the new world, exposing the utter futility of ever expecting the kingdom of God to appear upon this planet, without the effort of each one of us transforming our very thought patterns and re-thinking many of the sacred misconceptions we have all cherished and held dear for so long.
Prepare to experience a complete revolution within your own being, as we build together the long awaited kingdom of God right within our own mind-body-temple, looking for new heavens and a whole new earth.
This little volume is the result of many years of true hunger and an unquenchable desire to know the one and only true God. It is with great delight that I now send this beautiful message of love and light forth into the world on the wings of divine love and true heart longing to see all people everywhere experience true love for God, self and neighbor as ones own self.  
Together may we all turn towards the light within our own beings, loving and honoring all humans as the true sons and daughters of God that each one truly is and rebuild the ancient foundations of human civilization according to the original pattern, a timely addition to the vast stream of new information pouring into human consciousness today." />
