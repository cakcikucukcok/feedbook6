  <title>While the Stars Are at Play - Jennifer Rogers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Children already know better than we do that mysticism is real and divinely simple, but they sometimes need reminding of their sacred place when facing real-life difficulties. This book is meant to inspire children (and the adults who read it with them) to remember their connection to all things light and wonderful in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jennifer Rogers has written a stunning spiritual childrens book unlike any other!  &lt;i&gt;While The Stars Are At Play&lt;/i&gt; is filled with hope, inspiration, and guidance.  This book is a reminder that light is at the core of every child, and thus a source of self-worth, self-healing, and self-trust. There is no greater gift that she could share with the precious beings who will one day be the caretakers of our planet.  Although my children are older, they absolutely loved it and have reread it more times than I could count.  This is a must-read for every child...and a perfect book to share! &lt;br&gt;
Kim ONeill, channel, speaker, columnist, and author of &lt;i&gt;How To Talk With Your Angels&lt;/i&gt;;
&lt;i&gt;Bond With Your Baby Before Birth&lt;/i&gt;; and &lt;i&gt;The Calling: My Journey With The Angels&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;While The Stars Are At Play&lt;/i&gt; is fundamentally about the goodness of creation and is a work of spirituality that reminds us what is most important.  It reminds me of Psalm 150 and the Book of Psalms in general with its words of praise.  I am also reminded of a quote, attributed to mystic and Sufi poet Hafiz, about a particular star  the sun -- Even after all this time, the sun never says to the earth, you owe me.  Look what happens with a love like that.  It lights up the whole sky.  This book emphasizes all that we have been given is a gift, and that there is nothing else we should do but live lives and speak words of gratitude!
