Search for one&#39;s soul is a difficult road but there is light at the end. The path whether religious, humanistic, mystic or scholarly or work centered releases energy within and creates opportunity to break out of our shackles. Sincere effort is rewarded with direction, provoked by unfathomable forces. As one traverses the path of self discovery milestones have no meaning, but what matters is to find wings to fly. Enlightenment is the Secret to Fly, wrestles with &quot;Who am I&quot;?
