  <title>Hear and Fear - Moillah Ndoro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this book is to help you understand that hear and fear is a Principle of the Kingdom of God. The Gospel of the Kingdom of God that Jesus Christ preached was all about repentance. This book also contains very rich scriptural references that confirm that, the Word of God is the name of God. Revelation 19:1213 says, His eyes [were] as a flame of fire, and on his head [were] many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself. And he [was] clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called the Word of God. 
This book also helps us to understand that God is a Spirit, therefore we should worship him in spirit and in truth. As a believer, refuse to be a destitute of the truth because before God there is no excuse. This book also helps us to understand that we cannot replace the Gospel of the Kingdom of God (repentance) with the Gospel of Prosperity. It does not work! But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you. No time to waste. Repent! 
This book is also written for all those who are changing the truth of God into a lie because whether you like it or not, the truth of God is the truth of God. We cannot do anything against the truth but for the truth. All we can do for the truth is to believe it! Beloved brethren, there is nothing new under the sun; whatever you are going through in your life, be it sickness, disease, poverty, generational curses, or bondage, all is vanity of vanities. It is only the mercies of God that are new every morning. 
This book is for those who are willing to understand that we should fear God, and keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man because God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil. Let the Church (you and me) be the true Church of God ruled by holiness and righteousness, not by dollar power." />
