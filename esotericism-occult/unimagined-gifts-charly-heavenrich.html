  <title>Unimagined Gifts - Charly Heavenrich</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;TRUE STORIES OF ORDINARY PEOPLE GOING TO EXTRAORDINARY PLACES. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Is it possible to spend time in a natural place like the Grand Canyon and walk away with the gift of a life-changing experience? In &lt;i&gt;Unimagined Gifts&lt;/i&gt;, a seasoned Grand Canyon raft guide shares the stories of ordinary people who came to the Grand Canyon for an adventure vacation and found themselves accomplishing extraordinary feats, forever changing their awareness of what is possible. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Charly Heavenrich transports you on a Grand Canyon adventure through the eyes of his former passengers, sharing compelling stories of what can happen when one travels to the edge and learns how to go beyond it. Youll meet a nearsighted boy disoriented without his glasses, a middle-aged woman on her first vacation, an English couple out of their element, and an Israeli lawyer on a journey towards self-discovery, among others. Youll be inspired by their attempts to break through self-imposed limitations, drawing strength from one of the most wondrous natural landscapes in the world. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The compelling tales in &lt;i&gt;Unimagined Gifts&lt;/i&gt; demonstrate that all who travel through the Grand Canyon will come out on the other side having learned more about themselves  and their capabilities  than they could have imagined. &lt;/p&gt;" />
