  <title>Life, Death, and the Birth of Truth - Caroline Byrd</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;What sort of life would you live if you no longer feared the dying process? Do you want to understand?&lt;/P&gt;
? Where do we go when we die?&lt;/br&gt;
? How does the crossover happen? &lt;/br&gt;
? Can our loved ones in spirit make contact with us? &lt;/br&gt;
? Should we be afraid of dying, and what happens next? &lt;/br&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;Life, Death, and the Birth of Truth&lt;/i&gt; is a journey through Caroline Byrds experiences as she communicates and works with souls and spirit on both sides of the veil.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt; Life, Death, and the Birth of Truth&lt;/i&gt;  begins with the death of a close family member, sharing in detail how we can understand and connect with those who have crossed over. Learn how and why loved ones who pass may continue to play a role in your life today. Deep insights are uncovered, showing you how a soul has the opportunity, prior to death, to reveal their final moments.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt; Life, Death, and the Birth of Truth&lt;/i&gt;  will lead you through the doorways of existence, exposing the truth behind the veil. This is an opportunity for you to understand how the process of dying is not a single moment but a journey of healing, sharing innovative and revolutionary experiences that can help you understand the dying process.&lt;/P&gt;" />
