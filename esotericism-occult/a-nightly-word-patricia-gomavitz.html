  <title>A Nightly Word - Patricia Gomavitz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you a spiritual explorer?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;For over three years, Patricia Gomavitz has channeled pragmatic spiritual concepts through a series of nightly messages from the causal entity Joseph, and in this book, she shares those teachings with you the same way Joseph has given them to her: one word at a time.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Each night the message begins: &quot;&quot;Good evening. We are here with you.&quot;&quot; Joseph then elaborates on a word of their choice-struggle, gratitude, faith, and many more-illuminating the spiritual implications of each word, and how you might apply this knowledge to improve your everyday life. As an entity that exists on the causal plane, Joseph has an exalted vantage point from which to offer advice for life here on the physical plane as well as insights to what lies beyond. Joseph has provided these incredibly rich and complex spiritual teachings in an easily accessible format with straightforward language and an eye toward the practicality of understanding such concepts so that they may be used.&lt;/p&gt;  
&lt;p&gt;If you are searching for teachings that resonate, you likely have a vibrational curiosity that allows for this study, a drive Patricia is familiar with as a life-long spiritual explorer. She knows what it&#39;s like to yearn for teachings that fit like a key in a lock, and she hopes that all who are receptive to the information offered here will find it naturally, and be uplifted. The student discovers the teacher when he is ready to learn, and if you are drawn to this book and its wisdom, Joseph just may be the teacher you seek.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;From antiquity, the great spiritual masters haveeach in their own wayuniquely articulated the one common thread that is found in every sacred text, irrespective of the faith; that we are all a part of something far greater than ourselves, and that when we are open to It, we receive impeccable and comforting guidance and wisdom. In A Nightly Word, Pat Gomavitz proves she is listening and she graciously shares a sacred continuum of thoughts, beliefs, and ideas that will enrich your life and make the world a better place.&lt;/p&gt;
