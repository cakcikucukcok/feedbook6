      <meta name="description" content="A thousand years ago the Mayas created a map of the world. At Chichen Itza they built temples to represent the nations of the Western Hemisphereincluding a replica of modern day Washington, D.C. Their Temple of the Bearded Man stands where the Lincoln Memorial would stand in the future, and their memorial wall of dead soldiers was built where the Vietnam Wall would stand. Their France temple describes Frances Gaelic and German invasions, and their tectonic plates show major earthquake zonesincluding one along the Rio Grande Rift. Uxmal (meaning, The Future)the map of the Eastern Hemisphereshows Asian men in parkas on The Great Pyramid (Mt. Everest), Beijing as the home of fortunetelling, and a major earthquake in Qinghai. Overall, however, the map focuses on Americathe United States; and the Mayan creation myths describe the creation of Americanot the creation of earth. Even Omeyocan, the Mayan paradise, sounds suspiciously like, American. Did an American space-time traveler trick the Mayas into believing he was a god? Is that why they built the Yucatan Hall of Records?" />
