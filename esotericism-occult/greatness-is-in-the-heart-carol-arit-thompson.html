As blessed cured; I survived being scammed and duped in 2008 by a dubious conned artist. I was also being told 2010 by the Hematologist, Caroline, I think you have cancer and that power of love of God changed that too. I thank God, this for my healing; I am inspired to be highly motivated to help others to know His good works and press on! 
Through faith and that power God is He is wonderworking spiritual power and the very real and true when you call on His name is only way to touch Him and receive healing.
