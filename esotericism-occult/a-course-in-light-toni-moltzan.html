  <title>A Course in Light - Toni Moltzan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout many disciplines of spiritual growth, light is mentioned as the source of all life. Those who have experienced enlightenment describe it as being aware of everything that surrounds them as energy and light. The light energy referred to within A Course in Light is not a symbolic term but the actual light energy of your own soul and body of light. Through the meditations and lessons, light magnifies and is directed throughout the physical system for transformation and change. 
The first level focuses on the physical body and your material surroundings and acquaints you with the different egos and bodies that are aspects of yourself. Your personality ego and organic and cellular egos are individual and collective intelligence that have been impressed with your mental and emotional experiences. These egos are acknowledged during meditation to help bring unity within. When vibrations of all the bodies are in harmony, you experience a wonderful new wellness, strength, and clarity. 
What makes this different from any other course? The direct experience you feel, sense, and become aware of during meditation. Energy surges through your body, mind, and soul during your sessions. It is a path healing every aspect of your body and its egos. This course takes you step by step through your personal clearing. 
Based on the ancient teachings of Agni Yoga, this is a bridge between all spiritual paths." />
