  <title>Time Journey to the Origin and the Future - Mariana Stjerna</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Time Journey to the Origin and the Future is the independent sequel to Mariana Stjerna&amp;rsquo;s well received novel On Angels&amp;rsquo; Wings.

Now you have to throw off all your prejudices and put on a shimmering garment, which brings you into something that you in your wildest dreams could never have imagined,&amp;rdquo; said Master Melchizedek when he informed us about the mission. &amp;ldquo;This journey is a lesson about what the cosmos really is,&amp;rdquo; he continued, &amp;ldquo;or the original cosmology, if you think that sounds better.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We may, among other things, come along to one of the seven Super Universes, which revolve around a static Central Universe, and make visits to the following cultures of origin: the Mayas, the Maoris, the Incas, the Aztecs, the Sumerians, the Inuits, the Zulus, the Etruscans, the Basques, etc., all of which have been or still are represented on Earth. The book concludes with a visit to the Central Race and the WingMakers, who are living in a paradise &amp;hellip; without violence, female maltreatment, lust for power, or greed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
