  <title>Snatches of Life - Neil Primus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This manuscript is a compilation of original works. Folklore, legends, culture, fact and fi ction are all used to bring these pieces to life. Some of our folk lores and culture are refl ected in a Perfect Christmas, Ma Lotties Farewell, Old Haigue a Fly, The Called and Fraid De Dark. Guyanas beauty and natures gifts are weaved into pieces like An Outing in the Country, A Wild Ride and Life in my Neck of the Woods. Life and its triumphs and failures and peoples unpredictability are recorded in stories such as Plumber in the House, Pets are Us, The Days Goes Floating By, Needle in a Haystack, Rum Till I Die and Two is a Crowd. Humour
fl ows through many of my stories and is quite evident in the following pieces. Catch a Bull By the Tail, Flight of the Bats, Going Going Gone!, King Thief , Rooster Rendezvous. Appointment with Dr. Punch, Making my Melody, Patrick the Prankster, Repeat After Me, The Awakening. Millicent. The Young and the Wild, is based on true events. Fiction and adventure are captured in The Coming of a King and Strange. Written in simple language these stories are often upbeat and capture the imagination
of the readers young or old. Readers can journey through many aspects of Guyana and its people and reminisce on days forgotten. Snatches of Life is a must read for children and adults." />
