  <title>Tribute to Tagore - Yasmin Faruque</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Rabindranath Tagore is the life force of Bangla literature. His contributions to the cultural life of West Bengal and Bangladesh are beyond measure. In fact, there is no area of Bangla literature that he did not touch. He composed more than 1,000 songs, including the national anthems of both India and Bangladesh; numerous dances such as Shyama, Chandalika; plays such as Raja, Raktakaravi; 200-plus short stories like Drishtidaan, Kabuliwala; many essays and letters; and last but not least, a dozen witty, pithy, and insightful novels, such as Naukadubi, Bou Thakuranir Haat, in addition to numerous volumes of poetry exploring a number of issues.
I pay my tribute to Tagore with translations of some of his beautiful stories. I hope my tiny effort pleases my readers, and that they forgive any mistakes that I may have made inadvertently." />
