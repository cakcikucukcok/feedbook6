  <title>The &#39;&#39;F-Student’S&#39;&#39; Compilation of Short Stories - Joseph McLinden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This first collection, called the F-Students Compilation of Short Stories, is designed to give encouragement to all students, especially those in middle school and high school, who feel that they cannot prevail in a society that expects a modest level of literary competence. The big secret is that there is no big secret. Just pick up a seventh-grade grammar book and learn the basics of English. Rule number 1: keep your dictionary and thesaurus close at hand. Read whatever interests you, but read. Dont force yourself to read boring or dry text. Look up words you dont know; use them in your own writing and never give up on something you really want to do. YOU are the key to your life. I hope you enjoy these stories, which were designed with all secondary students in mind." />
