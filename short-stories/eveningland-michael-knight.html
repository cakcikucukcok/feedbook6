  <title>Eveningland - Michael Knight</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;&amp;#147;Michael Knight is more than a master of the short story. He knows the true pace of life and does not cheat it, all the while offering whopping entertainment.&amp;#8221;&amp;#151;Barry Hannah&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Long considered a master of the form and an essential voice in American fiction, Michael Knight&amp;#8217;s stories have been lauded by writers such Ann Patchett, Elizabeth Gilbert, Barry Hannah, and Richard Bausch. Now, with &lt;I&gt;Eveningland&lt;/I&gt; he returns to the form that launched his career, delivering an arresting collection of interlinked stories set among the &amp;#147;right kind of Mobile family&amp;#8221; in the years preceding a devastating hurricane.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Grappling with dramas both epic and personal, from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to the &amp;#147;unspeakable misgivings of contentment,&amp;#8221; &lt;I&gt;Eveningland&lt;/I&gt; captures with crystalline poeticism and perfect authenticity of place the ways in which ordinary life astounds us with its complexity. A teenaged girl with a taste for violence holds a burglar hostage in her house on New Year&amp;#8217;s Eve; a middle aged couple examines the intricacies of their marriage as they prepare to throw a party; and a real estate mogul in the throes of grief buys up all the property on an island only to be accused of madness by his daughters. These stories, told with economy and precision, infused with humor and pathos, excavate brilliantly the latent desires and motivations that drive life forward.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;I&gt;Eveningland&lt;/I&gt; is a luminous collection from &amp;#147;a writer of the first rank.&amp;#8221;(Esquire)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
