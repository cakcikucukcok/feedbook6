  <title>Rendezvous - Reginald de Palm</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is a collection of short stories, written from dreams and pictured images. Brazilian Roulette is one of them and is completely based on a dream, containing very little editing. It is about one scene where the action starts shortly after the first words are read and never stops thereafter. In this story, there are no specific heroic acts toward the crime itself, but theres a rescue of a scooter taking place that catapults the protagonist into following the bad guy and capturing all the action on video, which is streamed from a drone to the Internet. All of this brings the adventure to a twisting end.
Then there is the Under Water story that is based on a picture of two rescue personnel, who posed in front of a half-sunken car in a river behind them. This triggers the story to be written about what is not in the picturethe moments before the car had ditched into the river and what happened to the occupants thereafter. 
Sometimes inspiration is taken from happenings all around us, like Stained, a story based on a young man that is revising his passport after it has been issued to him. His long stare into the passport triggered the feeling that something must be said about whatever is being looked at in that passporta mysterious stain.
Work is also a very inspiring source, where stories are made in real time. Credit My Identity describes the life of a young female that gets herself entangled in doing the wrong thing for the right reasons.
The longest short story is about a journey to a better life, where family threads are sought, and it climaxes at the Rendezvous: In San Nicolas.
More is discovered than bargained for in Migrated Bloodline." />
