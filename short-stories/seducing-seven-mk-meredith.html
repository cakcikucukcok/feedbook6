  <title>Seducing Seven - Mk Meredith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Romance author Seven Michaels believes in love to her very core. She has to--not only for herself, but for her readers. So when luxury salesman Blake Turner insults not only her books but the people who read them, Seven&#39;s ready to throw down. How dare a playboy like Blake insinuate romance lovers are full of crap? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He wants proof? Fine. She bets Blake she can make him fall for her by using the rules in her latest novel before the end of the convention, or she&#39;ll denounce love in front of all her fellow authors and fans at the Romance Lovers Convention ball. A dangerous game to be sure, but humiliating Blake is worth the risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Seven realizes she&#39;s the one who&#39;s being seduced, she&#39;s no longer sure who is playing whom...or whether she&#39;ll have a career when the bet is over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complete &#39;What Happens in Vegas&#39; series (All standalones which can be read out of order) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tempting Her Best Friend by Gina L.
