  <title>Adwoa - Solomon A. Minta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div class=Section1&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;Adwoa, arrives in a foreign country to learn that she is
regarded by her school mates as a different person. At school the children
laugh at her.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;She comes home one day
and asks her mother why the children call her African.&lt;span
style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;Adwoas&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;concerns are
the problems of mainly every African child. They are often&lt;span
style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;humiliated by their peers. They are made to
believe that they are backward. Because of this ridiculous humiliation, many
African children shun their culture. Some they refuse to eat their native
dishes, wear heir native garb, and even refuse to speak their mother
tongue.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;Adwoa is resilient and is thus
admired for retaining elements of her culture even in the midst of another
dominant culture&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;Ghana, is known to be the friendliest country in the world.
But do we get back the same treatment accorded to us when we travel? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;One of the answers to this question comes from the point of
view of Adwoa as she expresses herself in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;Adwoa echoes the sentiments of other Africans in the
Diaspora. Her voice has become their voices, her concerns are their concerns,
her problems are their problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=MsoNormal&gt;Adwoa should be in the mind of every child and adult
irrespective of race or color. &lt;/p&gt;
