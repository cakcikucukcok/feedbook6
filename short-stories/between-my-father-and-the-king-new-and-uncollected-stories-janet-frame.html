  <title>Between My Father and the King: New and Uncollected Stories - Janet Frame</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;This brand new collection of 28 short stories spans the length of Frame&amp;#8217;s career and contains some of the best she wrote. None of these stories have been published in a collection before, and more than half are published for the first time in &lt;I&gt;Between My Father and the King&lt;/I&gt;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The piece &#39;Gorse is Not People&#39; caused Frame a setback in 1954, when Charles Brasch rejected it for publication in &lt;I&gt;Landfall&lt;/I&gt; and, along with others for one reason or other, deliberately remained unpublished during her lifetime. Previously published pieces have appeared in &lt;I&gt;Harper&#39;s Bazaar, the NZ Listener, &lt;/I&gt; the &lt;I&gt;New Zealand School Journal, Landfall&lt;/I&gt; and &lt;I&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/I&gt; over the years, and one otherwise unpublished piece, &#39;The Gravy Boat&#39;, was read aloud by Frame for a radio broadcast in 1953.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In these stories readers will recognize familiar themes, scenes, characters and locations from Frame&#39;s writing and life, and each offers a fresh fictional transformation that will captivate and absorb.&lt;/div&gt;" />
