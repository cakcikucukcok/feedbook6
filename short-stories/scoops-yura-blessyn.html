&lt;br&gt;
Fiona Styles is a beautiful, educated woman with an excellent job. Her professional life is on point but her personal life is a train wreck. Unfortunately, the men she seeks to have relationships with have their own agenda and she did not get the memo. With the help of her younger sister Penny shes able to learn how to separate the trash from the treasures. An invitation by a suitor convinced her to try the party scene. Thats where she met big, tall, handsome and very distinguished Matt Raven. He knew the right songs to sing and the right steps to dance right into her heart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Weather the Storm&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Technically, slavery has long been over but the foul odor of racism still wafts heavily through the air of Clinton. A kind smile on your face and a lot of gossip behind your back, plenty of Lawd have mercy and Bless his heart, and a clearing of the throat washed down with a glass of sweet tea and ready to move on to the next victim. Working for the Murdocks was the only job Lilly knew. Even though she and the Mrs. often clashed, Mrs. Murdock wouldnt trade Lilly for anyone in the world but youll never hear that from her lips. Lilly was a kind and caring person, but her kindness never brought the right man to her door. Her grandmother knew the right man had already been chosen because it was written in the stars. Hes different nothing like the rest, she just has to receive him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Darling Evil&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
If ever there were someone youd love to hate, KeeKee Shaw would be that person. Egotistical, self-centered, manipulative, arrogant, after meeting her, those would be a few of the words youd use to describe her. You may even say, downright nasty. Although, only a senior in high school, she is wise beyond her years. A pretty Trinidadian-American girl, a fashion queen with very expensive taste but the one characteristic that stands out most is her affinity to temp, lure, and conquer any man she sets her mind to regardless of age, race or relation. All good must come to an end. Unfortunately, in KeeKees case it was a tragic end.&lt;/p&gt;" />
