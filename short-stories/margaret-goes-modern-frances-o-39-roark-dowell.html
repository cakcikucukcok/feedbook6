  <title>Margaret Goes Modern - Frances O&#39;Roark Dowell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the author of Birds in the Air, a touching, big-hearted collection of short stories about women whose lives revolve around family, friends and quilt-making. &amp;ldquo;This collection presents the cozy comfort of characters we quilters easily recognize and relate to, but goes far deeper,&amp;rdquo; writes Marianne Fons. &amp;ldquo;I was moved to tears repeatedly. Dowell&amp;#39;s five short narratives are about the joys and sorrows inherent in the human condition &amp;mdash; but with quilts and quilting pleasantly surrounding them.&amp;rdquo;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Meet Margaret, whose adventures in a new quilting group help her reconnect with her daughter as they grieve the slow loss of a loved one to Alzheimer&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Then there&amp;rsquo;s Liz, a quilter seeking her own tribe in a neighborhood of perfect moms. But maybe she has more in common with her neighbors than she thinks.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Sisters Amanda and Lucy, one dreamy, the other practical as the day is long, have financial woes that may force them to sell their beloved home. Can a quilt made with fabric from a mysterious aunt save the day?&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Lisa is still reckoning with the loss of her best friend. Diving headfirst into a new quilt project, she learns that sometimes a gift can be a first step toward healing.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Melissa Bennett is sensible, smart and skeptical of marriage. A husband sounds nice, but with all the books and quilts in her life, where would she put him?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Frances O&amp;rsquo;Roark Dowell is the critically-acclaimed author of more than twenty &amp;ldquo;beloved books for tweens and teenagers&amp;rdquo; (New York Times Sunday Book Review). In 2016, she founded a small publishing company dedicated to telling the stories of women who quilt.&lt;br /&gt;
