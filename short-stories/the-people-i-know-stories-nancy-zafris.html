  <title>The People I Know: Stories - Nancy Zafris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;The People I Know&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; is a collection of nine stories, told by characters who hover at the edge of life. Whether it&amp;#39;s Lorne, perched on a sofa as a wedding party swirls around him, or the elderly Mrs. R of &amp;amp;quot;Morning at the Beach,&amp;amp;quot; imagining a career in crime as she sits on the front porch of a Miami hotel, these are people oddly accustomed to the sidelines of their worlds.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nancy Zafris&amp;#39;s characters do not so much hurdle their barriers as contemplate them with varying degrees of humor, regret, and fanciful expectation. Gazing out of his window at a horizon of crushed cars, Bonner Junior fantasizes about working at an I.M. Pei office building instead of at John Bonner and Son Metal Shredders; at the same time, his job allows him to amuse his friends with grisly, embellished stories of human shreddings and wild dogs. In &amp;amp;quot;Meeting in Tokyo,&amp;amp;quot; a businessman examines his own attraction and aversion to conformity after taking a young secretary to a &amp;amp;quot;love hotel.&amp;amp;quot; For Wendy, born with a strong nose and a Baltic name, cosmetic surgery has brought acceptance but also boredom. Suffering little &amp;amp;quot;deaths of feeling&amp;amp;quot; with each success, she flirts with disaster, with anything that will make her heartbeat &amp;amp;quot;go up to 75 or more.&amp;amp;quot; Grace, in &amp;amp;quot;Grace&amp;#39;s Reply,&amp;amp;quot; prefers to deal with reality through illusion; she blames her son&amp;#39;s death on a Navy intelligence operation and sends Pampers to an imaginary grandson.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Ranging from the kiddie bleachers of television&amp;#39;s &amp;amp;quot;Uncle Sylvester Show&amp;amp;quot; to the upholstered seats of a Tokyo coffee shop, from a Navy recruitment office to a meeting of Alcoholics Anonymous, these stories enliven the common places of our world. Sad, yet rarely defeated, Nancy Zafris&amp;#39;s characters toe the line and sometimes manage to cross it.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;" />
