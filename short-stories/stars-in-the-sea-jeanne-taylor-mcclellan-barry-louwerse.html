  <title>Stars in the Sea - Jeanne Taylor McClellan, Barry Louwerse</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Never underestimate the impact that your words and actions have on the lives of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the sea star tossed on the beach by an errant wave and now stranded far from an environment that supports it. Perhaps an individual finds that sea star and takes the time to place it back into the sea so it can continue its lifes journey. Neither sea star nor sea star thrower recognizes how that encounter has affected both of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At one time or another, we all are like sea stars, washed up on an unfamiliar beach, totally outside of the comfort we have known, going nowhere, and struggling to survive. Then some forcewhether fate or someones handgives us another chance to grow and live. Something has changed and we are moving forward again. These tales depict both sea stars and those who return them to the sea, offering hope for the future and reminding us of times when we experienced the helping hands of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This collection of short stories celebrates those who find themselves out of their depths and the people who reach out to help them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
