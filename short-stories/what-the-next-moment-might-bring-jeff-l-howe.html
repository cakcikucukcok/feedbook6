  <title>What the Next Moment Might Bring - Jeff L. Howe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the limited perspective of the present, the path weve chosen in life may often seem random or of little consequence. But when we examine our journey from the vantage of hindsight, we find that we have participated in life-changing moments and have been witness to singularly remarkable things. 
This is a collection of moments and stories from the life of one man. Some are humorous, some are poignant, and some are terrifying. Some moments are as brief as the wink of a firefly or the exact instant of death. Others last the time it takes for a rumor to spread or for a penny to fall from a tall building. Still others take millions of years and are still happening. 
Enjoy a climb to the top of a peak in central Idaho, a babys first bowel movement, or a silent drive through the redwoods. Look deeply into the eyes of a diving hawk, a profoundly retarded fifteen-year-old girl, or an aging stripper in Montana. Listen to the sounds of cold Canadian wind slipping under a warm Pennsylvania door. Smell the burning embers of a city on fire. Taste the exhaust of a jet. 
Take a moment." />
