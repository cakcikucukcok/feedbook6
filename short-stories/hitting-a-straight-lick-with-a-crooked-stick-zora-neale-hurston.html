  <title>Hitting a Straight Lick with a Crooked Stick - Zora Neale Hurston</title>

Brought together for the first time in one volume, they include eight of Hurston&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;lost&amp;#8221; Harlem stories, which were found in forgotten periodicals and archives. These stories challenge conceptions of Hurston as an author of rural fiction and include gems that flash with her biting, satiric humor, as well as more serious tales reflective of the cultural currents of Hurston&amp;#8217;s world. All are timeless classics that enrich our understanding and appreciation of this exceptional writer&amp;#8217;s voice and her contributions to America&amp;#8217;s literary traditions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
