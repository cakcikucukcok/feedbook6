  <title>Gargoyles - Bill Gaston</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Here is the best of Bill Gaston&#39;s stories since the publication of his Giller Prize nominated collection, &lt;em&gt;Mount Appetite&lt;/em&gt; (2002). In this extraordinary work, Gaston crafts his fiction around the idea of the gargoyle -- the concrete representation of extremes of human emotions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Gaston&#39;s marvellous, riotous, Rabelaisian world, Gargoyles are physical manifestations of the disfigurements and contortions to which we human beings subject ourselves. Indeed, as Gaston wrote each story, he sketched out a distinct gargoyle to look down over it. For that reason, each story in this collection has a strange and unique guardian spirit whose sometimes benevolent, and sometimes malevolent, presence informs the characters and their actions. Gargoyles shows one of our best writers at the top of his form.&lt;/p&gt;" />
