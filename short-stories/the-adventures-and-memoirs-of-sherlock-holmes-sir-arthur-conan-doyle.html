  <title>The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Adventure and mystery readers alike will love following London&#39;s most famous fictional detective, Sherlock Holmes, in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#39;s short story collection, &quot;The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes.&quot; Created in the late 1800&#39;s, Sherlock Holmes has become one of the most recognized and endearing sleuths in the mystery genre. In &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Red-Headed League,&quot; Holmes must figure out the connection between a group of red-headed men, an Encyclopedia Britannica, and a bank robbery for a confused client. Holmes doesn&#39;t only take bank robberies and small crimes, though. Many hail &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Speckled Band&quot; as the best of the detective&#39;s stories every written; Holmes must solve the murder of a young woman who was locked in a room alone by herself. What is the only clue? The young woman whispered &quot;the speckled band&quot; to her sister right before she died. The collection also includes Doyle&#39;s favorite Holmes tale, &quot;Sherlock Holmes and the Five Orange Pips.&quot; As one of the darker and more popular of Holmes stories, Holmes must solve a string of murders before the culprits strike again. These combined with other classic Holmes tales are the perfect stories for readers of all ages, making &quot;The Adventures and Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes&quot; a perfect addition to any collection." />
