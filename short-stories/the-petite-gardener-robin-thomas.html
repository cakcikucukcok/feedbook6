  <title>The Petite Gardener - Robin Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hamish MacGregor is wealthy, lonely, and longing for a bit of romance.  When fate brings Gianna Grayson to work at his house, he thinks he may have found what he&#39;s looking for.  But The Petite Gardener has a past and secrets of her own.  When her past meets his present, it threatens to destroy everything... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;First grade teacher Isla Hampstead loves &quot;her kids,&quot; but what she really wants is a child of her own.  Helping a woefully neglected student, Isla finds herself in a situation she isn&#39;t prepared to deal with.  Can reaching out to a child be enough for her to find Love at Lincoln Park?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Miranda Scott broke off her engagement and moved away to start over.  She&#39;s convinced it was the right thing to do; Vince isn&#39;t so sure.  Will he let her go?  Is she strong enough to let Weston Frank, a local architect, reveal to her The Design of the Future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;Happy on his small cattle ranch, Rick Watson is a confirmed bachelor and a recluse.  Riley Bremen just doesn&#39;t have the energy to work on another relationship.  But when their paths cross will they be able to ignore the electricity in The Approaching Storm?&lt;/p&gt;" />
