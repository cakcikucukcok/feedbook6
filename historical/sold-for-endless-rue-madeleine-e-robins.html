  <title>Sold for Endless Rue - Madeleine E. Robins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After a blighted childhood, young Laura finds peace and purpose in the home of a midwife and healer. Later, she enrolls in Salerno&#39;s famed medical school--the first in the world to admit women. Laura and her adoptive mother hope that Laura can build a bridge between women&#39;s herbal healing and the new science of medicine developing in thirteenth century Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hardest lessons are those of love; Laura falls hard for a fellow student who abandons her for a wealthy wife. Worse, her mother rejects her as &quot;impure.&quot; Shattered, Laura devotes herself to her work, becoming a respected medico. But her heart is still bitter, and when she sees a chance for revenge, she grabs it--and takes for her own Bieta, the newborn daughter of a woman whose husband regularly raided the physician&#39;s garden for bitter herbs to satisfy his pregnant wife&#39;s cravings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Determined to protect her adored daughter from the ravages of the world, Laura isolates the young woman in a tower. Bieta, as determined as her mother, escapes, and finds adventure--and love--on the streets of Salerno.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bieta&#39;s betrayal of her mother&#39;s love comes at a terrible price as lives are ruined and families are torn apart.  Laura&#39;s medical knowledge cannot heal her broken heart; only a great act of love can bring everyone forgiveness and peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
