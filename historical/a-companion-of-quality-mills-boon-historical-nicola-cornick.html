          &lt;strong&gt;A young woman disappears.&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A husband is suspected of murder. Stirring times for all the neighborhood. When Captain Lewis Brabant returned from the open sea, all thought he meant to choose a bride. As eligible females readied to meet the dashing Captain Brabant, one woman of modest means stood away from the crowd and let her friend have a go at the bachelor.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In fact, Miss Caroline Whiston had no expectations, since she was a lady&#39;s companion. But no sooner had the two met than they felt a heady attraction, despite the odds. Would Captain Lewis defy convention and fall in love with this beguiling companion…?&lt;/p&gt;
