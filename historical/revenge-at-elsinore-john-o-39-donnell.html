  <title>Revenge at Elsinore - John O&#39;Donnell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In 1517, Sweden is on the brink of declaring independence from Denmark, and Martin Luther has posted on a church door in distant Saxony incendiary views that will soon set Europe afire. Sweden&#39;s arch-patriot Hemming Gadh has arranged the coincidence. The Danish king Hamlet is plotting to kidnap and deliver Luther to Rome and the stake in exchange for Vatican support of Denmark&#39;s depredations upon Sweden. Gadh knows that the monk&#39;s heresy is the key to his country&#39;s liberation. Sweden must keep Luther alive and encourage his schismatic diatribe.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;To fulfill that mission, Gadh engages young Magnus Vasabrother of Sweden&#39;s future kingas protector and confidant of the controversial theologian. Disguised as a Norwegian student named Horatio, Magnus enrolls at Wittenberg&#39;s university. There he encounters the Danish king&#39;s dissolute son Prince Hamlet and embarks upon adventures that will determine not only Sweden&#39;s fate but Europe&#39;s future. Meanwhile, Gadh, Horatio&#39;s mentor and Sweden&#39;s master counterspy, has embedded himself at Elsinore as the evil king&#39;s chancellor Polonius. When King Hamlet&#39;s atrocities culminate in the infamous Bloodbath of Stockholm, Gadh and MagnusPolonius and Horatioswear revenge upon the Dane, his bastard son and their kingdom.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Gadh summons Magnus to Elsinore, where Horatio falls in love with Queen Gertrude, recognizes the recently deceased king&#39;s brother Claudius as a great and kind ruler, witnesses Polonius&#39;s death at the prince&#39;s hand, and finallywhen called upon to duel the Black Prince to the deathfinds his path between patriotism and romantic love, obedience and autonomy, vengeance and forgiveness.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Skillfully written, entertainingly intelligent and historically authentic, &lt;B&gt;&lt;i&gt;Revenge At Elsinore&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/B&gt; mesmerizes readers with a vibrant romantic adventure that also provides the key that unlocks mysteries that have puzzled Shakespearean scholars for centuries.&lt;/P&gt;" />
