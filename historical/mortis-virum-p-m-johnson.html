  <title>Mortis Virum - P. M. Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="P. M. Johnsons exciting debut novel chronicles the ill-conceived account of a brilliant but socially awkward history professor innocently conducting research for a paper on a religious-cult-based terror attack occurring almost twenty years earlier and half-way around the globe. Professor Cary Parker OConnor inadvertently stumbles upon a current day plot by a marginal group of extremists known as the MHHB to infect a willing suicidal flock of human mules with an extremely deadly and infectious viral hybrid of Zaire Ebola and a little-known nasty bug named Morgellons. Not only does this fanatical sect possess the biological agent, but they are already on U.S. soil, have the means to release it, and have already alpha tested it. Their plan is to release the infected martyrs on an unsuspecting populace in the continental United States with the help of a notorious individual known only as KAJI. The professor, along with his two colleagues; Vincent, a student of his working on his Masters Degree and Caroline, a companion of chance whose father is brutally assassinated by the terror group due to his misguided interaction with the professor; devise a magnificently deductive plan to have the entire plot exposed and the wannabe terrorists captured before they can successfully release the lethal mixture as planned. But, the three soon discover there to be an unknown alternate contingency portion to the plot which leads to a tense confrontation on a fast moving train bearing a lone wolf possessing the Mortis Virum and headed for a major populated city. In this fast-paced and humorous thrill ride, individuals discover themselves forced to the limits of their intellectual capacity to survive and find themselves changed forever." />
