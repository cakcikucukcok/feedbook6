          &lt;strong&gt;RUMORS WERE FLYING &lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her name was on everyone&#39;s lips. They were agog to find out what Miss Elizabeth Harley had been doing down at the East India Docks. And in such shocking apparel! Why, her uncle&#39;s generosity in giving her a London season had been thrown back in his face.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Elizabeth had not meant to sully her good name. All she&#39;d craved was a chance to travel. Andrew Melhurst had come to her rescue when she needed him most, but should she consider marrying him to save her reputation?&lt;/p&gt;
