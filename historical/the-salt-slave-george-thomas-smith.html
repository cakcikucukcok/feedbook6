  <title>The Salt Slave - George Thomas Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This novel, The Salt Slave, is about a first century family in Jerusalem while under Roman occupation and the struggle of a grandson who feels squeezed between the conflicting religious beliefs of his father and grandfather. He develops a fanatical hatred for the Romans, especially after he saw his parents killed at the hands of the Romans. The issue in the family is centered upon the Messiahship of Jesus of Nazareth. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a boy, Eliab escaped the Roman attack on Jerusalem in 70 AD with the help of some Zealots who fled to the fortress at Masada. When Flavius Silva led Roman legions against the fortress, Eliab was able to escape for the purpose of telling the story of all those who died on the mountain. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a young man, Eliab fought along side of a band of Zealots in a guerilla war against Roman occupiers of the Holy Land until he was captured. Salt Slave is a story of a man finding truth and purpose for life. Through his personal conflict, love, war, imprisonments, beatings, shipwreck, slavery, and then the ultimate deliverance, Eliab finally makes his choice and it is costly, but he finds his answer to his own existence." />
