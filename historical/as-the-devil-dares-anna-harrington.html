  <title>As the Devil Dares - Anna Harrington</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When playing a game of wits, never ever go up against the woman they call the Hellion . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   LOVE IS A BATTLEFIELD... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Whether it&#39;s business or pleasure, Lord Robert Carlisle never backs down from a dare. But finding a husband for scandalous Mariah Winslow? It&#39;s one challenge he instantly regrets accepting. Even with all his connections---and rakish charms---Robert will have to use every trick in the book to marry off a woman with no dowry and no sense of decorum...no matter how stunningly beautiful she is. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Mariah Winslow has no intention of being a pawn in Lord Robert&#39;s game. She knows he agreed to play matchmaker only to secure a partnership in her father&#39;s shipping company, a partnership that&#39;s rightfully hers. For now, though, she&#39;ll dress for the elegant balls he throws and dance with the eligible bachelors he chooses. But she won&#39;t be outwitted by the devil himself -- no matter how tempting and irresistible she finds him. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;With its strong feminist bent and lively battle of wills, Harrington delivers what readers crave: a smart, fun read.&quot; -- RT Book Reviews" />
