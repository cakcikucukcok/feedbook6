  <title>1911 - R.A. Soames</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In her eightieth year, Imogene knows her time is drawing near and finds herself wondering how different her life would have been if events had not occurred in the way that they did. If she had not had to endure horrendous acts of mental, physical, and emotional abuse, would she have aged a different woman? If fate had not stepped in and saved her when it did from that abuse, would she still be here today? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imogene takes a journey through her memories back to the innocent days of Australia in the early twentieth century. She recalls the pleasures of young love that were, for her, only too soon shattered by betrayal of the worst kind. In the face of systematic abuse from her husband, Joseph, Imogene managed to find friendship in the most unlikely of companionsa lifelong friendship strengthened by shared pain and joy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A survivor to the end, Imogene must overcome the demons of love, lust, abuse and betrayal in order to tell the terrible truths of harvest season on her beloved Marigold Farm and perhaps save others from a similar fate. &lt;/p&gt;" />
