  <title>The Birthright  of Mary Magdalene - Joan Riise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who was Mary Magdalene? Before she was the target of the early church fathers, she was a child full of innocence, curiosity, grace, and hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mary you will meet within the pages of Birthright is just seven years old. Seven: the magical age when children begin to unfold, eager to find their place in the world. It is the age at which reason begins to blossom and the flame of understanding is ignited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing from the mystical spark of inspiration that comes from nowhere and everywhere, this story moves back in time through seven generations of women, Marys foremothersback into the age when God was a woman. Gifted with herstory, Mary fearlessly accepts her birthright of creativity, freedom, integrity, and unconditional love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stories are told by her grandmother, Sakinah, around the evenings campfires. Both Sakinah and Marys mother, Hannah, are midwives assisting Mary of Nazareth as she nears the birth of Jesus on the journey to Bethlehem. Following her familys tradition, this is Marys first opportunity to serve as apprentice at a birth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So close your eyes and unlock the gates of your own imagination to travel through an historic time of ancient prophecy and future promise. This is a not a Mary youve known before but one who, like the babe she holds in the first moments of his life, has come to share a searing mission of divine dimension. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Birthright of Mary Magdalene&lt;/i&gt; is a meaningful gift for the tween, teen, or anyone drawn to a spirituality that includes the nourishing balance of the divine feminine. Share this story and your own with the next generation  our culture is created from its stories.

Blue Moon Tarot, MAAT Tarot, and Journey into Egypt Tarot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From start to finish I was captivated by the spirited seven year old Mary. Her journey through seven generations of ancient mother healing wisdom leads her to a future of penetrating accord with her twin flame; a future that will demand her willing sacrifice to preserve the sacred truth at all costs.
