  <title>Allies of the Storm - Alan Lynn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;For most Americans, the Gulf War was half way around the world but brought to us Up, Close and Personal via our televisions and radios. Remember riding that smart bomb right through the window on the evening news.? You probably even know someone who wrote letters to a soldier or sailor during Desert Shield and/or Desert Storm. (My pen-pal was in Kansas City and she still warms a spot in my heart.)&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It was all about oil, right.? Or, was it about protecting the people of Kuwait from the bullies descending out of Iraq.? Or, was it about cleaning out the old rusty weapons from our stockpiles to make room for the new stuff.? Who knows, maybe Sadam didnt sleep well one night and decided to take it out on his neighbor and just happened to do it when President Bush was having a bad hair day. Or, maybe&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Allies of the Storm lets you ride along with John, a Navy pilot, who gets sent to the Persian Gulf to get past the biases of newscasters, theologians and consultants to the war machine. Johns sole purpose is to get to the bottom of things and report his observations directly back to Washington. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;John, the Navys answer to Superman (after all, he can fly), still has to deal with his more down to earth human side. Friends, loyalties, duty, romance, observations and daydreams each let you see a little more into what makes John both a superhero and the boy next door.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;It was about oil, right.? You decide...&lt;/P&gt;" />
