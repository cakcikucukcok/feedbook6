  <title>Extra Innings Trilogy - B.W. Gibson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="About the Book
A dark cloud has settled over the small, rural town of Eugene, Mississippi. Jimmy McGee has fallen into a state of despair, still confused and traumatized by his unexpected encounter with the opposite sex.
Meanwhile, his identical twin brother, Billy, is becoming increasingly obsessed with finding any means of immortalizing his own identity separate from his brother. Frustrated with Billys wild behavior, Jimmy creates a distance between them that ultimately leads to conflict.
Jimmys straight-laced behavior only reinforces Billys belief that Jimmy is and always has been the favored son. This fevered jealousy launches the twins into a vicious tug-of-war that leaves their group of friends without hope of ever seeing the twins, at peace, together again." />
