  <title>The Lieutenant of San Porfirio - Joel D. Hirst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="REVIEWS
a passionate literary experience.
Carlos Alberto Montaner 
Hirst strives to uncover the hidden roots of underdevelopment, amid the legacy of privilege, discrimination, and injustice. He also includes an analysis of why the history of Latin America is one of ongoing frustrations, with every so often the rise of a protector, savior, or leader of the poor, who eventually plunges those people into an abyss deeper and worse then what they had before the onset of these vigilantes.
PanAm Post 
a tragicomic satire about the Chavista revolution, in the tradition of Latin American magical realism; fun at times, but overall worrying and disquieting, particularly as it relates to the future. El Universal
That is why, my new friends the visitor was still speaking. Freddy snapped back to the moment. I would like to make a special request to you from our Comandante, the freely and democratically elected president of Venezuela. He is holding a special socialist youth summit, where la juventud socialista will come from all over the world to learn the lessons of our Revolucin Pacifica. 
Freddys heart skipped a beat. He looked up into the dark brown eyes of his new hero and was sure that the message was for him alone. Please, come. Take a folleto, and if you are interested, follow the instructions to sign up. And with that, the presentation was over. 
The first to jump out of his seat, Freddy accosted the speaker with questions. 
The class started to clear out . Nobody else seemed interested, but Freddy made up for it with his enthusiasm. They talked for a long time about the government, the political organization, and some history. Finally, Freddy asked about the student movement hed seen on TV. They talk specifically about this one girl  
Immediately, a light-skinned young man with dark hair and a thick accent barged angrily into the classroom. How dare you? What do you know about it?" />
