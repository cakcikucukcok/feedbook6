  <title>His Kingdom Come - Margaret Montreuil</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;The Agony of the Cross Loomed for Jesus &lt;/center&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our brother Jesus was on a reckless course 
and I had left Jerusalem because I was angry with love for him. 
I felt helpless to change him and terrified for his life. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;James and his brothers dont know what to do with Jesus. Is their eldest brother the prophesied Messiah, or is he simply out of his mind? Soon enough, events in Jerusalem during Passover bring James and his family to their knees with sorrow: Jesus has been crucified.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the family and followers of Jesus eventually encounter the risen Lord, they joyfully come to believe in him as the promised Messiah. But their own Jewish leaders want to stamp out the heretical believersand the high priest, Caiaphas, takes extreme measures and enlists a young Pharisee named Saul to begin a violent assault against them. In the face of threats, persecution, and death, James, John, Peter, and the rest of the church must rely on raw and untested faith to overcome fearful times and carry out Jesus command to build a kingdom that will change the world in his name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;See Christs final weeks on earth through the eyes of those closest to him. 
Witness the early churchs exciting first daysand then its struggle to remain. 
Take an up-close and intimate journey into first-century Israel in  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
