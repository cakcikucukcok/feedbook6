  <title>Naked in the Wind - Margot Dolgin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is the aftermath of a tragic automobile accident.
Elizabeth and Philip Boucher and their grown son Paul
have plunged over a cliff into the ocean. Their bodies
are never recovered. Ralph Shannon, an invalid and the
family patriarch and Jenny, his twenty-two year old
granddaughter remain desolate in their home on the
California coast. Michael, Jenny&#39;s fianc, is devastated
to have her withdraw from him to cling to her grieving
grandfather. While agonizing over his dead daughter&#39;s
portrait, Ralph decides to commission Gilbert Engress,
a noted artist, to paint Jenny. What ensues is a
passionate love affair. While on the beach Jenny spots a
fisherman dressed as her father, fishing from his
favorite site. Her hysterics causes him to disappear.
Comforting her Gilbert insists it is a cruel coincidence.
While his passions are waning, she is more enamored.
Ralph, who detested his son-in-law, also sees the
fisherman. Who is he? Ralph&#39;s recollections offer the
reader a history of early Carmel, and San Francisco
from the 1906 earthquake through to 1971, which
includes Cal Berkeley. There is a double twist ending." />
