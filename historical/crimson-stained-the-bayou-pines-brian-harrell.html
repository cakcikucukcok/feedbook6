  <title>Crimson Stained the Bayou Pines - Brian Harrell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the early 1900s, socialist Walter Dietz arrives in a remote section of the American gulf coast. Lake Charles, Louisiana, is a small Cajun town, bustling with lumberjacks and wealthy sawmill owners. At the time of Dietzs arrival, the economic affluence of the wealthy is increasing, widening the social gap between the business owners and the men working in the pine woods to the north.&lt;p&gt;
Dietz sees this widening gap as an opportunityan opportunity to become a different kind of missionary. He will not spread the Christian gospels of old in this tiny bayou town; instead, he will spread the political ideals of socialism. As word of his preaching spreads, Dietz finds himself surrounded by curious disciples. Even as his influence expands, he cannot foresee the damage his words will ultimately cause.&lt;p&gt;
A study of socialism and emotional components of the human condition, &lt;i&gt;Crimson Stained the Bayou Pines&lt;/i&gt; presents a historical narrative focused on early
twentieth-century America. Dietzs journey into the Deep South will have catastrophic consequences for the town of Lake Charles,
but are his words to blame? Or are new ideas
always judged with an iron fist, especially
when steadfast intolerance governs the souls
of men?" />
