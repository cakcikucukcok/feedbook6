  <title>Prussian Yarns - Laurie Campbell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Desperate to escape the military, Otto von Goff marries wealthy heiress Hildegard von Puttkamer in a marriage of convenience. Even though they are fond of each other, Hildegard needs Otto to help ensure her familys beautiful Prussian estate of Schnwald stays within her control. True to form, when Hildegards father passes away, Otto inherits the estate as Hildegards husband. But the von Puttkamer family wants Schnwald for their own and will stop at nothing to get it 
Years later, in 1860, Hildegards mother dies, and her will reveals an alarming message: Hildegards distant male cousin, Berthold, is to take charge of Hildegards inheritance instead of Otto, a move that threatens to strip Hildegard and her daughter of their rightful heritage in Schnwald. Not only must Otto contest the will to safeguard his wife and daughter, but also to keep everything he has worked so hard for from being destroyed. Surrounded by enemies at every turn, Otto must gather all his resources to fight for his familys legacy or risk losing it all.
Set in the lush landscape of Prussia in 1860, this historical novel goes deep into the heart of one familys struggle to maintain their heritage in the midst of turmoil." />
