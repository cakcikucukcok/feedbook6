  <title>Mr. Lincoln&#39;s Wars - Adam Braver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this highly ambitious collection, Adam Braver explores Abraham Lincoln&#39;s inner life and personal turmoils -- while also reflecting on the indelible impact Lincoln had on the nation during the last year of his presidency. Braver brings the president to life, not just as the strong and resilient leader of history books but also as a grief-stricken father, heartbroken over the loss of his young son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across a rich canvas of truth and imagination, &lt;em&gt;Mr. Lincoln&#39;s Wars&lt;/em&gt; reveals a president within the White House walls. We see Lincoln as he explores the meaning of loss through a chance encounter with the father of a slain soldier. And a good-hearted young Union soldier is quickly turned into a killer in the name of President Lincoln. Finally, there is the assassination and the autopsy, as seen through the eyes of John Wilkes Booth, Mary Lincoln, the assistant surgeon general, and one of Lincoln&#39;s closest friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brilliant in its depiction of the country during the waning days of the war, this book is an insightful and moving exploration of the myth of celebrity and the passions it arouses. More than anything, &lt;em&gt;Mr. Lincoln&#39;s Wars&lt;/em&gt; introduces a talented new writer whose storytelling ability knows no bounds.&lt;/p&gt;" />
