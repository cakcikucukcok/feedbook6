  <title>The Lost Souls&#39; Reunion - Suzanne Power</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On a lonely hill in rural Ireland, overlooking the gray sea, sits the solid, unforgiving Moriarty home, Solas. After the departure of her grown son, Sive, the Storyteller, is alone in the house for the first time in years. She bathes, dresses in long flowing robes, and sweeps from room to room, calling together the souls of her family&#39;s past. As they all gather around the fire, Sive lays out her tarot cards and prepares to tell their stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the magical landscapes of coastal Ireland to the grotesque bustle of sixties London, Sive gives the history of her grandmother, her mother, and herself. She traces the path of her grandmother&#39;s cruel and unbearable marriage to her mother&#39;s wild escape to London, and, finally, to her own return to the family home. Each woman endures the hardship of being poor and uneducated, and of becoming involved with the wrong men. Their lives are difficult and harsh; and yet, in their own ways, they are able to draw on their inner strength to help each other have a better life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beautifully written with the Irish flare of weaving in a touch of magic, Suzanne Power&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Lost Souls&#39; Reunion&lt;/i&gt; is the story of a mother&#39;s love for her child, a woman&#39;s love for her man, and a family&#39;s love for their land.&lt;/p&gt;" />
