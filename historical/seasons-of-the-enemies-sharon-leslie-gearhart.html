  <title>Seasons of the Enemies - Sharon Leslie Gearhart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Delve into the land of the Dineh, the Navajo, in the turbulent 1860s, in this Season of the Enemies as the Dineh, the People, are attacked and harassed on every sideby the Spaniards of New Mexico, the United States Army, and surrounding tribes.Watch themfight for their very survival, for their homeland, and maintain their way of life under the constant duress of themilitary campaigns led by the famous Kit Carson and others. Experience the burning time and the in-depth and highly researched battles between the Dineh and her enemies. In this Seasons of the Enemies, the author takes us into this extraordinarily descriptivevolume that illuminates the history of the Dineh, the grueling and greedy operations of their Angloenemies, and their despicable and unjust treatment at the hands of the US government. Via Strong Horse Man, the main character, and his clan, we experience the daily lifestyleas well as little known religious rituals of the Dineh. Comparable to the Trail of Tears of the Cherokee experience, Seasons of the Enemies sets itself apart as the must-read anddefinitive treatment ofNavajo history during this period.Once you start this book, you wont wantto put it down; and then youll want more after your read is finished." />
