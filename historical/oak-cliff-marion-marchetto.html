  <title>Oak Cliff - Marion Marchetto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Oak Cliff Farm has been plagued by tragedy, nightmares, and horror for over one hundred and fifty years. The house itself presents its dark history through flashbacks, hidden clues, and ghostly occurrences to Merline Madagascar, who is a house-whisperer of sorts. Unlike other houses with joyful histories that Merline has visited and heard, this house presents a unique challenge when its new owners, Jack and Erica, call Merline to help restore the house to its former elegance. Weary of a recurring nightmare caused by its first owners; the house wants nothing more than to provide shelter to a loving family with children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oak Cliff Farm welcomes Jack and Erica with the hope that they will be the ones to bring happiness to its rooms once again. But a wandering soul still hovers over Oak Cliff Farm, causing unrest and apprehensiveness for all its subsequent owners. Accompanying Merline are her historically-inclined husband Daniel, her intrepid architect/contractor Verne, Chef Jacques and his significant other Erica, and a host of other characters. Will Oak Cliffs past prove too much for Merline? Or will the more than a century-long series of ill-fated events finally come to an end?&lt;/p&gt;" />
