      <meta name="description" content="A MAN OF SIN &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Devastatingly handsome. Vain. Unscrupulous. Valentine Napier, the Duke of Montgomery, is the man London whispers about in boudoirs and back alleys. A notorious rake and blackmailer, Montgomery has returned from exile, intent on seeking revenge on those who have wronged him. But what he finds in his own bedroom may lay waste to all his plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  A WOMAN OF HONOR &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Born a bastard, housekeeper Bridget Crumb is clever, bold, and fiercely loyal. When her aristocratic mother becomes the target of extortion, Bridget joins the Duke of Montgomery&#39;s household to search for the incriminating evidence-and uncovers something far more dangerous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  A SECRET THAT THREATENS TO DESTROY THEM BOTH &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Astonished by the deceptively prim-and surprisingly witty-domestic spy in his chambers, Montgomery is intrigued. And try as she might, Bridget can&#39;t resist the slyly charming duke. Now as the two begin their treacherous game of cat and mouse, they soon realize that they both have secrets-and neither may be as nefarious-or as innocent-as they appear . . ." />
