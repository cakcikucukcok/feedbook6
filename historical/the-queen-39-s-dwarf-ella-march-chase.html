  <title>The Queen&#39;s Dwarf - Ella March Chase</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A richly imagined, gorgeously written historical novel set in the Stuart court featuring a unique hero: Jeffrey Hudson, a dwarf tasked with spying on the beautiful but vulnerable queen &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 1629, and King Charles I and his French queen Henrietta Maria have reigned in England for less than three years. Young dwarf Jeffrey Hudson is swept away from a village shambles and plunged into the Stuart court when his father sells him to the most hated man in England--the Duke of Buckingham. Buckingham trains Jeffrey to be his spy in the household of Charles&#39; seventeen-year-old bride, hoping to gain intelligence that will help him undermine the vivacious queen&#39;s influence with the king.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Desperately homesick in a country that hates her for her nationality and Catholic faith, Henrietta Maria surrounds herself with her &quot;Royal Menagerie of Freaks and Curiosities of Nature&quot;--a &quot;collection&quot; consisting of a giant, two other dwarves, a rope dancer, an acrobat/animal trainer and now Jeffrey, who is dubbed &quot;Lord Minimus.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dropped into this family of misfits, Jeffrey must negotiate a labyrinth of court intrigue and his own increasingly divided loyalties. For not even the plotting of the Duke nor the dangers of a tumultuous kingdom can order the heart of a man. Though he is only eighteen inches tall, Jeffrey Hudson&#39;s love will reach far beyond his grasp--to the queen he has been sent to destroy.&lt;br&gt;Full of vibrant period detail, &lt;i&gt;The Queen&#39;s Dwarf &lt;/i&gt;by Ella March Chase is a thrilling and evocative portrait of an intriguing era.&lt;/p&gt;" />
