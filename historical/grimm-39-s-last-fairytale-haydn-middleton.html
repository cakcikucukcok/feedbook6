  <title>Grimm&#39;s Last Fairytale - Haydn Middleton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In September 1863 Jacob Grimm travels through rural western Germany with his devoted niece, Auguste-- who longs to learn, at last, the truth about her family-- and Kummel, their new and enigmatic manservant. As relations between the three reach the boiling point, Jacob&#39;s traumas and heartbreaks here in his original homeland are revealed in vivid flashbacks. Now, old, Jacob resists Auguste&#39;s attempts to make him take stock of his life, but memories that are repressed have a tendency to reappear in other places and in other guises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout Jacob&#39;s travels, he is reminded of the folk tales he and his brother Wilhelm collected in their &lt;i&gt;Tales for the Young and Old&lt;/i&gt;. Although the brothers were renowned language scholars and passionate supporters of German unification, they were haunted throughout their lives by the &lt;i&gt;Tales&lt;/i&gt;. Most notable is the feverish fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty, which holds a shattered mirror to a life, a country, and a history. The Sleeping Beauty recounted here is neither the Disney version nor even the Grimms&#39; version, but an enchanting tale that goes beyond the marriage of the prince and princess to reveal the surprising truth behind the evil spell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his compelling historical novel, &lt;i&gt;Grimm&#39;s Last Fairytale&lt;/i&gt;, Haydn Middleton re-creates the life story of literature&#39;s most famous brothers. It is a history that could almost be a fairy tale itself, with its fabulous changes of fortune, tests of duty and honor, arrogant princes, lost loves, and twisted family relationships-- all unfolding in a world of dark forests and even darker politics.&lt;/p&gt;" />
