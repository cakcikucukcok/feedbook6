  <title>Sleep in Peace Tonight - James MacManus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s January 1941, and the Blitz is devastating England. Food supplies are low, Tube stations in London have become bomb shelters, and U-boats have hampered any hope of easy victory. Though the United States maintains its isolationist position, Churchill knows that England is finished without the aid of its powerful ally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harry Hopkins, President Roosevelt&#39;s most trusted adviser, is sent to London as his emissary, and there he falls under the spell of Churchill&#39;s commanding rhetoric---and legendary drinking habits. As he experiences life in a country under attack, Hopkins questions the United States&#39; silence in the war. But back home FDR is paranoid about the isolationist lobby, and even Hopkins is having trouble convincing him to support the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Hopkins grapples with his mission and personal loyalties, he also revels in secret clubs with newsman Edward R. Murrow and has an affair with his younger driver. Except Hopkins doesn&#39;t know that his driver is a British intelligence agent. She craves wartime action and will go to any lengths to prove she should be on the front line. This is London under fire, and it&#39;s only when the night descends and the bombs fall that people&#39;s inner darkness comes to light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Sleep in Peace Tonight&lt;/i&gt;, a tale of courage, loyalty, and love, and the sacrifices one will make in the name of each, James MacManus brings to life not only Blitz-era London and the tortuous politics of the White House but also the poignant characters and personalities that shaped the course of world history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
