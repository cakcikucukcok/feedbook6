  <title>The Immigrant Child - Arlene Coleman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this rollercoaster of emotions, of good vs. bad of happy vs. sad you will see-One family, one boy, their lives changed forever by the greed and anger of others. Thomas is only eight years old and hes already seen and faced more than many adults ever will.  Thrust into a new country, a new house-thats not yet his home-his heart stays with the country from which he came. He&#39;s from Zimbabwe, a country ravaged by war and terror. Forced to leave all he loves behind and face a new country, thousands of miles away from his friends and family. Away from his home, he feels alone. Unable to let go of his past, he&#39;s stuck in this new place, taunted by twisted dreams that confuse him, and he has to learn to survive in this country, even if he doesn&#39;t want to be there. Can he leave behind the pain of his past and confront his fears? Can he find a home in this new country, or will he stay stuck in his mind, unable to move forwards, or go back to happier times? And if he finally does find a home in this new place will it all be ripped away from him once again?&lt;/p&gt;" />
