  <title>Ragtime for the Rockies - Karl A. Lamb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;
    This tragic love story unfolds in and around the town of Platteville, Colorado in
    &lt;br/&gt;
    1925 and 1926. In the Roaring Twenties, young women challenge their elders by dancing
    &lt;br/&gt;
    to jazz music, wearing abbreviated clothing, and drinking prohibited alcohol.
    &lt;br/&gt;
    Some men express their opposition in church. Otbers join the Klux Klan,which
    &lt;br/&gt;
    expands into the Northern States, promising violent resistance to social change.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    OWEN MATTISON comes to Platteville High School as athletics coach and science
    &lt;br/&gt;
    teacher, including Vocational Agriculture. Owen&#39;s bride, RUBY, a Home Economics
    &lt;br/&gt;
    graduate, is an accomplished pianist and jazz fan whose clothes and bobbed hair show the
    &lt;br/&gt;
    triumph of flapper fashion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    We meet Owen and Ruby, married for six weeks, sharing a picnic on the LYDELL
    &lt;br/&gt;
    farm overlooking the river. Inspired by natural beauty, Owen sings a favorite hymn, and Ruby harmonizes. Returning to their tiny rented home, Owen
    &lt;br/&gt;
    receives a telephone call from ARTHUR STARK, a School Board member. Stark&#39;s son later
    &lt;br/&gt;
    says Stark dislikes the twentieth century and wants to hold it back. Stark changes a
    &lt;br/&gt;
    meeting date with Owen to attend a luncheon where he joins the Ku Klux Klan, with
    &lt;br/&gt;
    OLIVER SCOTT, the Platteville barber. Both men participate in the next Klan raid on a
    &lt;br/&gt;
    dancehall.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
    Eager to teach moral values, the School Board votes to require readings of the King
    &lt;br/&gt;
    James Bible as part of classroom opening ceremonies. This distresses Catholic parents,
    &lt;br/&gt;
    whose children will be required to hear a proscribed text. FREDERlCK KOBLENZ, owner of
    &lt;br/&gt;
    the Platteville Mercantile store, organizes a protest student walkout. FRANCIS (FRA1\K)
    &lt;br/&gt;
    KOBLENZ, Frederick&#39;s son, leads the walkout from Owen&#39;s classroom. The School Board
    &lt;br/&gt;
    soon writes to all parents, requiring all students to remain for the Bible readings
