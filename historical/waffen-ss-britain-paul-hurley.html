  <title>Waffen SS Britain - Paul Hurley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The novel comprises well researched fact and plausible fiction, carefully interwoven to form an alternative and frightening history. It is a military tale, not just a war story, it is a thriller and love story based on the premise that in 1940 Germany invaded Britain! It is written factually until the point where the allies reach Dunkirk. The cream of the allied armies are then trapped and imprisoned! The Germans invade Britain successfully. In the summer of 1940, Churchill stood virtually alone in his refusal to surrender whilst facing almost certain defeat. In reality, if Britain had surrendered in that summer of 1940 the European war would have ended. Quite possibly no Pearl Harbour and no Italian or further Russian involvement, hostilities would have ceased worldwide. But what of the Holocaust, would that have gone ahead? The evidence suggests that under Hitler and the Nazis it would! The book is thought provoking and fictional. The story is an unambiguous alternative history and the book is anti-Nazi but most certainly not anti-German. CV...
