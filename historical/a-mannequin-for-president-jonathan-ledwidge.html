  <title>A Mannequin for President - Jonathan Ledwidge</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Brutally audacious and satirical, &lt;i&gt;A Mannequin for President&lt;/i&gt; is a fictionalized series of conversations, supported by a fascinating analysis of current and historical events. The result is an extraordinarily lucid portrayal of the Machiavellian intrigues of American politics, and the how&#39;s and why&#39;s of &#39;selecting&#39; a President. &lt;p&gt;
The pundits, including Michael Moore, are wrong. Presidents are tools of the system, not malevolent leaders. The Presidency is a facade behind which the real power resides. Forget elections! Except for minor differences, changing the President is an irrelevance. The American Dream is merely one delusion that reinforces this charade.&lt;p&gt;
American politics today is unchanged from a hundred years ago. Ask the people of the Philippines. At the turn of the 20th Century, they lost tens of thousands, in a futile war of liberation against American colonialism.&lt;p&gt;
They once deceived us with communism. Now terrorism is the new communism, cynically nurtured and exploited on America&#39;s crusade for the world&#39;s oil and natural resources; Manifest Destiny II. Then there is Globalization; a range of policies specifically designed to fail those in need, in order to create The New Jerusalem.&lt;p&gt;
It&#39;s the system, stupid! Not the man in the White House!" />
