  <title>Wealth and Privilege - Jeanette Watts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Money.  Family.  Love.  Hate.  Obsession.  Duty.   Politics.  Religion - or the lack thereof.  Sex -- or, once again, the lack thereof.
Thomas Baldwin finds himself married to a woman he cant stand, while head-over heels in love with another woman he cant have.  Talk about bad planning.  He feels like a kite, buffeted by circumstances which blow him not only through personal crises, but also through some of the most significant events in Pittsburgh during the late 1800s, including the railroad riots of 1877, the creation of the Homestead Steel Works, the assassination of President Garfield, and the Johnstown Flood.  Over time, and with the help of his muse, who dances maddeningly just beyond his reach, he takes control of his life, wresting it from the winds attempting to control him.
A carefully-researched historical novel about life among 
the privileged class of Pittsburgh during the Industrial Revolution." />
