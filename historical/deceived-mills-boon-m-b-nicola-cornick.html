  <title>Deceived (Mills &amp; Boon M&amp;B) - Nicola Cornick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;
          &lt;strong&gt;&quot;Rumor has it a certain notorious Princess has not a feather to fly and is looking for a gentleman to ease her financial worries. Perhaps the Earl of S. is the man she seeks….&quot; – The Gentleman&#39;s Mercury, 1816&lt;/strong&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Princess Isabella never imagined it could come to this. Bad enough she faces imprisonment for debts not her own. Even worse that she must make a hasty marriage of convenience with Marcus, the Earl of Stockhaven–the man she&#39;d loved and lost so long ago. But that he now wants revenge by demanding she be his in more than name only…well, that is simply intolerable!&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the London gossips eagerly gather to watch the fun, Isabella struggles to maintain a polite distance in her marriage. But the more Isabella challenges Marcus&#39;s iron determination, the hotter their passion burns. This time, will it consume them both–or fuel a love greater than they dare dream?&lt;/p&gt;
