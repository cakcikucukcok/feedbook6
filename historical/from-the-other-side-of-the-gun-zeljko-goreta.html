  <title>From the Other Side of the Gun - Zeljko Goreta</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is April 1941. Belgrade has been bombed, leaving its government in shambles. In a small village in the newly independent state of Croatia, its residents know that a war has started, but nobody senses the tragedy that awaits Kornica, especially a young peasant named Antun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not long before Antun is recruited by a new military formation, the Ustashas, where he soon becomes a favorite among the soldiers despite his explosive nature. As the fighting intensifies, Antun joins his fellow soldiers on the battlefields, propelled through time by a series of brutal atrocities that sadly affect his own family and reveal him to be both a hero and a man who recognizes the value of surviving a war in order to feed his family. Will Antun be able to rise above the gunfire and find the freedom he so desperately needs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this historical novel based on true events, a Bosnian-Croatian peasants life is forever changed as World War II begins and he is recruited to fight on the battlefields.&lt;/p&gt;" />
