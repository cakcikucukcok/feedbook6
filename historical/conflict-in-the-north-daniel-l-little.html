  <title>Conflict in the North - Daniel L Little</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1966, and the Cold War is hot! The Prime Minister knows that Canadian Sovereignty is only being given lip service by the worlds two Super Powers, but when a team of Soviet commandos is discovered in Labrador on a mission to disrupt NORADs Pinetree Line communications, he realizes he must act swiftly or risk Canada forever becoming a mere puppet on the world stage.&lt;p&gt;
The President of the United States, also aware of the Soviet incursion and brushing aside Canadas jurisdiction, orders a US Navy SEAL detachment on a clandestine mission to Labrador with the mandate of eradicating the Spetsnaz intruders and returning without being detected by the Canadians.&lt;p&gt;
When the destroyer HMCS Margaree runs afoul of the Soviet and American nuclear submarines responsible for transporting their respective commando units, however, events escalate quickly, driving the world to the brink of nuclear disaster.&lt;p&gt;
With tensions running high, Canadas Prime Minister ignores his advisers and orders a contingent of Canadian Rangers, accompanied by a regular army sergeant, to attack the Soviets. He knows his generals think him foolhardy, but he is also aware that one Ranger in particular could effect the outcome." />
