  <title>When the Plums Are Ripe - Patrice Nganang, Amy B. Reid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The second volume in a magisterial trilogy, the story of Cameroon caught between empires during World War II&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Cameroon, plum season is a highly anticipated time of year. But for the narrator of &lt;i&gt;When the Plums Are Ripe&lt;/i&gt;, the poet Pouka, the season reminds him of the &quot;time when our country had discovered the root not so much of its own violence as that of the world&#39;s own, and, in response, had thrown its sons who at that time were called Senegalese infantrymen into the desert, just as in the evenings the sellers throw all their still-unsold plums into the embers.&quot; In this novel of radiant lyricism, Patrice Nganang recounts the story of Cameroon&#39;s forced entry into World War II, and in the process complicates our own understanding of that globe-spanning conflict. After the fall of France in 1940, Cameroon found itself caught between Vichy and the Free French at a time when growing nationalism advised allegiance to neither regime, and was ultimately dragged into fighting throughout North Africa on behalf of the Allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving from Pouka&#39;s story to the campaigns of the French general Leclerc and the battles of Kufra and Murzuk, Nganang questions the colonial record and recenters African perspectives at the heart of Cameroon&#39;s national history, all the while writing with wit and panache. &lt;i&gt;When the Plums Are Ripe&lt;/i&gt; is a brilliantly crafted, politically charged epic that challenges not only the legacies of colonialism but the intersections of language, authority, and history itself.&lt;/p&gt;" />
