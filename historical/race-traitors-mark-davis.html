  <title>Race Traitors - Mark Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;Race Traitors&lt;/I&gt; portrays the thrilling and compelling exploits of two African American police detectives assigned to Chicago&#39;s Gang Intelligence Unit-two men who witness the apocalyptic suffering of a community and its residents. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
Bound by their oath to protect life and property, these detectives are committed to their pledge to protect and serve. In an attempt to deal with the physical and psychological stress of their job, they battle those who have sworn to destroy their community. Entrenched in the struggle to overcome the gang&#39;s hold on the community, they are forced to become players in the growing reality of human anguish on Chicago&#39;s streets-the urban warfare that pits race, culture, and dedication to duty in a triangle of conflict. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Detective Aristotle Ashford, a veteran detective, shares his hatred of gang violence and his love of the department and the city with his rookie partner, Myles Sivad, creating an exciting and emotional journey of detective drama and suspense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;I&gt;Race Traitors&lt;/i&gt; is a graphic examination of their experiences while combating street gang violence and murder in Chicago&#39;s Woodlawn 
Community during the 1970&#39;s." />
