  <title>Hell or Richmond - Ralph Peters</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner of the American Library Association&#39;s 2014 Boyd Award for Literary Excellence in Military Fiction.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Between May 5 and June 3, 1864, the Union and Confederate armies suffered 88,000 casualties.  Twenty-nine thousand were killed, wounded or captured in the first two days of combat. The savagery shocked a young, divided nation.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop of the birth of modern warfare and the painful rebirth of the United States, &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling novelist Ralph Peters has created a breathtaking narrative that surpasses the drama and intensity of his recent critically acclaimed novel, &lt;i&gt;Cain at Gettysburg&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Hell or Richmond&lt;/i&gt;, thirty days of ceaseless carnage are seen through the eyes of a compelling cast, from the Union&#39;s Harvard-valedictorian &quot;boy general,&quot; Francis Channing Barlow, to the brawling &quot;dirty boots&quot; Rebel colonel, William C. Oates.  From Ulysses S. Grant and Robert E. Lee to a simple laborer destined to win the Medal of Honor, Peters brings to life an enthralling array of leaders and simple soldiers from both North and South, fleshing out history with stunning, knowledgeable realism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the horrific collision of armies in the Wilderness, where neither side wanted to fight, to the shocking slaughter of the grand charge at Cold Harbor, this epic novel delivers a compelling, authentic, and suspenseful portrait of Civil War combat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commemorating the approaching 150th anniversary of this grim encounter between valiant Americans, Ralph Peters brings to bear the lessons of his own military career, his lifelong study of this war and the men who fought it, and his skills as a bestselling, prize-winning novelist to portray horrific battles and sublime heroism as no other author has done.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
