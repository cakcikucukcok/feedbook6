      <meta name="description" content="A Full House is a historical novel of farm life in Alberta, Canada, in the 1930s, 1940s and &#39;50&#39;s. The book follows the historical novels: Book #1 The Gentle Gamblers, and book #2 The Tender Years. The MacIntosh Family moves into their homestead in the northern bushland after trials in a series of rented houses. Here, this pioneer family, along with friends and neighbours, rides out the Depression as one by one their children grow up, and we share their struggles, their joys and their triumphs. This story, the people, the incidents that happened, and the places are true and are taken from the memoirs of the people involved.
