  <title>The Christmas Boutique - Jennifer Chiaverini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling author Jennifer Chiaverini returns with a delightful Christmas-themed installment in her beloved Elm Creek Quilts series&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212;&lt;strong&gt;a captivating, heartwarming tale sure to become a holiday favorite.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just weeks before Christmas, severe wintry weather damages the church hall hosting the Christmas Boutique&amp;#8212;an annual sale of handcrafted gifts and baked goods that supports the county food pantry. Determined to save the fundraiser, Sylvia Bergstrom Compson offers to hold the event at Elm Creek Manor, her ancestral family estate and summertime home to Elm Creek Quilt Camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of the season, Sylvia and the Elm Creek Quilters begin setting up market booths in the ballroom and decking the halls with beautiful hand-made holiday quilts. Each of the quilters chooses a favorite quilt to display, a special creation evoking memories of holidays past and dreams of Christmases yet to come. Sarah, a first-time mother expecting twins, worries if she can handle raising two babies, especially with her husband so often away on business. Cheerful, white-haired Agnes reflects upon a beautiful appliqu&amp;#233; quilt she made as a young bride and the mysterious, long-lost antique quilt that inspired it. Empty nesters and occasional rivals Gwen and Diane contemplate family heirlooms and unfinished projects as they look forward to having their children home again for the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while the Elm Creek Quilters work tirelessly to make sure the Christmas Boutique happens, it may take a holiday miracle or two to make it the smashing success they want it to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praised for her ability to craft &amp;#8220;a wonderful holiday mix of family legacy, reconciliation and shared experiences&amp;#8221; (&lt;em&gt;Tucson Citizen&lt;/em&gt;), Jennifer Chiaverini once again rings in the festive season with this eagerly awaited addition in her beloved series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
