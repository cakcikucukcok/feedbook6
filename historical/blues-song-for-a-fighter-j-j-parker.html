  <title>Blues Song for a Fighter - J. J. Parker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sonny Liston&quot;&quot; -- these words pictured menace and boxing ring beatings in Americans&#39; minds in the 1960s.
Was the &quot;&quot;Big Ugly Bear,&quot;&quot; as a youthful Muhammad Ali called him, as mean and antisocial as he seemed? Or was he a man -- hampered by illiteracy -- misunderstood?
&quot;&quot;Blues Song for a Fighter&quot;&quot; reveals the real Sonny Liston: witty, hopeful, vengeful, loving children and his wife, determined, humorous, yet -- when drunk -- lascivious, crude, and violent.
J.J. Parker, author of the acclaimed &quot;&quot;Tink Wilson,&quot;&quot; has penned a stage play version of Liston&#39;s tempestuous, ill-fated existence ... a vital sunbeam whose starting and ending points no one ever knew. 
Though a former thug paroled from prison ( he did time for armed robbery), Sonny never was paroled from his fate: to uneasily ride a personal Night Train to (and from) nowhere, to be divorced from, yet part of, the human race.
This book offers a three-act play depicting the drama of Sonny Liston&#39;s life, the &quot;&quot;blues song for a fighter&quot;&quot; that he correctly predicted some day would be written, read, and understood.
Settle into your ringside seat ... the bell for Round One is about to clang...." />
