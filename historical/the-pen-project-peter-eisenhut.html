  <title>The Pen Project - Peter Eisenhut</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In the mid-1960s, Peter Troutman was a brilliant computer systems analyst by day and graduate student by night. He was also young and socially naive. He tells the story of his unusual experience in Saigon, the capital of South Vietnam, and the events leading up to his being there in 1967. He tells how his naivety allowed the CIA to involve him in espionage, assassination, and relationships that challenged his sense of morality. This is Peter Troutmans story, as he would tell it. It is inspired by and based upon real events and places, including those of 1960s Saigon.
The Pen Project combines a mystery-solving investigation and romance with the backdrop of a historical setting. The morality questions are insightful and thought provoking. As you consider the possible outcomes, you will not want to stop reading until you know the entire truth." />
