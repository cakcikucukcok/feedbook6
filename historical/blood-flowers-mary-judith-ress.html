  <title>Blood Flowers - Mary Judith Ress</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1969, Sister Meg Carney is fresh out of the Novitiate and sent as a
missionary to Chilejust in time to witness the overthrow of the socialist
government of Salvador Allende. In the aftermath of the brutal military
coup, the priest she works with is murdered and she herself is the target
of surveillance.
Burned out, grieving over the loss of her compaero, Alfredo, and no
longer the young nun who had set out so enthusiastically to bring Gods
word to the Chilean people six years earlier, Meg accepts an invitation
from her Mother Superior to work in El Salvador where she will join Theo,
her best pal from Novitiate days, and her former Novice Mistress Queen
Mum. Smugly feeling she is now a savvy missionary, Meg is soon set
straight by Theo who tells her an entirely different revolution is taking
place in El Salvador. Fed by Biblical refl ection rather than by Marxist
analysis, Meg is soon caught up in events that bring revolutionary forces
to a head.
As Mega woman burdened by her vow of chastitystruggles with her
religious vocation to serve the poor, she somehow manages to fi nd love
and peace in the rawness of life." />
