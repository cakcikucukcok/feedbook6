  <title>The Churchill Plot - David  R Stokes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;As 90-year-old Winston Churchill barely clings to life in January 1965, Great Britain and the world prepare for the most significant funeral of the century. The long-planned grand farewell for the great man (code name: &lt;em&gt;Operation Hope Not&lt;/em&gt;) will include the presence of a &amp;ldquo;who&amp;rsquo;s who&amp;rdquo; list of world leaders, all vying for the attention of the 350 million people who will watch it all via the relatively new Tel-Star satellite technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But one world leader has decided not to go to London for the funeral of Sir Winston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why would the President of the United States, Lyndon B.

And why would the president not send his new vice president, Hubert Humphrey, to the funeral?

America and the world had not yet fully recovered from the assassination of Johnson&amp;rsquo;s presidential predecessor, John F. Kennedy. Yet, in a way that seems to connect back to that awful moment in November 1963, there are rumors of another vast conspiracy, one involving a terrorist attack connected to Churchill&amp;rsquo;s funeral, at the moment more when than 100 world leaders will be gathered together in one confined place.
