  <title>The Operator - Gretchen Berg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;What if you could listen in on any phone conversation in town? With great humor and insight, &lt;em&gt;The Operator&lt;/em&gt; by Gretchen Berg delivers a vivid look inside the heads and hearts of a group of housewives and pokes at the absurdities of 1950s America, a simpler time that was far from simple. Think &lt;em&gt;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#160;in the suburbs with delicious turns of jealousy, infidelity, bigotry, and embezzlement thrown in for good measure. &lt;em&gt;The Operator&lt;/em&gt; is irresistible!&quot;&amp;#160;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8212;Kathryn Stockett, author of the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling novel &lt;em&gt;The Help&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A clever, surprising, and ultimately moving debut novel, set in a small Midwestern town in the early 1950s, about a nosy switchboard operator who overhears gossip involving her own family, and the unraveling that discovery sets into motion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a small town, everyone knows everyone else&amp;#8217;s business . . .&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nobody knows the people of Wooster, Ohio, better than switchboard operator Vivian Dalton, and she&amp;#8217;d be the first to tell you that. She calls it intuition. Her teenage daughter, Charlotte, calls it eavesdropping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivian and the other women who work at Bell on East Liberty Street connect lines and lives. They aren&amp;#8217;t supposed to listen in on conversations, but they do, and they all have opinions on what they hear&amp;#8212;especially Vivian. She knows that Mrs. Butler&amp;#8217;s ungrateful daughter, Maxine, still hasn&amp;#8217;t thanked her mother for the quilt she made, and that Ginny Frazier turned down yet another invitation to go to the A&amp;#38;W with Clyde Walsh. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, one cold December night, Vivian listens in on a call between that snob Betty Miller and someone whose voice she can&amp;#8217;t quite place and hears something shocking. Betty Miller&amp;#8217;s mystery friend has news that, if true, will shatter Vivian&amp;#8217;s tidy life in Wooster, humiliating her and making her the laughingstock of the town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vivian may be mortified, but she isn&amp;#8217;t going to take this lying down. She&amp;#8217;s going to get to the bottom of that rumor&amp;#8212;get into it, get under it, poke around in the corners. Find every last bit. Vivian wants the truth, no matter how painful it may be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Vivian is about to be reminded, in a small town like Wooster, one secret usually leads to another. . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
