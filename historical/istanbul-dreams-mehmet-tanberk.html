  <title>Istanbul Dreams - Mehmet Tanberk</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Against the radiant, magnificent backdrop of Istanbul, an old man reflects on his life as he wishes for a second chance. Taner thinks about his happiness and his achievementsbut he also recalls his failures and disappointments, wondering about what a different destiny might have held for him. Struck by a powerful dream in which he lives out the life he wished he had, Taner must decide whether his dream life is better than the one the Lord destined for him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Istanbul Dreams follows Taner and his family on their journey through all the astonishing changes in Turkey during the twentieth century. Opening against the turmoil, disorder, and poverty of the First and Second World Wars, Taner will grow up in the relative wealth and majesty of post-war Istanbuleven as it eventually converts from a theocratic empire into a secular republic. But as he forges eternal friendships and discovers success in business and in love, a family drama unfolds such that he cant help but wonder how it all could have been different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Between destiny and dreams, discover how a man and a family decide whether or not the lives they have and the lives they share carry all the success, happiness, and love that was meant to be.&lt;/p&gt;" />
