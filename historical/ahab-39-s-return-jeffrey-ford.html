  <title>Ahab&#39;s Return - Jeffrey Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Jeffrey Ford is one of the few writers who uses wonder instead of ink in his pen.&amp;#8221; &amp;#8211; Jonathan Carroll&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bold and intriguing fabulist novel that reimagines two of the most legendary characters in American literature&amp;#8212;Captain Ahab and Ishmael of Herman Melville&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Moby-Dick&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8212;from the critically acclaimed Edgar and World Fantasy award-winning author of &lt;em&gt;The Girl in the Glass&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Shadow Year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of a long journey, Captain Ahab returns to the mainland to confront the true author of the novel &lt;em&gt;Moby-Dick&lt;/em&gt;, his former shipmate, Ishmael. For Ahab was not pulled into the ocean&amp;#8217;s depths by a harpoon line, and the greatly exaggerated rumors of his untimely death have caused him grievous harm&amp;#8212;after hearing about Ahab&amp;#8217;s demise, his wife and child left Nantucket for New York, and now Ahab is on a desperate quest to find them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahab&amp;#8217;s pursuit leads him to &lt;em&gt;The Gorgon&amp;#8217;s Mirror&lt;/em&gt;, the sensationalist tabloid newspaper that employed Ishmael as a copy editor while he wrote the harrowing story of the ill-fated &lt;em&gt;Pequod&lt;/em&gt;. In the penny press&amp;#8217;s office, Ahab meets George Harrow, who makes a deal with the captain: the newspaperman will help Ahab navigate the city in exchange for the exclusive story of his salvation from the mouth of the great white whale. But their investigation&amp;#8212;like Ahab&amp;#8217;s own story&amp;#8212;will take unexpected, dangerous, and ultimately tragic turns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Told with wisdom, suspense, a modicum of dry humor and horror, and a vigorous stretching of the truth, &lt;em&gt;Ahab&amp;#8217;s Return&lt;/em&gt; charts an inventive and intriguing voyage involving one of the most memorable characters in classic literature, and pays homage to one of the greatest novels ever written.&lt;/p&gt;" />
