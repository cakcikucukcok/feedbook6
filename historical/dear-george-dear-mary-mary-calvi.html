  <title>Dear George, Dear Mary - Mary Calvi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A novel about heiress Mary Philipse&#39;s relationship with George Washington, based on historical accounts, letters, and personal journals by&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;b&gt;nine-time New York Emmy Award-winning journalist&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Mary Calvi.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;Love is said to be an involuntary passion, and it is, therefore, contended that it cannot be resisted.&quot; --George Washington&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Did unrequited love spark a flame that ignited a cause that became the American Revolution? Never before has this story about George Washington been told. Crafted from hundreds of letters, witness accounts, and journal entries, &lt;i&gt;Dear George, Dear Mary &lt;/i&gt;explores George&#39;s relationship with his first love, New York heiress Mary Philipse, the richest belle in Colonial America.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From elegant eighteenth-century society to bloody battlefields, the novel creates breathtaking scenes and riveting characters. Dramatic portraits of the two main characters unveil a Washington on the precipice of greatness, using the very words he spoke and wrote, and his ravishing love, whose outward beauty and refinement disguise a complex inner struggle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dear George, Dear Mary&lt;/i&gt; reveals why George Washington had such bitter resentment toward the Brits, established nearly two decades before the American Revolution, and it unveils details of a deception long hidden from the world that led Mary Philipse to be named a traitor, condemned to death and left with nothing. While that may sound like the end, ultimately both Mary and George achieve what they always wanted.&lt;/p&gt;" />
