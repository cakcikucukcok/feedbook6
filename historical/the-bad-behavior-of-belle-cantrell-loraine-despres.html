  <title>The Bad Behavior of Belle Cantrell - Loraine Despres</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Belle Cantrell felt guilty about killing her husband and she hated that. Feeling guilty, that is. A lady shouldn&#39;t do something she&#39;s going to feel guilty about later, was a rule Belle kept firmly in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So begins &lt;em&gt;The Bad Behavior of Belle Cantrell&lt;/em&gt;, a story of murder, adultery, and regular church attendance, which introduces Belle Cantrell as a beautiful young widow with a rebellious streak, years before she will become grandmother to Sissy LeBlanc, the feisty main character of &lt;em&gt;Loraine Despres&lt;/em&gt;&#39;s bestselling &lt;em&gt;The Scandalous Summer of Sissy LeBlanc&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year is 1920, prohibition is in full swing, women are clamoring for the vote, and a narrow-minded intolerance is on the rise. Life isn&#39;t easy for an unmarried woman, not in a little town like Gentry, Louisiana, especially after she&#39;s sent to jail for swimming in an indecent bathing costume with a group of suffragists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s not as if Belle doesn&#39;t know how to behave. She knows the rules. She keeps the Primer of Propriety firmly in mind. But sometimes -- most of the time -- she has to twist the rules a little, or break them, or give them a permanent kink, because they all say the same thing: &quot;Don&#39;t.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a girl has got to live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a year and a half of mourning, Belle decides to get on with her life and kicks off a season of tumult that will change her and Gentry forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sexy, sassy, with laugh-out-loud humor and a cast of zany characters you won&#39;t forget, &lt;em&gt;The Bad Behavior of Belle Cantrell&lt;/em&gt; is a big comic love story and a page-turner. But it delves deeper, as Belle struggles to find her moral center and stand up to forces that are determined to destroy the soul of a town and the people she loves.&lt;/p&gt;" />
