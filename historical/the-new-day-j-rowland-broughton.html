  <title>The New Day - J. Rowland Broughton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is 1912 and Richard Harvey is the heir the Longhalls Estate; the youngest member of a family that has owned and farmed the Estate since it was granted to his ancestors by William the Conqueror. During a journey on horse-back through a severe Winter storm he becomes lost, and finally exhausted he staggers and collapses in the court yard of a small farm. He is found covered in snow and hauled into the farmhouse by Mary Ayres.
So begins a courtship of the two young people, one that sees them married and settled in their large country house which they share with Richards grandfather and a large staff of servants. The estate is run by Richard and Old Mr Harvey until the outbreak of the War with Germany in 1914.
Being a country-man Richard has no desire to become an officer so he enlists as a Private soldier in the Lincolnshire Regiment along with a group of workers from the Longhalls Estate. After a brief period of training they a thrown into the fury of trench warfare where following the slaughter of all of their officers and NCOs the men look to Richard Harvey to see them through.
This is the story of the quiet country gentleman who becomes a national hero, much to his own dismay for he would rather be at home with his wife and family rather than moving on to the next stage of a war that seems to have no ending. He is granted a Field Commission and is rapidly promoted and decorated much to his own regret. Strong in the traditions of his family he is given the Monarchs Special Commission and after being wounded in combat becomes equerry to the King.
Richard Harvey survives the War only to die during the Flu epidemic of 1918 to be survived by his only son
