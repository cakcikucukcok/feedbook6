  <title>Secret Passages - Tommy E. Cauthen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is a fictional story based on historical events occurring during WWII. Two of the primary characters are Norwegian Army captains Hans Lunsford and his friend Carl Romer. The story begins in the summer of 1939 as the clouds of war were drifting across Europe. Events occurring prior to the German invasion of Norway in April 1940 connect them with Adriana Strand, who is an attractive blond Norwegian working as a British spy in the German Embassy in Oslo. After the short war ends with the Norwegian defeat, King Haakon VII and the Norwegian government sail to England and begin to operate in exile. Hans and Carl subsequently hook up with Norwegian resistance groups and escape to the Shetland islands. There they meet up with Adriana, who is involved with the British Special Operations Executive directing operations of Norwegian and British commandos and saboteurs traveling by sea and air into Norway. Their missions were to operate clandestine radios, report German ship movements through the secret water passageway along the West coast of Norway, conduct sabotage operations, and rescue secret agents and British air crew from German or hostile Norwegian operatives. The story depicts all three individuals diverse missions into Norway from 1940 to 1942 when they frequently hide out in various secret hidden passages. The story ends in 1942 with Adrianas midnight mission to Norway. She parachutes into the darkness of the night with two other agents, but trouble ensues leaving Operation Black Shepherd in jeopardy.  The success of the Allies in Northern Europe hangs in the balance." />
