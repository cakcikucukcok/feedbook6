  <title>The Secrets of Midwives - Sally Hepworth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&quot;With empathy and keen insight, Sally Hepworth delivers a page-turning novel about the complex, lovely, and even heartbreaking relationships between mothers and daughters.--Emily Gifin&lt;br&gt;Three generations of women &lt;br&gt;Secrets in the present and from the past&lt;br&gt;A captivating tale of life, loss, and love...Neva Bradley, a third-generation midwife, is determined to keep the details surrounding her own pregnancy--including the identity of the baby&#39;s father-- hidden from her family and co-workers for as long as possible. Her mother, Grace, finds it impossible to let this secret rest. The more Grace prods, the tighter Neva holds to her story, and the more the lifelong differences between private, quiet Neva and open, gregarious Grace strain their relationship. For Floss, Neva&#39;s grandmother and a retired midwife, Neva&#39;s situation thrusts her back sixty years in time to a secret that eerily mirrors her granddaughter&#39;s--one which, if revealed, will have life-changing consequences for them all. As Neva&#39;s pregnancy progresses and speculation makes it harder and harder to conceal the truth, Floss wonders if hiding her own truth is ultimately more harmful than telling it. Will these women reveal their secrets and deal with the inevitable consequences? Or are some secrets best kept hidden?&lt;/p&gt;" />
