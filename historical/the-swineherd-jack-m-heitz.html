      <meta name="description" content="Following the tragic loss of his family, young Will takes to the dangerous roads of thirteenth-century England and beyond as he seeks his fortune and fate.
The call came mid-morning, the day after Christmas. A dark crime had been committed in the lands of Sir Robert. Along with many others, young Will accompanied Robert to the scene, but nothing could have prepared any of them for the horror and carnage that awaited them.
Following the loss of his family, Willa blond-haired, good-natured boy in thirteenth century Englandsets off on his own, hoping to leave the pains of the past behind. On his brave voyage, he makes many friends but also enemies that intend to rob him, kill him, or lead him astray. Will keeps to the path of his destiny.
He soon finds himself forced into the world of brave knights, battles, and mad adventures across the expanses of northern England, Ireland, and the Near East. For the first time in his life, Will must fend for himself and use only his strength and goodness to stay alive. He seeks a bright future following his dark past, but first he must learn how to be a man." />
