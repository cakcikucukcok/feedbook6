  <title>Blind Quest - Bert Tucker Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Much impressed with the scope of your story, kept me entranced, a compelling and intriguing read, ability to mingle past, present and future is a rear trait.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
LTG David Palmer Superintendent West Point &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an era when terrorist actions have become increasingly uncontrollable, seven contemporaries travel back to the days of the early twentieth century carrying twenty-first century knowledge, technology, and experience to influence historical leaders and thus change the course of humanity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blind Quest&lt;/i&gt; is an historical work of science fiction that illustrates how poorly equipped the people of 1905 were to meet emerging global challenges. This expansive adventure not only recounts the state of the world in 1905, but also of the condition of humankind through the twentieth and into the twenty-first centuries. It places historic events and conditions in perspective as the fictional characters interact with that history and make it real to the reader. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traveling with the experience of knowing the future of ten later decades, General Charles Anderson and his six colleagues are brought face-to-face with real historical personalities of the last century. As their paths cross, the story is woven into an exciting adventure traversing the country and encountering the visionary and the tyrants of days gone by.&lt;/p&gt;" />
