  <title>Strange Gods - Annamaria Alfieri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In early 20th century British East Africa, there are rules for the British and different ones for the Africans. Vera McIntosh, the daughter of Scottish missionaries, doesn&#39;t feel she belongs to either group; having grown up in Africa, she is not interested in being the well-bred Scottish woman her mother would like her to be. More than anything she dreams of seeing again the handsome police officer she&#39;s danced with. But more grisly circumstances bring Justin Tolliver to her family&#39;s home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The body of Vera&#39;s uncle, Dr. Josiah Pennyman, is found with a tribesman&#39;s spear in his back. Tolliver, an idealistic Assistant District Superintendent of Police, is assigned to the case. He first focuses on Gichinga Mbura, a Kikuyu medicine man who has been known to hatefully condemn Pennyman because Pennyman&#39;s cures are increasingly preferred over his. But the spear belonged to the Maasai tribe, not Kikuyu, and it&#39;s doubtful Mbura would have used it to kill his enemy. Tolliver&#39;s superior wants him to arrest the medicine man and be done with it, but Tolliver pleads that he have the chance to prove the man&#39;s guilt. With the help of Kwai Libazo, a tribal lieutenant, Tolliver discovers that others had reasons to hate Pennyman as well, and the list of suspects grows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annamaria Alfieri&#39;s&lt;i&gt; Strange Gods &lt;/i&gt;is the first in a new series. Romantic and engaging, this mystery captures the beauty and the danger of the African wild and the complexities of imposing a culture on a foreign land.&lt;/p&gt;" />
