Intelligent, pragmatic, and anxious to escape the shame of spinsterhood, Charlotte chose this life, an inevitable one so socially acceptable that its quietness threatens to overwhelm her. Then she makes the acquaintance of Mr. Travis, a local farmer and tenant of Lady Catherine..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Mr. Travis&amp;#8217; company, Charlotte feels appreciated, heard, and seen. For the first time in her life,&amp;#160;Charlotte begins to understand emotional intimacy and its effect on the heart&amp;#8212;and how breakable that heart can be. With her sensible nature confronted, and her own future about to take a turn, Charlotte must now question the role of love and passion in a woman&amp;#8217;s life, and whether they truly matter for a clergyman&amp;#8217;s wife.&lt;/p&gt;" />
