  <title>Little Falls - Joan Di Clemente</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;BOOK DESCRIPTION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From outward appearances, it seems like the Leo and Margot Lockhart family of Little Falls, New York, is a well-functioning and harmonious family unit. Yet upon closer inspection, each heart in the home harbors its secret of hurt, distrust, and disillusionment.&lt;/p&gt;
Katherine Lockharts innocence and sensitivity as a child are ruled by the iron hand of her Irish mother, Margot. Fear of physical retribution controls Katherines defiance during her teen years, but her intellect resents and mentally argues with the humiliation and responsibilities heaped upon her as the eldest daughter of six siblings. Training for the nursing profession is Katherines salvation, and it is her ticket out of Little Falls, away from her controlling mother and alcoholic father.&lt;/p&gt;
When the moment of truth presents itself, Margot fears exposure as a negligent wife and mother which resulted in Katherines childhood and future years being forever compromised and emotionally altered. Little Falls follows Katherine through the darkest tunnels in life as she rises above the rape, incest, bouts of depression, and physical and emotional abuse to experience the love and joy of family as a respected matriarch in her final years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;***************&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;BOOK REVIEWS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;The gift of learning from others is alive and well in this story.  LITTLE FALLS is not just the name of a city, rather it is a map of survival.  This book comforted through magnificent, expressive, situational life concepts from the falls you take in life to rising above to overcome them.........Denial of one&#39;s current situation is not an option.  After reading this story, I know that I&#39;m on the right path to a happy life.  The power of choice exists in each of us, if we choose to exercise it.&quot; - by NM&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;LITTLE FALLS was engaging from the first page. Its a fascinating window into the early 20th century as seen by different members of a working class familys happiness and heartbreak. It gave me insight to my own grandparents lives. A good read!&quot; - by Deanna H.&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;LITTLE FALLS met all my requirements for a great read. Different and dramatic character traits abound in this absorbing saga. A real life story which kept me happily turning pages.&quot; - by Madalyn W.&lt;/p&gt;" />
