  <title>Viking Spirit - Susan Schaffner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Crisscrossing eight centuries, Alison and Eirik Sigmusson live extraordinary lives. Ties to their pasttheir ancient Viking pastdraw them into dire family situations, but later day realities are just as perilous. Their idyllic days in Mexico turn deceptive as Eirik is unwittingly accused of thievery and murder, but with the magic of a silver bracelet Alison frees him and justice prevails. From one predicament into another, they are summoned back to medieval Sudrland, (Scotland), where Eiriks brother, Sigmus, and his wife, Asta, must defend their beloved estate, Cairnby Manor, and their Icelandic farmstead, Thjorsardal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Present and past collide as Eirik contends with Mexican pearl thieves and Sigmus fights for control of his property. Still, the threads of love and loyalty cannot be broken nor the power of destiny thwarted when Eirik and Sigmus battle to restore their rights to the manor and farmstead. Swords clash. Victories are hard-fought. Losses are many as blood runs red. The final stand for Sigmusson honor, of love lost and found, are part of Viking Spirit: Sagas End.&lt;/p&gt;" />
