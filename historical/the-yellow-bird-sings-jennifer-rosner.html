Hidden in the hayloft day and night, Shira struggles to stay still and quiet, as music pulses through her and the farmyard outside beckons. To soothe her daughter and pass the time, Róza tells her a story about a girl in an enchanted garden:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;The girl is forbidden from making a sound, so the yellow bird sings. He sings whatever the girl composes in her head: high-pitched trills of piccolo; low-throated growls of contrabassoon.

Beautiful and riveting,&lt;i&gt; The Yellow Bird Sings&lt;/i&gt; is a testament to the triumph of hope--a whispered story, a bird&#39;s song--in even the darkest of times.&lt;/p&gt;" />
