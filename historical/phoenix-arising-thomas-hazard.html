  <title>Phoenix Arising - Thomas Hazard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Albert Polzen had entertained hopes of becoming a professional composer for much of his life before answering the call of duty as an officer in the German army.  When he is captured by the Russians and becomes a POW, he turns to his music for solace. With little hope of returning to his new wife, Seldi, he immerses himself in the composition of an operetta to mentally escape his captivity as he could not physically. 
At the same time, military intelligence and political manipulation twist and reshape the progress of the German war effort. Meanwhile, Alberts former lover, Hannilore, uses coded information obtained from her husband to uncover a high-level Nazi official who has become a spy for the Soviets. 
&lt;i&gt;Phoenix Arising&lt;/i&gt; examines the mind of a man who has been thrown into the depths of despair but finds his salvation in the creation of music that will become his legacy. Love, music, and espionage intertwine to tell the gripping story of power plays and personal choices that will decide the fate of all involved." />
