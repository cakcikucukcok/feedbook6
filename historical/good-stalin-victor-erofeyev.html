  <title>Good Stalin - Victor Erofeyev</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The novel Good Stalin is inspired by Erofeev&#39;s experience growing up amidst the Soviet political hierarchy. His father, a staunch Stalinist who has dedicated his life and soul to the party, begins as Stalin&#39;s personal interpreter, and rises rapidly to the top of the political ladder and into the leader&#39;s inner circle. The book reflects the family&#39;s prestigious - and yet precarious - position as members of the nomenklatura. In one memorable scene, the main character Victor recalls how he would walk past the Kremlin as a child and comment to friends, &quot;that&#39;s where my father works - he and Comrade Stalin&quot;. However, unquestioning devotion to the Communist Party does not come to young Viktor so easily as it had for his father: growing up, he begins to write stories classified as &#39;obscene literature&#39; by the party. Like Erofeev himself, Victor gets involved in the world of dissident literature, violating Soviet censorship laws and being expelled from the Writers&#39; Union. His actions result in the end of his father&#39;s career, just at the point when he hoped to be appointed Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. Erofeev&#39;s autobiographical novel provides both a child&#39;s and an adult&#39;s perspective on several decades of Soviet history. The book documents not only the emergence of a prominent writer, but also looks at the evolution of the Soviet dissident movement amongst the nomenklatura." />
