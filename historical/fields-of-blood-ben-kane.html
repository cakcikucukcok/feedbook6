  <title>Fields of Blood - Ben Kane</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Hannibal&#39;s campaign to defeat Rome continues. Having brought his army  safely over the Alps in winter, he now marches south to confront the  enemy. With him is a young soldier, Hanno. Like his general, Hanno burns  to vanquish Rome. Never has the possibility seemed so likely. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facing  Hanno is his former friend, Quintus, whom Hanno met while in Roman  captivity. A bitter quarrel with his father led Quintus to join the  Roman infantry under an assumed name. Among his legionaries, he finds  that his enemies are not just the Carthaginians, but men of his own  side. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stealthy game of cat and mouse is being played, with  Hannibal seeking to fight, and Rome&#39;s generals avoiding battle. But  battle cannot be delayed for much longer. Eventually, the two armies  meet under a fierce summer sun in August in the south of Italy. The  place is Cannae-the fields of blood. The encounter will go down in  history as one of the bloodiest battles ever fought, a battle in which  Hanno and Quintus know they must fight as never before-just to stay  alive.&lt;/p&gt;" />
