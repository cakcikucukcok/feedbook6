  <title>Cameralism in Practice - Marten Seppel, Keith Tribe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book discusses the impact of cameralism on the practices of governance, early modern state-building and economy in seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe. It argues that the cameralist conception of state and economy - a form of &#39;science&#39; of government dedicated to reforming society while promoting economic development, and often associated mainly with Prussia - had significant impact farbeyond Germany and Austria. In fact, its influence spread into Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Portugal, Northern Italy and other parts of Europe. In this volume, an international set of experts discusses administrative practices and policies in relation to population, forestry, proto-industry, trade, mining affairs, education, police regulation, and insurance. The book will appeal to early modernists,economic historians and historians of economic thought.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;  MARTEN SEPPEL is Associate Professor of Early Modern History at the University of Tartu, Estonia. He holds an MPhil from the University of Cambridge.  KEITH TRIBE has a PhD from the University of Cambridge and taught at the University of Keele (UK) from 1976 to 2002, retiring as Reader in Economics. He is now working as a highlyregarded professional translator and independent scholar. Forthcoming work includes a new translation of Max Weber, &lt;I&gt;Economy and Society Part One&lt;/I&gt; (Harvard University Press, 2018). His publications include &lt;I&gt;Strategies of Economic Order&lt;/I&gt; (CUP, 1995/2007); &lt;I&gt;The Economy of the Word. Language, History, and Economics&lt;/I&gt; (OUP, 2015); and (edited with Pat Hudson) &lt;I&gt;The Contradictions of Capital in the Twenty-First Century&lt;/I&gt; (Agenda, 2016).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt; Contributors: ROGER BARTLETT, ALEXANDRE MENDES CUNHA, HANS FRAMBACH, GUILLAUME GARNER, LARS MAGNUSSON, INGRID MARKUSSEN, FRANK OBERHOLZNER, GöRAN RYDÉN, MARTEN SEPPEL, KEITH TRIBE, PAUL WARDE" />
