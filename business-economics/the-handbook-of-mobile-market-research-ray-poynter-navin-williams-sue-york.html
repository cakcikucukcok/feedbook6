  <title>The Handbook of Mobile Market Research - Ray Poynter, Navin Williams, Sue York</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The premier guide to mobile market research&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Handbook of Mobile Market Research&lt;/i&gt; is the first guide to focus exclusively on the use of mobile technology in market research. From a global perspective, more people own mobile phones than landlines or computers, and most people have their mobile phones with them at all times—along with their tablets, smartwatches, media players, and navigation devices. The continuous surge of mobile innovation provides unprecedented access to real-time consumer behaviour. Mobile market research allows users to reach more people, engage more people, and collect more valuable data as respondents are free to engage at their own pace, on their own time.  &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Industry forerunners Ray Poynter, Navin Williams, and Sue York employ decades of study to examine the present and future state of mobile market research, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches. This book contains clear, comprehensive knowledge for those who implement, utilise, and study the field. Readers will learn:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;The characteristics, scope, and importance of mobile market research&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Purposes and effects of principal tools like brand tracking, ad testing, customer satisfaction research, and research technology&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;How mobile devices are used for qualitative and quantitative research by way of online focus groups, online discussions, mobile diaries, mobile ethnographies, and mobile surveys&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Aspects and implications of mobile computer interviews, mobile phone interviews, mixed-mode research, international mobile research, and research using passive data, panels, lists, and communities&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;The significance of the mobile ecosystem, market research ethics, and research on research&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Designed to be accessible and helpful for beginners and advanced users alike, &lt;i&gt;The Handbook of Mobile Market Research&lt;/i&gt; is an extensive guide to one of the most promising, dynamic methods of data collection. &lt;/p&gt;" />
