  <title>365 Days of Motivation - Joe Friend</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Living our daily lives can be as easy as taking in a breath of air or as hard as climbing a mountain&amp;rsquo;s summit.&lt;br /&gt;
There are things that can bring us down and lift us up. Even our own family can fill us up with anger or enlighten us with joy and happiness. Regardless of what stature you have in life, you will always need someone, something, or anything that can help you get through each day. Some people find relief in God, family, companions, dreams and ambitions.&lt;br /&gt;
Living a fruitful life is living it with meaning. Finding that meaning can be a lifelong journey and along the way you may need words of wisdom that will guide you through the right path. Words that will let you overcome the struggles that come along with what life has to offer us.&lt;br /&gt;
Life is always unfair. Some are rich while some seek desperate means just to last throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;#39;re lucky enough to be given the fate of a wonderful life, be thankful for it. If in any case fate has dealt you with a cruel hand, do no falter. Life is a mixed bag. One that&amp;rsquo;s filled with many surprises.&lt;br /&gt;
Today may be rough but tomorrow remains a mystery until you do something today to change what lies ahead. Make each day worth living for the next.&lt;br /&gt;
This e-book will let you in on some of the most inspirational tips that will help you fire up each day of your year!" />
