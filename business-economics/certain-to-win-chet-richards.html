&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Certain to Win&lt;/i&gt; [Sun Tzus prognosis for generals who follow his advice] 
develops the strategy of the late US Air Force Colonel John R. Boyd for the world 
of business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of Robert Corams monumental biography, &lt;i&gt;Boyd, the Fighter Pilot 
Who Changed the Art of War&lt;/i&gt;, rekindled interest in this obscure pilot and documented 
his influence on military matters ranging from his early work on fighter tactics 
to the USMCs maneuver warfare doctrine 
to the planning for Operation Desert Storm.  
Unfortunately Boyds written legacy, consisting of a single paper and a four-set 
cycle of briefings, addresses strategy only in war. [All of Boyds briefings are available 
on &lt;i&gt;
&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://dnipogo.org&quot;&gt;Defense and the National Interest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Boyd and Business&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boyd did study business.  He read everything he could find on the Toyota 
Production System and came to consider it as an implementation of ideas similar 
to his own. He took business into account when he formulated the final version of 
his &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.d-n-i.net/fcs/ppt/boyds_ooda_loop.ppt&quot;&gt;OODA 
loop&lt;/a&gt; and in his last major briefing, &lt;i&gt;Conceptual Spiral&lt;/i&gt;, on science and 
technology. He read and commented on early drafts of this manuscript, but he never 
wrote on how business could operate more profitably by using his ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other writers and business strategists have taken up the challenge, introducing 
Boyds concepts and suggesting applications to business.  Keith Hammonds, in 
the magazine &lt;i&gt;
&lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/59/pilot.html&quot;&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, George Stalk and Tom Hout in &lt;i&gt;Competing Against 
Time&lt;/i&gt;, and Tom Peters most recently in &lt;a target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.tompeters.com/reimagine/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Re-imagine!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have described the 
OODA loop and its effects on competitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They made significant contributions.  Successful businesses, though, dont 
concentrate on affecting competitors but on enticing customers.  You could 
apply Boyd all you wanted to competitors, but unless this somehow caused customers 
to buy your products and services, youve wasted time and money.  If this were 
all there were to Boyd, he would rate at most a sidebar in business strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Business is not War&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the problem has been Boyds focus on war, where affecting 
competitors is the whole idea. Armed conflict was his life for nearly 50 
years, first as a fighter pilot, then as a tactician and an instructor of 
fighter pilots, and after his retirement, as a military philosopher. Coram 
describes (and I know from personal experience) how his quest consumed Boyd 
virtually every waking hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not a monastic existence, though, since John was above everything else 
a competitor and loved to argue over beer and cigars far into the night. During 
most of the 1970s and 80s he worked at the Pentagon, where he could share ideas and debate with 
other strategists and practitioners of the art of war.  The result was the 
remarkable synthesis we know as &lt;i&gt;Patterns of Conflict&lt;/i&gt;.  Discussions about 
generals and campaigns, however, did not give Boyd much insight into competition 
in other areas," />
