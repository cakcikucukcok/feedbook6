  <title>Demand wins - Mauro Artibani</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who are Captains of Capitalism?&lt;br /&gt;
They are the ones that, with what they do, generate wealth for everyone!&lt;br /&gt;
Well, after ten years from the beginning of the economic crisis, who commands?&lt;br /&gt;
Let us see,they are not the producers who with the crisis see their goods devalued, not screditers by credit nor consumers who, without credit remain in standby.&lt;br /&gt;
So, within this chaos, the Consumer Question becomes the only scarce good offered to the market.&lt;br /&gt;
We need an efficient market that is able to do the price of this good.&lt;br /&gt;
When the price is made, the role of Consumers become active sending to the exile those od credit who had protected those of the production .&lt;br /&gt;
Role, that of the ones spending, to scream: &amp;quot;By purchasing, they give value to the goods, with that spending of money they generate wealth; The consumption of those goods provides reproduction, continuity to the production cycle and substance to economic growth. This is how can be substracted space to debt &amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
All this makes the market operators shake, everything moves: the old commanders, first in power, punched the creditors who have ceased protection, while new executives claim space, power, and command for a new government of production processes : The power of demand.&lt;br /&gt;
That power that, managed, makes Enterprise investments profitable, arrange production, jobs, employment and new income. It also goes away from that dreadful time that, mainstream economists, define the &amp;quot;secular stagnation&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
A power that urges producers responsibility to make use of resources, including the quality of intangible and environmentally friendly goods as well as the price of those goods.&lt;br /&gt;
Well, who else, with what he does, can generate wealth for everyone?&lt;br /&gt;
Prosit!&lt;br /&gt;
