It is this process of setting challenging goals and then stretching to achieve them that keeps these organizations successful.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Breakthroughs reflect the health and vitality of a company. Unless a business enterprise continues to challenge itself to do more and to do better in the future, it will be in danger of resting on its laurels and in that way surrendering its market share to other firms which are moving forward. The key to long-term market leadership and sustainable success is to constantly be setting new outrageous objectives and then organizing yourself to achieve them." />
