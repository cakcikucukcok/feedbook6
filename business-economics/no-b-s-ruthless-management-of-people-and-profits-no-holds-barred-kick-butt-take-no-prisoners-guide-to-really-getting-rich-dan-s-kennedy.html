  <title>No B.S. Ruthless Management of People and Profits: No Holds Barred, Kick Butt, Take-No-Prisoners Guide to Really Getting Rich - Dan S. Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;B&gt;What does it &lt;I&gt;really&lt;/I&gt; take to get productivity from people and, by doing so, maximum profits for your business?&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;With a nod to Jeff Bezos, Steve Jobs, Walt Disney, and other ruthless yet highly successful managers, Dan S. Kennedy delivers the answer. In this new edition, Kennedy expands on his proven (if radical) strategies to get accountability, profitability, and productivity from employees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In his traditional &lt;I&gt;No B.S.&lt;/I&gt; style, Kennedy kicks traditional leadership and management ideas squarely in the teeth with a realistic, straightforward assessment of the real relationship between business owners and their employees. Uncompromising strategies help managers gain iron-fisted control and get the results they demand. This take-no-prisoners advice liberates entrepreneurs to act in their best interests and insist on implementation of their objectives. And it leads to a cooperative, high-performance team when traditional textbook methods fail. Topics include learning how to hire profitable employees, taking home as much money as possible, making every employee&amp;#8217;s job a profit center, managing the powerful force of word of mouth, compressing the time between idea and action for maximum profits, and posing questions to individuals that force them to think and improve productivity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
