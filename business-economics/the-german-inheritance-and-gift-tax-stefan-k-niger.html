  <title>The German Inheritance and Gift Tax - Stefan Königer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Germany is the fourth largest economy in the world, making it an attractive business location and boasting a high standard of living. A number of companies have their registered offices in Germany, including many organized as family businesses. In addition, with worldwide mobility and the internationalization of companies, there has been an increase in binational marriages and dual citizenships. These factors often result in German inheritance and gift tax consequences, either through a residence or through assets held in Germany.
By providing deep insights in all issues of tax liability, valuation, tax calculation as well as tax assessment and levy procedures in Germany, this detailed guide is an ideal support for international tax lawyers involved in succession planning for clients who either reside in Germany or hold German assets. The book comprises legal text of the German Inheritance and Gift Tax Act as well as in-depth commentary and guidance, section by section. 
Beginning with an overview of the basic structure of the German Inheritance and Gift Tax Act, chapters in the book address each section of Act and the author’s informed commentary includes practical advice and instructions regarding tax planning.  Topics addressed in the German Inheritance and Gift Tax Act include these issues, among many others:
Taxable transactions
Personal tax liability
Community property
Gifts inter vivos
Valuation
Tax exemptions
Privileged assets
Real estate
Tax rates
Taxation of pensions, uses, and services
