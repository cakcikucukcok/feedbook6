  <title>FIRE - Dan Ward</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Noted military technology expert Dan Ward&amp;#39;s manifesto for creating great products and projects using the methods of rapid innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do some programs deliver their product under cost, while others bust their budget? Why do some deliver ahead of schedule, while others experience endless delays? Which products work better&amp;#8212;the quick and thrifty or the slow and expensive? Which situation leads to superior equipment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With nearly two decades as an engineering officer in the U. S. Air Force, Dan Ward explored these questions during tours of duty at military research laboratories, the Air Force Institute of Technology, an intelligence agency, the Pentagon and Afghanistan. The pattern he noticed revealed that the most successful project leaders in both the public and private sectors delivered top-shelf products with a skeleton crew, a shoestring budget, and a cannonball schedule. Excessive investment of time, money, or complexity actually reduced innovation. He concluded the secret to innovation is to be fast, inexpensive, simple, and small.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FIRE&lt;/em&gt; presents an entertaining and practical framework for pursuing rapid, frugal innovation. A story-filled blend of pop culture and engineering insight, &lt;em&gt;FIRE&lt;/em&gt; has something for everyone: strategic concepts leaders can use as they cast a vision, actionable principles for managers as they make business decisions, and practical tools for workers as they design, build, assess and test new products.&lt;/p&gt;" />
