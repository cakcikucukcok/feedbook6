  <title>Investing in the Right Property Now! - Margaret Lomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Investing in today&#39;s property market is different from investing pre-GFC. Old strategies are simply not working. So property expert Margaret Lomas set about comprehensively re-considering the economy, property and the future for the Australian market. Slowly but surely she started to uncover ideas and information which no other property expert had really ever disseminated. She challenged all the accepted theories and started smashing the myths that investors had accepted for so long. &#39;We are more than a decade into the 21st century and it&#39;s high time we began to act and think like we live in this century, rather than the last!&#39; says Margaret. Investors today need to understand the dynamics of how macro and micro economies operate and how they affect the property markets. Margaret explains this theory in her trademark easy-to-understand style. The book also includes information on:* The current property landscape* Matching property with investors&#39; profiles* Timing the markets to invest when an area is about to take off* Finding strong cash flow and capital growth investments* Recognising growth drivers to find the next hot spot before it becomes one! All vitally important to help readers to start Investing in the Right Property Now!" />
