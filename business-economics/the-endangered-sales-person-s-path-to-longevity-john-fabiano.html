  <title>The Endangered Sales Person’S Path to Longevity - John Fabiano</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What a piece of work is a salesperson, to work with people who many times defy reason, when having to master infinite skills and labors, including to think, act, speak, dance, and overall, perform well while endeavoring to present a form and image delightful, pleasing, and acceptable to the potential customer? Yes, an angel, a god, a conundrum (John Fabiano).
With concern for the future of the salesperson who is at risk of disappearing from core business processes due to the explosion of technology and changing attitudes, John Fabiano presents a consideration for success and longevity, different from traditional sales doctrine, emphasizing a return to sales basics and fundamentals as a starting point for the individual salesperson to retune his or her efforts and methods.
Fabiano speaks from experience and research of contemporary findings that clearly indicate sales today is losing not only value but also necessity. He believes there are ways for the salesperson to come off of the endangered list, but such will require working smart and building on a foundation that works simply and ethically and is distinctively owned by each individual.
Sales is not a battle, a war, or an athletic competition . . . Such assume that the customer is the enemy, the opposition, and is to be defeated, implying that the salesperson is the winner and the customer is the loser. That doesnt make sense when the object of the exercise is to provide the best and most reasonable solution to satisfy the customers needs. Sales is a simple process with altruistic overtones and shading and needs not be complicated when reasonable and ethical people collaborate to enact responsible and mutually effective business agreements.
Praise for The Endangered Sales Persons Path to Longevity
