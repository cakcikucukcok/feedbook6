Most of these positions are part time and do not draw the best of salaries. Unfortunately, there is little training and no certification requirements for these positions. In many cases, newly elected officers or elected/appointed officials depend on the past practices of their predecessors. These past practices may be OK or not OK and may not meet todays standards. The budgets are much bigger and there are more state and federal laws/regulations to comply with.
