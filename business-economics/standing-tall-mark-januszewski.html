  <title>Standing Tall - Mark Januszewski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s face it, the hope fades a few weeks after we finish the book and very little, if anything, really changes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So what kind of book is this? It will challenge you but with challenge comes change. As Tom &amp;quot;Big Al&amp;quot; Schreiter, [3 million books sold], declared, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;How to build character? Mark J shows us how in this story of personal development. Warning. Working through this book takes effort, but the result will last a lifetime. A great book.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Discovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A chance meeting in 1994 led Mark to a discovery. The discovery? That an easy to make and easy to keep promise daily would lead to a skill making change effortless.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Little did Mark know that chance meeting and keeping a promise daily would also lead to the 13 Riches of Life, move him from bankrupt to beach front and doing what he loves daily. The promise is really is easy to keep and it&amp;#39;s easy not to keep. That&amp;#39;s the challenge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At the core of the discovery was a very simple idea. We must grow in character before we can acquire authentic wealth that last and perpetuates. At that meeting Mark was handed a hand-written version the Ancient Verities and The Map to the 13 Riches of Life. He was told the Map to Riches was of no value if he did not master the Verities, grow his character and stand tall in the seven basic truths that yield wealth effortless.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;The Work&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mark had read lots of &amp;quot;those self-help books&amp;quot; and found, while some offered a good thoughts or ideas, there was no daily plan. Everybody knows a vision without a plan is a fairytale. What really sets this book apart in addition to the Seven Basic Truths the truly wealthy know is a specific, daily plan in the form of a 98-page workbook. The workbook, available in all additions, guides you with a very short checklist so anyone can master the Verities and then effortlessly navigate The Map, also included, to the 13 Riches in Life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Let&amp;#39;s Make It Easy For Everyone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A survey was conducted to discern what would be the best way to make the book and workbook available. Some people wanted the workbook included in the book so the charting of their progress and the material were together. Others felt it should be separate because they did not want to write in a book. And, a third group, those who enjoy ebooks, would have the daily plan [it appears in all versions], but no way to do the writing required to acquire the 13 Riches.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Instead of trying to find the best choice, Mark decided to make it easy for everyone. If you write in books, grab the paperback version. If you don&amp;#39;t like writing in books or really enjoy ebooks, just head over to markjbooks.com and you can download the workbook instantly.&lt;/p&gt;" />
