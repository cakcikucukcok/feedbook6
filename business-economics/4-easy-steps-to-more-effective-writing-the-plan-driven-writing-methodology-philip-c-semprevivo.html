  <title>4 Easy Steps to More Effective Writing: The Plan Driven Writing Methodology - Philip C. Semprevivo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="4 Easy Steps to More Effective Writing is a book that is targeted to the needs of Business Professionals.   As such, it should also be considered as excellent supplemental reading for the college or graduating high school student. The book introduces the author&#39;s easy-to-use four step methodology for developing and executing a Writing Plan. The underlying premise of that methodology is that the key to more effective writing is to develop such a Writing Plan prior to actually attempting to write.  The methodology which is called Plan Driven Writing (PDW) was used to write this book.  Further, extensive examples and illustrations are included in the book to illustrate exactly how the methodology was employed in writing the book.   Therefore, the book serves as an excellent case study on how PDW can be used to develop and write from a plan.  Additionally, a series of four Chapter End Problem-Sets guide the reader through each of the four steps of the PDW process for a writing project that the reader selects.  The objective of the approach used in writing the book is to equip the reader with the skill level needed to freely use the PDW methodology on future projects subsequent to reading the book." />
