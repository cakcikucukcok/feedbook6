About Author&lt;br /&gt;
Liam Birkett is changing the way many people and firms do business. No matter the size of the firm or the budget, his refreshing enthusiasm, insight and expertise create business ideas and turns them into reality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Liam began in office management before moving into sales and marketing. He was involved in the launch of Mace and VG group in Ireland. His experience extends into wholesale, retail, cash and carry, and consultancy on a national and international basis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He worked for advertising agency O&amp;rsquo;Kennedy Brindley Advertising (which became Saatchi &amp;amp; Saatchi) before co-founding design and marketing consultancy Bernardini, Birkett &amp;amp; Gardner Ltd. For more than 20 years, his firm was responsible for corporate identities and marketing initiatives for blue-chip companies and SMEs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His unique skill is to see matters from a design, marketing and sales perspective. Coupled with his comprehensive understanding of intellectual property, Liam can generate a unique way of looking at existing or new business opportunities.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many people have good ideas, products or services but do not have the ability to commercialise them. In the absence of a worthwhile promotional fund, they cannot obtain essential media exposure. Liam can show them how to do it. Being the creator of brands and an inventor himself, he has &amp;lsquo;been there, done that&amp;rsquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Liam is sought out as a pundit on intellectual property matters and has been repeatedly asked to speak to university classes, business groups and professional bodies, both national and international.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He is a consultant expert to the European Commission Framework Programme and past president of the Society of Designers in Ireland.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
