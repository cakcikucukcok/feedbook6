  <title>Irrational Persistence - Dave Zilko</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;A modern-day Detroit success story that fuels the entrepreneurial fire&lt;/b&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Irrational Persistence&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of Garden Fresh Gourmet, and how two entrepreneurs turned a million-dollar debt to a 100-million-dollar annual revenue. Woody Allen famously said that 80 percent of success is just showing up; but any entrepreneur can tell you that it&#39;s the other 20 percent that&#39;s key. The founders of Garden Fresh took that old saying to heart, building so many strategic advantages into their products and business that their &#39;sales&#39; team didn&#39;t have to do any selling—they simply had to show up. In this book, you&#39;ll find out what kind of legwork goes into building a mega-success product, and the strategies, methods, and just plain stubbornness that helped two guys from Detroit build a market leader. &lt;p&gt;Garden Fresh Gourmet is now the number-one fresh salsa in the US, shipping over a million units every week to Costco, Walmart, Whole Foods, and other national chains—and it all began with two middle-aged guys with negative funds and plenty of ideas. This book shares their journey, insight, and passion to help you build a better business and take it to the top. &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Learn how two entrepreneurs went from major debt to major revenue&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Discover the key characteristics of a product that sells itself&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Consider why selling out might not be the ultimate goal&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Track a journey of &#39;irrational persistence&#39; from rags to riches&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Garden Fresh Gourmet is an inspiration beyond the journey—the way you run things at the top matters, too. &lt;i&gt;Irrational Persistence&lt;/i&gt; shows you how to make the tough decisions, live with the sacrifices, and prioritize your values as you build your brand and just keep on going." />
