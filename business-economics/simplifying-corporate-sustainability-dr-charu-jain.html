  <title>SIMPLIFYING CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY - Dr Charu Jain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Corporations are slowly realizing the impact of their business on the environment and society. They are also facing increasing pressure from their stakeholders to follow responsible business practices. Many companies are looking to incorporate and manage a sustainable business. However, they are unaware on where and how to start this transition. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book explains the basics on how to incorporate sustainability into any business. It gives the simple understanding of the concept of sustainability, and the basic approaches to identify, implement and measure sustainability in any business. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through the various examples given in this book of various industries, readers can identify which aspect of sustainability to adopt in their business, and the various steps that can be taken for its implementation and management. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book aims to simplify and explain corporate sustainability to professionals, students and businessmen from all industries! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What Others Say: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book by Dr. Charu Jain, Simplifying Corporate Sustainability: A Guide to Implementing Sustainable Practices, comes as a lifeline and breath of fresh air for anyone who would like to have a 360â? degree view on sustainability in a lucid manner. In this publication, she brings to the fore her understanding of the subject and her experience therein, combining her educational pursuits and her practical work for many years. The book beautifully blends in the theoretical aspects and various elements of sustainability, along with the metrics and best practices, to implement and improve on the same. The inclusion of case studies and realâ?life examples helps the reader to better relate to SIMPLIFYING CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY and understand the core of the subject. Its relevance to successful businesses is what distinguishes it from other publications, which tend to delve solely on the philosophical and environmental aspect, which incidentally also stands covered herein. My compliments to Dr. Charu Jain for capturing the above in this publication, and I hope it can motivate many organizations and individuals to weave in sustainability into every aspect of their lives.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Happy reading!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dilip Raghavan Chief Editorâ?Publisher Colour Publications, India&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr Charu Jain has attempted through this handbook to remind the readers about the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) that nations have to aspire for and achieve before 2020. Sustainability strategy is to be carved out to manage and measure it to enable environmental footâ?print measurements. I am sure that the global industry system shall make this as a handy toolâ?box for human resource development through this simplified guidance document for sustainability practices to corporate responsibility for ensuring sustainability on our planet. Wishing all best reading experience,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dr TP Rajendran Former ICARâ?Asst DG (Plant Protection) &amp;amp; ICAROfficer on Special Duty (NIBSM) Visiting Fellow Research &lt;br&gt;Information System for Developing Countries&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;quot;Sustainability&amp;quot; &amp;amp; &amp;quot;CSR&amp;quot;, once clichÃ© words as &amp;quot;nice to have&amp;quot; on the company agenda, have moved today to the &amp;quot;must have&amp;quot; essential focus of the industry.
