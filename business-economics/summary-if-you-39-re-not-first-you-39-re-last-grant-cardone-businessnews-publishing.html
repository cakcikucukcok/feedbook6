  <title>Summary: If You&#39;re Not First, You&#39;re Last - Grant Cardone - BusinessNews Publishing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “IF YOU&#39;RE NOT FIRST, YOU&#39;RE LAST: Sales Strategies to Dominate Your Market and Beat Your Competition” by Grant Cardone.&lt;br&gt;Almost all the benefits in business go to whoever is first in your market. It’s obvious, therefore, that you could be consistently and aggressively moving towards that target. You will need, Grant Cardone suggests, to be active, when others just talk: your every business decision should be made with the goal of pre-eminence in mind.&lt;br&gt;Even in tough economic times, Cardone believes it’s possible to flourish: “The good news is twofold: (1) there are exact and precise actions that you can take to counter any contraction and (2) contractions are excellent opportunities in which to expand and conquer market share.” If You’re Not First, You’re Last explains how to get on track, with specific advice. How should you find your power base, and how is it possible to re-energize old customers? What are the best ways to convert unsold customers, and create a referral system? What are the best ways to add value to your product, and exceed customer expectations?&lt;br&gt;There are five building blocks in the advance and conquer system; Grant Cardone demonstrates how effective they are and how easy they can be implemented. &lt;br&gt;" />
