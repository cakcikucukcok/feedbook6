  <title>How to Ask for What You Want and Get It! - Lucille Orr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Even if you&amp;#39;ve never thought of being wealthy, successful or CEO of the company you work for, by the time you&amp;#39;ve finished reading this book you&amp;#39;ll be planning your first corporate take-over. This book oozes positivity. Lucille Orr pumps the motivational muscle like Arnold Schwarzenegger pumps iron. It is a foot-to-the-floor pep talk of developing a can-do, go-for-it, don&amp;#39;t-take-no-for-an-answer attitude to life, business and the universe. This book makes me nervous. She&amp;#39;s convinced me that I can do anything that I want! I&amp;#39;ve now got no more excuses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book is written primarily for women but, hey, a lot of guys could do with this grab-the-bull-by-the-horns philosophy as well. For a full-on, terminal assault on your doubts, fears, low self-esteem and underachiever attitudes, grab yourself a copy of this book and get yourself a new head space. Start thinking rich, feeling rich, smelling rich. After you&amp;#39;ve read this, you&amp;#39;ll know you can do it. Get pumped up for success. No more excuses! - The Adelaide Ray - Newspaper" />
