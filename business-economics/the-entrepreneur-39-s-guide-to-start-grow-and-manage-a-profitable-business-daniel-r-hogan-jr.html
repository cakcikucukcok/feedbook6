      <meta name="description" content="$$$ The Entrepreneurs Guide
To Start, Grow, and Manage a Profitable Business
In his book The Right Stuff, Tom Wolfe describes what it took for the early test pilots to succeed:	
	A career in flying was like climbing one of those ancient Babylonian pyramids 	made up of a dizzy progression of steps and ledges; and the idea was to prove at 	every foot of the way that you were one of the elected and anointed ones 	who 	had the right stuff and could move higher and higher and even-ultimately, 	God 	willing, one day-that you might be able to join that special few at the very 	top, 	that elite who had the capacity to bring tears to mens eyes, the very 	brotherhood of the right stuff itself.
Although  success as an entrepreneur launching a new business does not include feeling superior or facing death, it does require that a person have a special set of qualities and skills with which to exercise good judgment, make wise decision, take calculated risk, and get along with and lead others.  
The $$$ The Entrepreneurs Guide To Start, Grow, and Manage a Profitable Business provides what it takes, what is the right stuff for the successful entrepreneur.  
The most successful entrepreneurs are not necessarily those who work hardest or longest.  Successful business owners are those who have a vision that can see beyond the bottom line, who have learned to manage their professional and personal lives.  Making it with a new business venture requires all the traits of an entrepreneur as enumerated in  $$$ The Entrepreneurs Guide, as well as the knowledge, skills, and persistence to grow and withstand the stress, ambiguity, conflicting objectives, emotions, and chaos that comes with a new business effort.  
Achieving this balance is what $$$ The Entrepreneurs Guide is about.  It will help you steer a path to guide you with the right stuff to the top of the pyramid of business success." />
