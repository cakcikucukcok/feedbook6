What this book does tell the reader is about some of the &quot;ins and outs&quot; of Wall Street;  about how things really work in the banking world; about some of the speed bumps to watch out for and some of the &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; that is ripe for the picking, from getting in the door and developing positive habits, to getting a bonus and handling retirement. In order to really succeed, it is necessary to know as much as possible about how Wall Street really works. &lt;i&gt;Working the Street&lt;/i&gt; goes a long way in providing exactly that.&lt;/p&gt;" />
