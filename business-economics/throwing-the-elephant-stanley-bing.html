  <title>Throwing the Elephant - Stanley Bing</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stanley Bing follows his enormously successful &lt;em&gt;What Would Machiavelli Do?&lt;/em&gt; with another subversively humorous exploration of how work would be different&amp;#8212;if the Buddha were your personal consultant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What would the Buddha do&amp;#8212;if he had to deal with a rampaging elephant of a boss every day? That is the premise of Stanley Bing&amp;#8217;s wickedly funny guide to finding inner peace in the face of relentlessly obnoxious, huge, and sometimes smelly bosses. Taking the concept of managing up to a new cosmic plateau, Bing urges no less than a revolution of the spirit in the American workplace, turning overwrought, oppressed, stressed-out employees into models of Zen-like powers of concentration, able to take their elephant-like bosses and grey, lumbering companies and twirl them around the little finger of their consciousness. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Bing&amp;#8217;s unique tradition of social criticism cum business self-help, &lt;em&gt;Throwing the Elephant&lt;/em&gt; presents Four Truths (or possibly Five), a Ninefold Path, and one useful, hilarious guide to workplace sanity, success, and enlightenment that surpasses all understanding, survival.&lt;/p&gt;" />
