  <title>You Can&#39;t Know It All - Wanda T. Wallace</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#8217;s organizations are packed full of experts in every area from marketing to risk&amp;#160;to sales to IT. Many of these people are also leaders, heading teams or large departments. They are followed because they know more than the rest of their group. They are followed because of their credibility as experts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The toughest transition in business comes when expert leaders are asked to move beyond their expertise and lead a less homogenous group. Suddenly, experts face a new set of problems. They struggle to gain basic competence in dozens of areas without having to become the expert in every aspect. In Wanda Wallace&amp;#8217;s experience, this move&amp;#8212;from expert leader to a broader kind of authority&amp;#8212;requires a new mindset about how to lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wallace explains what few people understand&amp;#8212;how to add value as a leader when you&amp;#8217;re dealing with an ever growing set of responsibilities over which you have little detailed knowledge. The work you do and the way you interact with people must also change. Managing now requires a light touch and a different approach to delegation. Above all, managing is about recognizing that while you may not do all the work of your team, you must enable the team to do the work. In this world, trust becomes essential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;You Can&amp;#8217;t Know It All,&lt;/em&gt; Wallace presents the coaching model she has developed to address the challenges of this transition. She offers strategies for individuals to navigate their new roles and learn to combine their expertise with their leadership responsibilities. She gives essential advice on the fundamental change in mind-set that this requires. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This invaluable handbook offers novice and experienced managers alike insights into their own careers, explains why their star performers may suddenly be floundering, and provides essential tools for guiding development.&lt;/p&gt;" />
