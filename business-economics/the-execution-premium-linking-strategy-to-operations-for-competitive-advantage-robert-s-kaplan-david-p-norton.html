  <title>The Execution Premium: Linking Strategy to Operations for Competitive Advantage - Robert S. Kaplan, David P. Norton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;In a world of stiffening competition, business strategy is more crucial than ever. Yet most organizations struggle in this area--not with formulating strategy but with executing it, or putting their strategy into action. Owing to execution failures, companies realize just a fraction of the financial performance promised in their strategic plans. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It doesn&#39;t have to be that way, maintain Robert Kaplan and David Norton in &lt;EM&gt;The Execution Premium&lt;/EM&gt;. Building on their breakthrough works on strategy-focused organizations, the authors describe a multistage system that enables you to gain measurable benefits from your carefully formulated business strategy. This book shows you how to:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Develop an effective strategy&lt;/STRONG&gt;--with tools such as SWOT analysis, vision formulation, and strategic change agendas&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Plan execution of the strategy&lt;/STRONG&gt;--through portfolios of strategic initiatives linked to strategy maps and Balanced Scorecards&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Put your strategy into action&lt;/STRONG&gt;--by integrating operational tools such as process dashboards, rolling forecasts, and activity-based costing&lt;BR&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Test and update your strategy&lt;/STRONG&gt;--using carefully designed management meetings to review operational and strategic data &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Drawing on extensive research and detailed case studies from a broad array of industries, &lt;EM&gt;The Execution Premium&lt;/EM&gt; presents a systematic and proven framework for achieving the financial results promised by your strategy. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
