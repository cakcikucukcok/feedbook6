  <title>The Intelligent Entrepreneur - Jr. Bill Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Written with the cooperation of Harvard Business School, an instructive and inspiring book for anyone who dreams of starting a highly profitable business&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1998, three Harvard Business School graduates--two men and one woman--turned down six-figure salaries at big corporations, bet on themselves, and launched their own new companies. By their ten-year reunion, their audacity had paid huge dividends. They&#39;d made many millions of dollars, created hundreds of jobs--and left their mark on the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on dozens of interviews with highly successful entrepreneurs, Harvard Business School professors, and HBS alumni, &lt;i&gt;The Intelligent Entrepreneur&lt;/i&gt; tells the compelling and instructive story of how these three young founders developed ideas, assembled teams, built ventures, and achieved their dreams. Along the way, they learned that starting great companies requires much more than a ferocious work ethic or good timing. Their hard-won insights--distilled into ten key rules--will help anyone become a successful entrepreneur. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What they teach you at Harvard Business School is that intelligent entrepreneurship can be learned. In that spirit, Bill Murphy Jr. uses a unique combination of vivid storytelling and lucid instruction to show would-be entrepreneurs how to improve their odds of creating dynamic, lasting businesses.&lt;/p&gt;" />
