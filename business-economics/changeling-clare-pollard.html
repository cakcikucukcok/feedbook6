  <title>Changeling - Clare Pollard</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Poetry Book Society Recommendation. Clare Pollard&#39;s fourth collection is steeped in folktale and ballads, and looks at the stories we tell about ourselves. From the Pendle witch-trials in 17th-century Lancashire to the gangs of modern-day east London, Changeling takes on our myths and monsters. These are poems of place that journey from Zennor to Whitby, Broadstairs to Brick Lane. Whether relocating the traditional ballad &#39;The Twa Corbies&#39; to war-torn Iraq, introducing us to the bearded lady Miss Lupin, or giving us a glimpse of the &#39;beast of Bolton&#39;, Changeling is a book about our relationship with the Other: fear and trust, force and freedom. &#39;Her work really is emphatically of our time, capturing the world in its beauties and horrors in writing that&#39;s technically superb, but which also has what, if I was a sentimental chap, I&#39;d call heart&#39; ?Ian McMillan, The Verb. &#39;The themes are ancient ?guilt, grief, the almost unbearable com-mingling of beauty and suffering ?but shown through contemporary globalised life in all its grossness and gloryPollard&#39;s wit, honesty and recklessness&#39; ?Frances Leviston, Yorkshire Post. &#39;Clare Pollard has so much youthful talent that it&#39;s alarming. The poems are raw and sexy, exotic and compelling, their insights at once intimate and universal. There&#39;s a cruel precision of observation too, coupled with a real opulence, about these pieces I loved the headlong rush of it all&#39; ?Catherine Czerkawska, Mslexia. &#39;Pollard&#39;s poems are like shards of glass, brittle, dangerous things that work their way under your skinPollard is a poet of the 21st century, a witness of the present and a shaper of its voice&#39; ?John Sears, PopMatters.Poetry Book Society Recommendation.
