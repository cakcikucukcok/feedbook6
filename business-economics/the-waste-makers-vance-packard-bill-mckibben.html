  <title>The Waste Makers - Vance Packard, Bill McKibben</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An expos&amp;#233; of &quot;the systematic attempt of business to make us wasteful, debt-ridden, permanently discontented individuals,&quot; &lt;I&gt;The Waste Makers &lt;/I&gt;is Vance Packard&#39;s pioneering 1960 work on how the rapid growth of disposable consumer goods was degrading the environmental, financial, and spiritual character of American society.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;I&gt;The Waste Makers &lt;/I&gt;was the first book to probe the increasing commercialization of American life&amp;#8212;the development of consumption for consumption&#39;s sake. Packard outlines the ways manufacturers and advertisers persuade consumers to buy things they don&#39;t need and didn&#39;t know they wanted, including the two-of-a-kind of everything syndrome&amp;#8212;&quot;two refrigerators in every home&quot;&amp;#8212;and appeals to purchase something because it is more expensive, or because it is painted in a new color. The book also brought attention to the concept of planned obsolescence, in which a &quot;death date&quot; is built into products so that they wear out quickly and need to be replaced. By manipulating the public into mindless consumerism, Packard believed that business was making us &quot;more wasteful, imprudent, and carefree in our consuming habits,&quot; which was using up our natural resources at an alarming rate.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;A prescient book that predicted the rise of American consumer culture, this all new edition of &lt;I&gt;The Waste Makers &lt;/I&gt;features an introduction by best-selling author Bill McKibben.&lt;/P&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;Vance Packard &lt;/B&gt;(1914-1996) was an American journalist, social critic, and best-selling author.
