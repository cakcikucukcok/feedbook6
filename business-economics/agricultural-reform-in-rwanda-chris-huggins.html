  <title>Agricultural Reform in Rwanda - Chris Huggins</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;International observers have lauded Rwanda as an
example of an African country taking control of its own development trajectory,
and as a market-friendly destination for investment. A key component of this narrative has been an ambitious programme of agricultural reform, involving private
firms, NGOs, and international charities. The Rwandan government claims these
reforms have been a resounding success, tripling crop yields and helping to combat
hunger.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Chris Huggins argues, however, that Rwanda’s liberal,
modernising image sits poorly with the regime’s continuing authoritarian
tendencies. Featuring in-depth case studies of the effects of agricultural
reform in three different regions, and drawing on hundreds of interviews,
Huggins shows that the much-vaunted ‘liberalization’ of agriculture has in fact
depended on the coercion of Rwandan farmers, and in many cases has had a
detrimental impact on their livelihoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Kagame regime now coming under
increasing international scrutiny, this work provides a timely look at the
impact of ‘market friendly authoritarianism’ in contemporary Africa, making
essential reading for students and scholars of development in the fields of
sociology, anthropology, political science, and economics.&lt;/p&gt;" />
