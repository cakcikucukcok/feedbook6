  <title>The Fall of Advertising and the Rise of PR - Al Ries, Laura Ries</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bestselling authors and world-renowned marketing strategists Al and Laura Ries usher in the new era of public relations. &lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s major brands are born with publicity, not advertising. A closer look at the history of the most successful modern brands shows this to be true. In fact, an astonishing number of brands, including Palm, Starbucks, the Body Shop, Wal-Mart, Red Bull and Zara have been built with virtually no advertising. &lt;p&gt;Using in-depth case histories of successful PR campaigns coupled with those of unsuccessful advertising campaigns, &lt;em&gt;The Fall of Advertising&lt;/em&gt; provides valuable ideas for marketers -- all the while demonstrating why &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;advertising lacks credibility, the crucial ingredient in brand building, and how only PR can supply that credibility; &lt;li&gt;the big bang approach advocated by advertising people should be abandoned in favor of a slow build-up by PR; &lt;li&gt;advertising should only be used to maintain brands once they have been established through publicity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bold and accessible, &lt;em&gt;The Fall of Advertising&lt;/em&gt; is bound to turn the world of marketing upside down.&lt;/p&gt;" />
