  <title>Romance Your Finance - Kenneth Ricardo Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is intended to be utilized as if it were a coach
guiding you through the maze of personal financial
literacy options available. The romantic parallelism is
intended as an extra point of reference. It is ironic that
these are two elements of life, romance and finance,
that virtually everyone will deal with at some point. Not
only do they not have traditional means of practical
education, they are almost taboo to talk about even in
polite conversation. Too many of us learn about these
two important elements of life in a haply, catch as one
can type of way. Everyone has had some form of a love life
or dreams of having one. Everyone desires to be at least
financially stable if not rich. The hope of this book is to
illustrate a relationship between love life and financial life
so that the reader can be even more inspired to improve
their financial literacy, and perhaps spice up their love
life too. It is often misquoted in the Bible when people
say money is the root of all evil. It actually states the
love of money. We emphasize the difference between the
love of money and the use of money as a tool. We dont discount the importance of money in our everyday lives,
therefore, the need for proper management of it, but we
want everyone to understand the importance of other
qualities in life such as character development, morality,
and of course love. In other words, as important as money
is, it is not everything. Money is a great tool, but a poor
master. This book looks to change mindsets. We want to
think that money is not the root of all evil . . . but living
in poverty is evil when you can do better." />
