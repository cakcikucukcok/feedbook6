  <title>Anomalies - Christopher Allen Guidry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;At the turn of the century, strangely gifted humans encounter unbelievable experiencesand a scientist begins building an army of cybernetic organisms as the foundation of his planned empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world exactly like ours, a species of extraordinary humans exists. They are called Anomalies; they evolved from Gods and possess amazing gifts. For countless millennia, Anomalies and Gods have lived peacefully alongside humans. But as the twentieth century arrives, all of that is about to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the turn of the century, some Anomalies have grown tired of hiding in the shadows; in response, the government, armed with knowledge of the other species, creates organizations to deal with terroristic threats the Anomalies pose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several decades later, Russian scientist Dimitri Gustav, building on Hitlers ideas, begins a campaign of world domination through science and technology. By the beginning of the twenty-first century, he has created numerous cybernetic organisms and genetically engineered creatures. He begins to form his own army, intent on building an empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, as a series of events begins to unravel, new enemies arise, threatening the anonymity and balance of society the government has accomplishedand possibly preparing to cause a revelation and expose a secret that has been so desperately hidden.&lt;/p&gt;" />
