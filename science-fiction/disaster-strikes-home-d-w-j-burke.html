  <title>Disaster Strikes Home - D. W. J. Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Following an earthquake that destroys the White House and kills the entire executive branch of government, a news reporter claims, America is under attack. David Leone is a brilliant chemist in Washington, DC. He is the worlds youngest Nobel Prize winner, an honor he won for his work with molecular bonds; he lives a quiet life with his experiments until this so-called attack. Now, he is forced to leave his home as DC tries to recover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Martial law is declared. General Hugh Freeman of the United States Joint Council is appointed national leader. David is prepared to wait out the Washington evacuations, but he is soon approached by men who need his help. Apparently, the earthquake was no natural disaster. Creatures from the center of the earth have come to claim what they believe is theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of Davids knowledge, the government needs him to stop this unforeseen threat. Once a scientist, David is given a gun and expected to become a hero. But the creatures from below are clever. The military cant stop them, so it is up to David to find a way to save mankind, the Earth, and his own faith in the power of science.&lt;/p&gt;" />
