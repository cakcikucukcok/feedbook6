  <title>The Silent History - Eli Horowitz, Matthew Derby, Kevin Moffett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A generation of children forced to live without words. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It begins as a statistical oddity: a spike in children born with acute speech delays. Physically normal in every way, these children never speak and do not respond to speech; they don&#39;t learn to read, don&#39;t learn to write. As the number of cases grows to an epidemic level, theories spread. Maybe it&#39;s related to a popular antidepressant; maybe it&#39;s environmental. Or maybe these children have special skills all their own. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Silent History&lt;/i&gt; unfolds in a series of brief testimonials from parents, teachers, friends, doctors, cult leaders, profiteers, and impostors (everyone except, of course, the children themselves), documenting the growth of the so-called silent community into an elusive, enigmatic force in itself--alluring to some, threatening to others. Both a bold storytelling experiment and a propulsive reading experience, Eli Horowitz,  Matthew Derby, and Kevin Moffett&#39;s &lt;i&gt;The Silent History &lt;/i&gt;is at once thrilling, timely, and timeless.&lt;/p&gt;" />
