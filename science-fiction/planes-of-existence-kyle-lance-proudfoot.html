  <title>Planes of Existence - Kyle Lance Proudfoot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="? Planes Of Existence is a Science Fiction/Fantasy Novel with a good dosage of Humor and Horror which I, Kyle Lance Proudfoot, have written. It combines the best elements of both science fiction and fantasy and is hyper modern and futuristic taking place on far distant planets in the Universe. Leading from The Black Dungeon Doorway which is published by AuthorHouse UK it expands upon Character Classes introduced in The Free Show giving life to their profiles. There is great adventure, plenty of magic and technological devices and absolutely phenomenal battles. There is also a strong portrayal of the theme of Light and Shadow. I maintain my highly descriptive and exciting style of writing.
? Planes Of Existence is Part 2, the sequel of The Black Dungeon Doorway. This will give me time to promote and try to make a bestseller of The Black Dungeon Doorway which is already published by AuthorHouse UK. There is also a Free Draft Promo of it.
? My plan is to write a trilogy; the third title is The Door Of Light or Door Of Light and is a progression towards the Light and Good which is standard in all stories and most Hollywood plot lines." />
