  <title>Cold Fusion - Dr. Bob Fenn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cold fusion offers eternal power from water, but this search for destroyed many careers. Despite this, the dream remains as seductive as ever. Many research teams continue still to chase the dream. 
Tom, a new research student at Cambridge, begins his quest aided by Freyja, an autistic Icelandic quantum mechanics savant. Henry, the laboratory cat, likes Tom but is inseparable from Freyja. Discrete Intelligence surveillance is maintained over their research to retain its value to the U.K. Over time the pairs relationship shift from co-operative work arrangements to a far closer personal relationship. During this time a far-eastern government actively tries to acquire their work to exploit it for their own ends. 
A laboratory accident shows the two the way to create cold fusion by producing slow neutron cascades. Trying to recreate those conditions involves Tom working away from the Cavendish laboratory and, one evening, he is kidnapped whilst cycling home. Held captive, he is interrogated about his work, but manages to escape and work his way back home. 
A second attempt some time later kills the two foreign agents involved leaving Tom in a coma and Freyja missing, apparently drowned. Months later, in York, Tom notices a nun carrying a collection tin and believes that he has seen Freyja again and a search begins to locate her. Freyjas identity is un-equivocally confirmed by Henrys reaction the unknown nun." />
