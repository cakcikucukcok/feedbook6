  <title>Dracula and Frankenstein: Two Horror Books in One Monster Volume - Bram Stoker, Mary Shelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Victor Frankenstein is consumed by his desire to discover the secrets of life. After several years of research, Victor feverishly constructs a man out of old body parts and brings him to life. Victor is immediately horrified by his ambitious creation, and flees his apartment in remorse. The newborn monster disappears from Frankenstein&#39;s laboratory and enters the world as an outcast, struggling with his own identity. What follows is a gripping tale of murder, injustice, and revenge. When Count Dracula departs Transylvania on a Russian ship, crew members begin to mysteriously disappear. After the ship docks, and more people are attacked, rumours of a monster quickly spread. When Abraham Van Helsing is asked to intervene, Dracula meets his match. On his quest to find Dracula, Van Helsing is forced to hunt newly made vampires, using a cross, garlic, and a wooden steak as weapons. But tracking down Dracula will prove to be harder, and more dangerous that Van Helsing could have ever imagined." />
