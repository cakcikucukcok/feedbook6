  <title>Danger from the other side, and five other science fiction stories. - Haines Nichole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I must maintain control, I must remember why I&amp;rsquo;m here, Alexis, that&amp;rsquo;s right, I was looking for Alexis and to heal the wounds in me that were Chris, &amp;lsquo;5,4,3,2 and 1 deep, deep, deep hypnosis. You&amp;rsquo;re listening to my voice and soon you&amp;rsquo;ll find that even if you want to be able to be alert and awake, you just won&amp;rsquo;t be able to, you&amp;rsquo;ve given your power to me, just let go now, just relax, that&amp;rsquo;s right, that&amp;rsquo;s right, deep, deep, deep hypnosis, very good now, very good&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the cinema screen or the screen of my mind, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure, I saw the strange man in the silver cape again. He was wearing a veil, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t make out his face and as I began to distinguish the trance from my location I realized that it was his voice who&amp;rsquo;d influenced my mind on the flight of stairs. I noticed again that the room was filled with outsiders, all seated with me on the floor, for there were no chairs to relax in. The man&amp;rsquo;s voice seemed to dominate us all and I could feel terror rising through my being.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow, subliminally, the man in the silver cape, quite possibly Chris or Lucifer, commanded a man and a woman in the audience to stand and pour liquid onto each of our heads, like we were being anointed, attuned, or ritually initiated into a Satanic - like cult. I screamed, finally finding my voice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;No, I&amp;rsquo;m with God, I&amp;rsquo;m a Christian&amp;rdquo; and I ran from the room, desperately searching for other alternatives. Next to the cinema screen, I found a small side door, pushed my way through it and was about to run but I found myself in an area with a very large swimming pool.&lt;/p&gt;" />
