      <meta name="description" content="&#39;A TRUE SCIENCE FICTION MASTERPIECE!*****&#39;  Just when you thought that everything was as you knew it.   The Universe being as infinite as it may be, that we are all alone in it. An expanse so deep, that we may never reach its end and with it come so many questions that are yet unanswered.  What would you do if you had all of time and space at your fingertips? Would you unearth the origin of the light? Or Would you confront the assassins of the stars?  65 million years ago at the time of the Dinosaurs, a humanoid Reptilian race ruled planet Earth. Before the impact of the devastating asteroid that wiped out all life on the planet, the Reptilians were rescued from Earth by a race of advanced Extraterrestrials called the Pleiadians. After the apocalypse, a new lease of life took form. It is now the year 2001 and the Reptilians are coming home. The Battle for Earth begins.  Parental Advisory: contains strong language and depictions of violence." />
