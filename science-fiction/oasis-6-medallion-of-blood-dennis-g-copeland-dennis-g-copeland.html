  <title>Oasis 6: Medallion of Blood - Dennis G. Copeland, Dennis G. Copeland</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It had been over twenty years since Earth ended the bloody Separatist Wars and united the outer planets and far outposts.  It was now a time of growing prosperity, expanding to the far reaches of the galaxy.  Earth had built six giant stations at the outer edges of the solar system in every direction  know as the Oasis jump points.  Each will provide a peaceful haven in preparation for the long trips out into the galaxy, or back.
After the theft of an ancient device from a remote research facility, a small group of secret and powerful individuals race to recover the device before it falls into hands beyond their control.  Nothing or anyone will stop them from succeeding.
Assigned to the Oasis 6 jump station, Captain Ryan Moss was tired and contemplating retiring.  Circumstances were about to postpone that idea after receiving a cryptic message and the Medallion.  Ryan now finds he holds the key to unimaginable power in his hands with unseen forces willing to risk everything to get it back.
Pressed by company director Frank Brackett for one last trip, one that would be highly profitable to both of them, someone from the shadows has other ideas about how Ryan should retire  one more permanent.  As his mission begins, Ryan suddenly finds he is helpless to escape the path of murder and intrigue before him.  His only chance, find out who is trying to destroy him before they succeed, and why?" />
