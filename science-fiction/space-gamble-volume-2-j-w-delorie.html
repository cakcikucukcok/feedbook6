  <title>SPACE GAMBLE: VOLUME 2 - J.W. Delorie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Operator Furgis stood with his hands behind his back staring at the big blue giant planet. However his thoughts travelled elsewhere with concern. He knew after five years of debate from the Earth Tribune, the Solar Council wanted Acela Vega in their custody and they sent their best to accomplish their goals. Marshall Scoop would arrive soon for an arrest warrant with his senior pit boss&amp;rsquo;s name, and he knew he would not turn her over, even if it meant independence for his orbiting wagering station. His concern also grew with Dr. Gerlitz&amp;rsquo;s secret weapons research as this caused a lot of unnecessary debate about the legitimacy of his entertainment facility. He also felt excitement as his thoughts turned to the newly announced worm hole discovery past the Kuiper belt, and knowing the new science vessel would stop at Neptune One before exploring the new territory. His thoughts were interrupted by the vid com chime, he already knew it was his future wife, and he also knew she would be asking about Darkstar&amp;rsquo;s next Mech match, he smiled to himself knowing if Taby won, she would be in the championship match. He turned to the vid com and accepted the link.&lt;/p&gt;" />
