  <title>Unfolding, as It Should - Keith Canedo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="According to Filipino island folklore, every life has two stages of destinyhardships endured as a caterpillar that ultimately guides ones flight as a butterfly.
Teesa Paruparos family needed rescuing.
Her father Mannys journey began in a cold and rundown orphanage in Carigara at the turn of the century. Its hardships only served to shape his dreams of a better life, but at what cost?
Marita, her mother, lived the life of an island princess in the picturesque fishing village of De La Cruz. Her peaceful, carefree days were shattered when her village was savagely attacked during World War II, resulting in the heartbreaking murder of her father, mother, and brother and in years of struggling to survive as one of thousands of war-refugee children.
Manny and Maritas caterpillar hardships unfortunately affected their childrenTeesa and her four older brothers, Thomas, Pete, Auggie, and Sam. Struggling to discover their own paths in 1960s Los Angeles amid their family dysfunction and abuse brought them to the brink of disintegration. But generations of adversity were infused with a strong common thread of hope. And from hope came understanding and finally forgiveness not only of their parents but also of themselves.
Teesa Paruparos family needed rescuing, and it would come from a surprising and unexpected source." />
