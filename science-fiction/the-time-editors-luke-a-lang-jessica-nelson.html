  <title>The Time Editors - Luke A Lang, Jessica Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The history of planet Solaya was one riddled with war and chaos. With the help of key figures within each nation, the Solayans&amp;nbsp;realized they had to put this tension aside and learn from one another. In doing so, they unleashed amazing scientific discoveries.&amp;nbsp;While science flourished, no discovery matched the one that changed&amp;nbsp;the course of their planet&amp;rsquo;s history forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the creation of a governing body known as The Assembly, the Solayan&amp;nbsp;race uncovered the ability to shift objects, and eventually living beings, into a neighboring universe bordering their own. They began to record and document everything in this new universe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, The Assembly learned&amp;nbsp;something terrifying which threatened&amp;nbsp;the very world they had worked so hard to build. Their sun would&amp;nbsp;explode within the next two hundred years. Although this seemed&amp;nbsp;far into the future, they realized they must start now to move their entire species to another inhabitable planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Assembly set&amp;nbsp;forth to design the perfect team for such a daunting task. LaDon Grafter, and his team of scientists, must use this new technology to find an inhabitable planet outside their own universe. Inside this neighboring universe, they find a small, blue planet. After recording and mapping out the history of Earth, from beginning to end, they learn the history of this &amp;ldquo;human&amp;rdquo; race is strangely similar to their own, although Earth&amp;rsquo;s history does not end up smelling like a bed of roses. Through recording devices known as Solespheres, LaDon&amp;#39;s team watch as the human race destroys each other as well as the planet as a result. The Assembly, along with the brain power of LaDon&amp;#39;s well-crafted team, devises a plan to edit Earth&amp;#39;s time line&amp;nbsp;and mold it&amp;#39;s history after Solaya&amp;rsquo;s. This makes it easier to introduce such a profound technology to the people of Earth while saving them from their own demise. At the same time, this gives the Solayan&amp;nbsp;race a temporary solution until they can find a more suitable planet to call home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
