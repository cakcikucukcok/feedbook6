  <title>The Omega Chronicles Volume 3 - Mack W. Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="You would think it strange for a teenage boy to get a doll in the mail from his parents. But its even stranger when this doll comes to life, saying that she was made for him by his scientist parents before they disappeared in a lab accident. At the same time, a man comes after him and the android in hopes of using it to reshape humans into armored warriors. Terry is about to find out the android has the power to change into armor and enhance any human she bonds with, turning them into the fastest and possibly the most powerful being alive, able to move at speeds faster than the speed of light. 
Now Terry and this android must use their power to not only find his parents but also save the universe from the ones that want to use the androids power for the wrong reasons. Luckily, they dont have to do this on their own. They have good friends and new allies to aid them in their fight to protect their hope for the future." />
