      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Vic: Terror Incognita is the 4th novel in the action adventure series The Incredible Adventures of Vic Challenger.&lt;br /&gt;
Vic is preparing for a work related trip up the Amazon river. Vic and her friend Lin Li don&amp;rsquo;t think this will be a picnic. They expect tough conditions, hot weather, mosquitos, wild animals. &amp;nbsp;They can handle it. &amp;nbsp;It&amp;rsquo;s what they do. &amp;nbsp;Readers love to hear about visits to rugged locales. &amp;nbsp;But do they really know what to expect? &amp;nbsp;Over 50,000 miles of savage waterways course through the &amp;nbsp;brutal jungles of the Amazon! &amp;nbsp; Who knows what secrets might lie within an uncharted &amp;nbsp;area as vast as all of Europe? Of course Vic will also have her senses attuned for signs of Nu, her soul mate from 100,000 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lethal encounters begin before the &amp;nbsp;trip begins! Plus, Vic finds her friend Emma has a serious personal problem, two in fact. &amp;nbsp;Vic can&amp;rsquo;t help with one but the other leads to some un-ladylike conduct in the streets of Beatrice. &amp;nbsp;She and &amp;nbsp;Lin both decide that fighting bad guys and monsters is easy compared to social and personal problems. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Vic and Lin Li finally get to the Amazon, Vic has a chance to taste some great local food &amp;nbsp;including rock grilled pirarucu, roasted favolus, and anona fruit. &amp;nbsp;The trip has a good start. &amp;nbsp;Their greatest worry is whether they may run into headhunters. &amp;nbsp;Turns out there is more to worry about. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vic is delighted to learn that her favorite book of all time was not &amp;nbsp;strictly fiction. &amp;nbsp;It sets Vic and Lin on a search into terra incognita, which should be labeled terror incognita! &amp;nbsp;They discover people who need help and Vic does not hesitate.. &amp;nbsp;Enroute they deal with &amp;nbsp;giant snakes, caimans, piranha, a greedy guide, but those are unworthy of mention compared to what awaits them in Terror Incognita!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the lessons learned, it is better to be prepared and not need to be than to be unprepared and dead; anyone can make a mistake and one mistake does not a bad person make and of course, keep your weapon with you!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Fast paced and unpredictable, action adventure in the tradition of the adventure pulps of the early 20th Century. &amp;nbsp;If you like Doc Savage, The Avenger (Dick Benson), Nancy Drew, or Tarzan or any other novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs or H. Rider Haggard you will love Vic Challenger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What reviewers think of the series:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vic Challenger personifies every sword or ax wielding heroine ever drawn by any heroic fantasy artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;the female answer to Indiana Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great Campy Multi-Genre Book&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have recommended the Vic Challenger books to my wife and to all of my children&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any of these novels would make a really good movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;if you like Clive Cussler or James Rollins, these are definitely the books for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Incredible Adventures of Vic Challenger&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp; series is inspired by writers like Edgar Rice Burroughs, H. Rider Haggard, Jules Verne, Arthur Conan Doyle and H. G. Wells; and by characters like Nancy Drew, Lara Croft, Alan Quatermain, Doc Savage and his cousin Patricia Savage, and Dick Benson and his assistant Nellie Gray. &amp;nbsp; The writing style has been compared to Burroughs and is also reminiscent of early &amp;nbsp;action driven horror novels by Graham Masterton,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The series is set in the 1920&amp;rsquo;s and considerable research adds to the &amp;ldquo;realism&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;You will find yourself effortlessly learning bits of history, some of which may amaze you. &amp;nbsp; Vic&amp;rsquo;s travels are so woven into the history of the time, you may be asking yourself &amp;ldquo;Is this real?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
