  <title>Game World - GianLorenzo Cortese</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The robots continued to drag me through doors and corridors, and
I started to panic when I realized that Jan wasnt doing what he was
supposed to do. We went down two floors to the buildings basement.
There were no marble floors or wooden ornamentation down there, only
metal, concrete, and bricks.
I could see the old metal doors of cells as we moved along the
corridors. Faces appeared behind the bars, prisoners made curious by the
arrival of someone new. The basement contained all the cells. It was the
perfect place to hide the ugly side of the Health Agency. The public saw
only the clean, efficient, and caring aspect of the Agency.
One of the robots opened the door of an empty cell, and the other
one pushed me in. I fell on the cold concrete of the floor, and I realized
that I had reached the end. I didnt know what was going on with Jan,
but without his help, Halina and I were lost.
But, as I mentioned before, there are times when life can go one way
or another, and we have no say in which direction it goes. All we can do
is accept fates choice and be its beneficiaries . . . or its victims. Much
later, Jan told me what happened. Or, rather, what he told me made it
GAME WORLD 71
possible to reconstruct what most likely happened. It was probably a fly
that had the honor of deciding whether or not my life would be saved.
Yes, a fly that, in another precinct, in another building, in another room,
was buzzing not far from my friend Jan.
If that little creature had for whatever reason decided to fly elsewhere,
Halina and I would have been dead within the hour. But the fly was
going up and down, with its customary irritating sound, not very far
from Jans fat belly, and it didnt want to go anywhere else.
The cat, sitting on the same belly, was attentively watching the fly,
its eyes following the flys movements. It was waiting for a favorable
opportunity. When such an opportunity arrived, the cat leaped suddenly
to grab the fly. Missing the target, it landed on a vase of flowers located
on a shelf just above the couch where Jan was snoring. Of course the vase
fell, and the water inside the vase poured right onto Jans face. He was
alone and thus not wearing a mantle, and the water rudely awoke the
poor guy from his slumber, like a shocking slap on the face.
After a brief but intense struggle to remember who he was, where he
was, and what he was seeing, the first thing he comprehended was the
meaning of the flashing com on the table in front of him.
Jan jumped to his feet and ran to do what he was supposed to do.
He pushed a switch, and all the magnetic fields of an entire precinct,
the one in which the Health Agency was located, went off. All the door
locks in the building were released, and all the robots in the area stopped
functioning, frozen in place like gigantic broken toys.
The cell doors turned slowly on their hinges and, as if by magic, they
opened in front of the incredulous prisoners eyes.
#
The Abot stiffened in his armchair. What the hell is happening? I
want to know what is going on! He yelled these words at the robots in
the room, but not one of them moved or said anything. He walked up to
the closest robot and yelled again. What are you doing? Do you know I
could destroy you? Speak to me! Obey!
The robot stood in silence. Sardos lips started to shake out of fear. He
walked to the door. He slowly opened it and looked into the hall. There
were motionless robots as far as he could see. Some had been pushed to
the ground. People were running through the corridors. Others were
shouting on the other floors." />
