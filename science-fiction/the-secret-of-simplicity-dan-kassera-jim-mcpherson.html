  <title>The Secret of Simplicity - Dan Kassera, Jim McPherson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Simplicity is a secret place, located in another dimension, which is parallel to our own world. Its just one of many places that exist in the spirit world. Its known only to the select few who have been tricked and abducted from this world and taken there. Thats in the belief that they had just won a free shopping trip to the Mall in Minnesota.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Unknown to them, it is far more than that. The Mall is really not in Minnesota, but somewhere else in that other dimension. Both very good and bad people are taken there. Some of the really bad ones are imprisoned in that strange mall. They are finally brought to justice in some very creative and appropriate ways.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Most are transported from there to a strangely quaint little river town called Simplicity. Those people have all been taken there for very specific reasons. Some find a little piece of heaven there. A few others find themselves trapped in what, for them, is their own personal hell. There is no escape and no plea bargaining.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Train visitors are recruited there to serve a vital cause, once they return home. That is the cause of freedom and liberty back in America. That can only be achieved through well-organized civil disobedience and, perhaps, armed rebellion. A very creative new way has been found to actually make that work. Its a way that big government control freaks are not prepared to deal with.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Simplicity is actually the planning and control center for that operation. Its permanent residents are all freedom lovers eager to serve in that cause. All have lived out their previous lives in America. They had earned their reward here in Simplicity where they live on. However, they are all deceased back in America. They can never go back. They can, though, have a tremendous impact and influence on those who are abducted from America to their spirit world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Thats where the abducted train visitors are actually shown that there really is a spirit world. They can actually meet their dead friends, relatives, and acquaintances. They learn that life really does go on. They also learn that America is forever doomedunless the new plan can be made to work. Thats when they get recruited. They are all promised that their next life will be lived in Simplicity as a reward for their efforts back home.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
What greater proof and incentive could there ever be? Those residents of Simplicity have all passed their final exams and have been promoted to a higher level of existence. If you cant believe them, who can you believe? Now educated and informed, the train visitors return back home, with newfound courage and a tremendous desire to do the right thing. That is because seeing is believing. Those chosen ones had been granted a rare privilege. They actually enter into the spirit world while they are still living in this world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
There, they get a real shock: their proof of immortality! They actually meet the dead who had summoned them. That must be done in a very careful way, so as not to cause heart attacks or fainting spells. Before they are sent back, they are all given two special gifts, completely unattainable in their world. If they ever doubt the experience, those two items will convince them otherwise. One is a large medallion made of a strange material unknown on earth. It says, simply, I was there. The second mystery item is an unbreakable pocket mirror in a leather case. Removed from the case, the mirror emits an eerie glow. Printed below the mirror are the words, I cannot do everything, but I can do something. That which I can do, I ought to do. I will not fail.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Most importantly, the train visitors are recruited into the most secret of all organizations. Its purpose is to restore freedom to America by any means necessary. That is the real secret of Simplicity. Among them is a young man named Joe Quin. He has been tricked into going there, like all the others, but for a different purpose. Joe is a person of spec" />
