  <title>The Subtle Awakening: Book One of Ghosting the Stars - Peter Bishop</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The invention of the Groff changed everything. It propelled people out-of-body and into the shallows of subtle-space, to skim, or ghost, intimately alongside the physical world. As the twenty-first century staggered towards its conclusion everyone was travelling out-of-body, for work or pleasure, legal and illegal. But with new freedoms and opportunities came new forms of power, crime, vulnerability and madness. Now, an immensely powerful SuperGroff could punch minds far deeper.   The Argentinian Collective&#39;s leading scientist, Vicente, has disappeared during a mission into deepest subtle-space. Vicente&#39;s partner Tasha, a renowned psychotherapist, believes it is madness to enter such regions and that out-of-body galactic travel is impossible, merely a dangerous illusion.   As the search for Vicente erupts into full-scale conflicts both in subtle-space and South America, casualties mount, deepest beliefs are challenged and relationships transformed." />
