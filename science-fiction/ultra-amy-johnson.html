  <title>Ultra - Amy Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Commander Conrad, of the US Naval intelligence is dispatched on a top priority mission to Scotland near Moray Firth. Two RAF Jets on a routine exercise over the North Sea have crashed near Moray Firth. At the same time a weather balloon unknown to some carrying sensitive military information has also crashed near Moray Firth. Conrad has to locate the witnesses to both the incidents so that they could be sworn to secrecy. The book deals with both a critical RAF crash, and visitors from space of great relevance to our times. 
Ultra is a hyper-intelligent being who lands with surety in Scotland. As Conrad conducts his search he begins to suspect that someone is peddling him to a kind of fin de sicle to search for the impossible. Conrad is acutely aware of NASA programmes for alien life on other planets and as a child he had read the exploration of space, which painted an optimistic picture of our future expansion into the Universe. 
The stars are not for man, was something he had heard recanted often. He had heard of UFO encounters, and hundred per cent of them were dismissed as nonsense. He however, had been a great fan of The War of the Worlds, despite the fact that SETI (the search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence) had discovered nothing remotely resembling intelligence. Orson Welles too had dismissed all the hype since the beginning of the 20th century when flying saucers had first been reported and Timothy Good and Nick Pope, had provided no new evidence of their existence after the UFO files were declassified. 
Amidst all his ponderings from his witnesses of the crash at both sites that a UFO had caused the crash, Conrad soon realises that he too is being hunted, by some unknown lethal force; that what he was told of the incidents was only one part of an unbelievable story. From Washington to London, to Edinburgh to Moray Firth, the story unfolds when Conrad meets Ultra, who with precision accuracy reveals earths past , and an unusual cosmic alliance begins to form." />
