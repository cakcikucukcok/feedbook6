  <title>Tales of the Phoenix - Kristin Stieffel, Travis Perry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A future Mars, one thousand years from now, which has collapsed back into a Medieval age was the backdrop for the 2015 short story anthology &lt;em&gt;Medieval Mars&lt;/em&gt;. This story world idea imagined that Mars will be gifted with an even thicker atmosphere than Earth. That, coupled with Mars&amp;rsquo; lower gravity, would make airships with relatively small gondolas possible, of the sort common in steampunk artwork. It also would make it possible for human beings to ride giant birds, especially in the places on Mars where the atmosphere is thickest.
