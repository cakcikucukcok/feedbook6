  <title>Birth: The Exquisite Sound of One Hand Falling Off a Turnip Truck - S.T. Gulik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;How perverse can a man become before he is innocent again?&lt;br /&gt; Maxwell Quick hates life, the world, and everything in it. All he wants is to sit in front of his TV and let waves of alcohol cleanse the shore of his mind. Unfortunately, that&amp;#39;s no longer an option.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; After defending himself against a group of mutant terrorists, Max is caught in a web of global conspiracies, terrorist networks and esoteric gibberish at the heart of an underground war for global domination. He knows the Iiite shadow-government is a family-pack of dicks, but should he side with the hyper-intelligent, yet socially retarded Riot Nrrds or the secret cabal within the Iiites that&amp;rsquo;s out to destroy them both? To find the truth, he&amp;rsquo;ll have to navigate backrooms and battlefields while dodging sexy double-agents, cultists, and aliens with agendas of their own. To stay alive, he&amp;#39;ll have to win a game of four-way chess where he&amp;rsquo;s the only pawn, and to regain his freedom he&amp;rsquo;ll have to save the world&amp;mdash;all before he runs out of space on his DVR.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;ldquo;Birth&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; is an epic genre-bending roller-coaster plunging into an ocean of fun filled bonanzas of horror. This first novel of the Chakra Kong trilogy has people, places, and things. Stuff happens! Perfect for fans of money, sex, or food! Explosions! Tender cuddling with bizarre creatures! More explosions!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt; Buy it now! Or else!&lt;/p&gt;" />
