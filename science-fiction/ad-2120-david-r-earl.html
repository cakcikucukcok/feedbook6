  <title>Ad 2120 - David R. Earl</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of  attorney Sean O&#39;Reilly and psychologist Carmen Estrada who marry in the year of 2120.   He belongs to a hard-drinking Irish family, has two brothers, one in the military, and the other owns a commercial real estate firm.  Carmen  is of African-American and Honduran ancestry.  Her brother is a biologist.  
     Women are at the forefront in academics, professions, business, government, politics and other white collar pursuits. America has had several female Presidents.  The strength and aggressiveness of men is no longer necessary because robots and androids do most of the things that men used to do.  
     Until a new law was passed, half of all births were accidental with the less educated women having the most children.  Congress, where women are the majority, passed legislation allowing  birth control medication to be put in the water supply.  Prospective mothers must apply, be tested and obtain permission from the government to have a child. Designer babies, who are now free from most illnesses, outnumber naturally born children.  Birthing labs are available so women do not have to carry the baby.  Sean and Carmen are intent on having a designer baby, called a Tudor, but problems occur. 
     Black women have been mating with what is called &quot;the cream of the white males.&quot;  This infuriates a small number of the African-American men who believe America&#39;s white culture is overrunning their race.  A minority of these black men formed a cabal which worked to stop the mixing of black and white races.
    Nanotechnology has come into its own.  Due to this miraculous technology, Androids are almost human, have high IQs and have become companions to humans.  Many humans live only with an android. They have detailed human female or male gender characteristics of body and mind built into them at the factory.   
     Our sexual paradigm has changed radically toward the liberal persuasion. Some people still get married or register their domestic partnerships, but many men and women live together without any legal status. 
     Murder and other crimes have lessened in civilized society, but atrocities still happen, more often in nations of the Third World.  Many people still do adhere to religion, but others wonder about theories that different entities may have created the Universe. Perhaps by Intelligent Design, an almighty God, or perhaps by random chance.    Humans continue to attempt to obtain equal justice for all." />
