  <title>Oil Busters and Hundred-Man Crew - Tabu Qureshi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bull Mohawk, an offshore rig drilling for oil in the Gulf of Mexico, is about to make a horrific discovery. Unknown to man, trapped beneath Earth&#39;s crust and latched onto oil-filled rock pockets, are things soon to be known as &quot;Oil Busters.&quot; The colorful crew of the Bull Mohawk must struggle to save their rig from an unknown entity. Meanwhile, scientists make their way to the distressed rig to find out why drilling operations seem to be declining in the United States. Other countries, unaware of the Oil Busters, see this as the perfect opportunity to play an awful political game with America and her allies. Our greatest fears have been awakened with the arrival of the Oil Busters. What&#39;s causing the eruption of offshore rigs around the globe? Will the crew of the Bull Mohawk stand and fight or flee the rig? How will the President of the United States save the country from an oil crisis? This catastrophe has been long in the making, but humanity may pull through if we work together." />
