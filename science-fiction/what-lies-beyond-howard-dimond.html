  <title>What Lies Beyond? - Howard Dimond</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Near the end of his life, Nicolaus Copernicus began what became known as a revolution in scientific thought. His findings showed that the Earth was not at the center of the heavens, as had previously been believed. Equally, Galileo was inspired with his own discoveries, only to have a sentence against him, delivered on 22 June 1633.
At this inquisition, Galileo was found guilty of heresy. He was compelled to stop supporting the growing revolution of thought, which reinforced Copernicuss belief on the path of orbiting spheres. These early researchers were seen as a threat to the teachings of biblical scholars and to what had been passed on down through the ages. 
To many others, these men were seen as pioneering researchers who lived in an inspiring age of enlightenment. The frustration felt in their quest for knowledge was more than matched by the authority and ignorance of the church, which chose to accept the Holy Scriptures as they had been written. This was not the first time early researchers with enquiring minds were accused of dissent as a means of controlling religious beliefs.
The power to suppress original thought is not new. Opposing any changes in belief, using the influences of ridicule, scorn, and derision exists today. Attempting to understand our greater universal expanse has been confined to parochial debates for centuries. 
This novel continues the pioneering quest for truth, which faced injustice in its early stages. A quest that sees mankind finally freed from historic levels of influential control, which preceded the churches growing narrow-minded intolerance. Michael and his great friend Oats are two scientists who have resumed this challenge to uncover the secrets, which have been concealed for centuries and over thousands of years. 
Their quest follows an elementary analysis from our earliest of times, to unravel insightful answers to so many of our unsolved global mysteries. To find the hidden unknowns preventing peace, on a world still plagued with endless turmoil and global conflicts. To reveal this history of spiritual and idealistic belief, Michael and Oats began, by following a quite extraordinary chain of fascinating and remarkable events. 
A skillfully reconstructed existence regression unearths the innocence of what an educated society has been taught for centuries. While faith in the future of mankinds age of inspiration and enlightenment is restored and returned to humanity once more." />
