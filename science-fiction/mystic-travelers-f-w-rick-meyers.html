  <title>Mystic Travelers: - F. W. Rick Meyers</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Have you ever wanted to escape to a place where you could order a cup of coffee, a glass of water, and a new life? Michael Wyman has. Disillusioned and in search of something unknown, he finds himself at a cafe on a deserted road in the north woods of Michigans Upper Peninsula at three oclock in the morning. There, he encounters Angelina, the most beautiful woman hes ever met. She takes his order and introduces him to a whole new way of life.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;But what he doesnt know about Angelina could hurt him. Shes the spousal partner of a missing Nobel Prize laureate, William C. FischerMichaels longtime friend and associate. This chance meeting is more than either of them could have imagined. They embark on a twenty-fi rst-century psychological adventure that draws them, and those closest to them, into an intriguing investigation of awareness and self-discovery that uncovers a personal and global crisis concerning life, death, new life, and a common destiny.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Inevitably the intricately woven mysteries of interconnected lives, unexpected entanglements, and what has been called the perennial philosophy asks: &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Who are you?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What do you want?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Why are you here?&lt;/P&gt;" />
