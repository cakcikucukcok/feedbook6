Now Pleckoo is hunted by the army that once revered him. Yet in all his despair, Pleckoo receives prophecies from his termite god, assuring him he &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; kill Anand to rule the Sand, and establish the One True Religion.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And war is not yet over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Anand and Bee-Jor face an eastern threat from the Mad Emperor of the Barley People, intent on retaking stolen lands from a vulnerable and chaotic nation.
