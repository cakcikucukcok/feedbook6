  <title>What Music They Make / the Cape - M. J. Reisen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="While researching for an attempted sequel to a classic horror novel, other intriguing ideas came to mind that were too exciting to resist. The supernatural offers many avenues for exploration and expression. And combining alternative realities within the context of real-world characters and settings provides the opportunity for amusement and fanciful speculation for the writer and also, hopefully, the reader. What Music They Make is a speculation of how undead African American jazz musicians may have plied their trade down South. Their mission is not only to advance this new indigenous art form but to see that certain injustices perpetrated by white supremacists do not go unavenged. The Cape is a conjecture on the creation of Superman by two teenagers from Cleveland. Young Jerry Siegel relates his encounter with what appears to be a crime-fighting revenant and shares this experience with his partner, Joe Shuster." />
