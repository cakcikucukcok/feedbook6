  <title>The Edmond Hamilton MEGAPACK ®: 16 Classic Science Fiction Tales - Edmond Hamilton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Edmond Hamilton. For most people, this name conjures visions of two-fisted space opera -- pure pulp science fiction. And Hamilton -- known as the author of the &quot;Captain Future&quot; series -- was indeed one of the foremost writers of pulp space opera. Over the years, as his work became more polished and sophisticated, he evolved into far more than that: a visionary of the future whose imagination knew no bounds. He was truly a cosmic writer, as stories such as &quot;Devolution&quot; (in this collection) demonstrate. If you are interested in pulp science fiction at its pulpiest, look no farther. Edmond Hamilton is the author for you. &lt;P&gt; Included in this volume: &lt;P&gt; THE DOOR INTO INFINITY&lt;BR&gt; THE LEGION OF LAZARUS&lt;BR&gt; DREAMER&#39;S WORLDS&lt;BR&gt; THE CITY AT WORLD&#39;S END&lt;BR&gt; THE WORLD WITH A THOUSAND MOONS&lt;BR&gt; THE STARS, MY BROTHERS&lt;BR&gt; THE SARGASSO OF SPACE&lt;BR&gt; THE MAN WHO SAW THE FUTURE&lt;BR&gt; THE MONSTER-GOD OF MAMURTH&lt;BR&gt; THE MAN WHO RETURNED&lt;BR&gt; THE SECOND SATELLITE&lt;BR&gt; MONSTERS OF MARS&lt;BR&gt; THE MAN WHO EVOLVED&lt;BR&gt; DEVOLUTION&lt;BR&gt; THE BIRTHPLACE OF CREATION&lt;BR&gt; CORRIDORS OF THE STARS &lt;P&gt; And don&#39;t forget to search this ebook store for &quot;Wildside Megapack&quot; to see more great entries in this series, covering mysteries, westerns, science fiction, historical, and much, much more!" />
