  <title>Scaedrein Infiltration - Puppet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Scaederin Infiltration&lt;/i&gt; depicts the tail end of multiple conspiracies
spanning an eighteen year period and how seemingly insignifi cant
events are determing factors for the fate of three diff erent cultures. Th e
secrets kept the lies told to protect the larger agendas. Th is book tells
of love and confl ict at many levels, the reawakening of the spirit. Th e
civil rights of two diff erent species are under the knife. A majority of
the known galaxy under control by these Scaedreins while the other
remaining galactic super powers sit with their hands tied unable to do
anything at the moment. Th e story is intitially centerd around the fi rst
three main characters whose exploits get them tangled in this web of
deceit, betrayal, and cultural revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A twisting plot that grows while the characters move through corridors,
tunnels, caves, and jungles. Th e questions of where, how, when and
why the events are taking place depicted by other primary characters
in the political world of the story; the Scaedrein Captain; the lead
directors; the Jid commander and Tyagnoome. Th e mid way point is
defi ned by a spear head off ensive designed to engage the enemy at three
diff erent locations; but is it designed to fail?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A connecting signifi cance to a larger piece of this story based deeply on
the beliefs of others, but of the stories Ive read none have ever left me
guessing as much as this book and I wrote it. Th is story is told by unheard
voices sailing across the kintetic web of creation then decpicted
by those who choose to listen, I am Puppet the pen is my master.&lt;/p&gt;" />
