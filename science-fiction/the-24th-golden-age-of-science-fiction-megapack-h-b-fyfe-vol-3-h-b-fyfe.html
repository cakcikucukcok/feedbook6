  <title>The 24th Golden Age of Science Fiction MEGAPACK ®: H.B. Fyfe (vol. 3) - H.B. Fyfe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Golden Age of Science Fiction MEGAPACK™ series focuses on unjustly forgotten science fiction writers. Horace B. Fyfe (1918-1997) was one. An engineer by trade, Fyfe also wrote a long string of popular science fiction and fantasy stories. He published extensively in genre magazines from his first appearance in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; (February 1940) until his last publication in &quot;Analog&quot; (January 1967). Sadly, Alzheimer&#39;s cut short his career, but his family stepped in to save his writing files, including more than 90 unpublished stories and an unpublished historical novel. Most of his unpublished works are in other genres, such as suspense or mainstream, but a few are lost gems, and we are delighted to present two previously unpublished tales here. Included in this volume:&lt;P&gt; OPEN INVITATION&lt;BR&gt; PROTECTED SPECIES&lt;BR&gt; RANSOM&lt;BR&gt; WELCOME, STRANGERS!&lt;BR&gt; SPACE-CONDITIONED&lt;BR&gt; THE CLUTCHES OF RUIN&lt;BR&gt; THE NIGHT OF NO MOON&lt;BR&gt; STAR-LINKED&lt;BR&gt; ROMANCE&lt;BR&gt; ROUTINE REPORT&lt;BR&gt; THE FURIES OF ZHAHNOOR&lt;BR&gt; SINECURE&lt;BR&gt; THINKING MACHINE&lt;BR&gt; ROUND-AND-ROUND TRIP&lt;BR&gt; SPECIAL JOBBERY&lt;BR&gt; TIME LIMIT&lt;BR&gt; SPY SCARE&lt;P&gt; If you enjoy this ebook, don&#39;t forget to search your favorite ebook store for &quot;Wildside Press Megapack&quot; to see more of the 250+ volumes in this series, covering adventure, historical fiction, mysteries, westerns, ghost stories, science fiction -- and much, much more!" />
