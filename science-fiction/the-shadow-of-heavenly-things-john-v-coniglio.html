  <title>The Shadow of Heavenly Things - John V. Coniglio</title>
      <meta name="description" content="SON OF MAN, the first book in THE GODSPEAK CHRONICLES trilogy, tells the extraordinary origin of Cog, a Peacekeeper war machine that awakens to sentience in the year 2454, and how his life mysteriously begins to parallel that of Christ when He walked the Earth. THE SHADOW OF HEAVENLY THINGS, the second in the series, traces the development of Cogs unexpected ministry, and the furtherance of his remarkable powers and healing abilities. In WAR OF THE THIRD HEAVEN, the epic comes to a stunning climax as Cog struggles to determine his ultimate destiny amid the cataclysmic events at the end of the Age of Man. 
A deeply human drama told through the life of the solar systems first autonomic humanoid machine.
