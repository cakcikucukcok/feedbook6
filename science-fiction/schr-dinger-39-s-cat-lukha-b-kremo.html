&lt;br /&gt;
He has been taking part in mail art since 2000 and in this artistic context created in 2004 the micro-nation &amp;ldquo;Nazione Oscura Caotica&amp;rdquo; which in 2009 acquired the Neo-republic of Torriglia to celebrate the 1944 partisan republic of Torriglia, and in 2014 acquired &amp;ldquo;Livorno Citt&amp;agrave; Aperta&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
At a non-professional level he has also published experimental electronic music CDs and DVDs under the pseudonym Krell, and organized the Sonora Commedia project.&lt;br /&gt;
After living in Milan for many years he now divides his time between Milan, Livorno, and Torriglia (in the Province of Genoa).&lt;br /&gt;
