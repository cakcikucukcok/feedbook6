      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Is the United States safe from a major terrorist attack? Could an Islamic terror group amass a large enough army on American soil to challenge the Great Satan, with all its security, intelligence gathering and worldwide watchdogs? How could that many terrorists be hidden in plain sight? Where will they come from? How will they get into the US without raising suspicion?&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Andy, Lindsey and Col. Mac try to identify and stop what they believe to be Islamic mercenaries from amassing a large army and striking the very heart of the US. At the same time, they try to stop their own government from attacking our alien visitors, while protecting their own lives from an evil power determined to destroy them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will Andys loyalty to Col. Mac and the US be strong enough to pull him away from his dying wife? Where is Lucy, his supercharged cyber partner who has been by his side from the beginning? Can she help? Will she? Who in the government is helping the terrorists and why?&lt;/p&gt;" />
