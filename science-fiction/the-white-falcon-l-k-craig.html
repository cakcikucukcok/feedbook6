  <title>The White Falcon - L.K. Craig</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many years ago, in a world very different from your own, a child of prophecy was born. Stolen from the safety of his mothers arms, the heir to the throne of Giervalk was taken to another world; the world of mankind.
Just prior to Gabriels sixteenth birthday, Rayla, a witch from Giervalk, opens a portal between the two worlds. It is through her that Gabriel learns he is the key to ending a war that has plagued Giervalk for generations. But Gabriel is uncertain about this new responsibility. He wants to learn to drive a car; not fight a dark force that has invaded a world he has never seen. 
While Gabriel attempts to accept and blend his two identities, the darkness presses closer. He can no longer ignore his calling. Gabriel must protect the family and world that he loves. So together with a healer, witch, archer, warrior, and fairy, Gabriel travels to places he has only imagined in his wildest dreams and most feared nightmares." />
