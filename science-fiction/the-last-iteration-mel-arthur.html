  <title>The Last Iteration - Mel Arthur</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The only way to learn about your enemy is to die with your enemy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seven people, stolen from a Civil War, dropped into a sterile, featureless maze must learn to trust each other, fight off packs of bizarre monsters, if they&amp;#39;re going to survive.&amp;nbsp; But when the labyrinth resets itself again and again, they realize someone is watching them. Someone with an agenda. Is this some trap from the oppressive ruling Tris family, or is it a weapon of the freedom fighters, and what does the monstrous Grey--a creature inside the maze--want with them?&amp;nbsp; Hanian Tris, not even a real general, hasn&amp;#39;t seen much battle, but he&amp;#39;ll learn from two highly skilled women, Ciege and Elise, &amp;nbsp;freedom fighters&amp;nbsp;in the Resistance. Working together, they might have a chance to escape the battles that bring them to the brink of Death...and back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The Last Iteration is written for a more mature audience than the Maze Runner and deals heavily with the internal motivation and personalities of the characters. With such a spartan setting, the characters must do the lion&amp;#39;s share of the work to drive the story forward and the novel is as much a study of them as it is a story about how they get out of the labyrinth.&amp;quot; - Mel Arthur, author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;" />
