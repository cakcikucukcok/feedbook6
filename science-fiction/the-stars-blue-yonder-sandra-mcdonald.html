  <title>The Stars Blue Yonder - Sandra McDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Chief Terry Myell died and became a god. Now he&#39;s back to life, careening around space and time at the behest of a voice that told him to save all of mankind. Helping and hindering this quest are his elderly wife, his young wife, grandchildren who haven&#39;t been born yet, romantic rivals he hasn&#39;t even met, a descendant from two thousand years in the future, and an alien nemesis who calls itself the Flying Doctor. Life in the military has never been so complicated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commander Jodenny Scott would agree. She&#39;s seven months pregnant and trying to come to peace with her husband&#39;s death. When Myell reappears with tales of time travel, she&#39;s not sure what to believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with an invading army bearing down on Earth&#39;s last fleet of spaceships, there&#39;s not much time for debate. When the dust clears Jodenny is stranded in an Australia she never imagined, and Myell&#39;s more desperate than ever to rescue her--from aliens, from treachery, and from history itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
