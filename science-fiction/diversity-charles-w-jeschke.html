  <title>Diversity - Charles W. Jeschke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfG2_ileinner&quot;&gt;Reading is my passion. I read Science Fiction, Mystery and Adventure. I have probably read over 10,000 books in my short lifetime. Since taking three years of English during High School, writing short stories which impressed my teachers, I have continued to dabble in writing a book. After I got my degree in Electrical Engineering including tutoring in related disciplines, I worked in various divisions of the department of the Navy. This got me interested in people involved in shipboard activities and how they maintain their sanity. I started writing this book in 1985, but I gave it up and being too difficult to try to put three books in one. By 2006, I decided to try again only this time I would write it as a trilogy. Now I have had several readers read it in its&#39; various renditions and am ready to publish. Currently, I reside in downtown Seattle where I can see the mountains, the sea and the ships on the sea.&lt;/div&gt;" />
