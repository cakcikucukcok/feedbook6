  <title>Through a Forest of Stars - David C Jeffrey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Year 2217&lt;/em&gt;. Earth&amp;rsquo;s biosphere is dying, Mars&amp;rsquo;s terraforming projects are in ruin, resource wars are brewing, and even the discovery of voidoids&amp;mdash;eerie neo-quantum portals into nearby star systems&amp;mdash;has failed to yield other habitable worlds in Bound Space. But that&amp;rsquo;s about to change. Aiden Macallan, Terra Corp&amp;rsquo;s maverick planetologist aboard the survey ship &lt;em&gt;Argo&lt;/em&gt;, is plunged to the center of a deadly conflict over a miraculous discovery in the Chara system, 27 light years from Earth. For a dying human race, the discovery of Silvanus should be a cause for rejoicing. Instead, humanity is on the brink of a catastrophic war over its possession.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Aiden has even deeper concerns. Long before his arrival in the Chara system, he&amp;rsquo;s been haunted by a recurring dream that transports him to a lush alien forest where pagan archetypes grow frighteningly real, and more personal, with each step. Now a skirmish between the Unified Earth Domain and the Allied Republics of Mars has left him crash-landed on Silvanus, alone on a world profoundly mysterious yet strangely familiar. As he is dawn deeper into its exquisite beauty, he soon encounters startling proof of the Gaia Hypothesis fully realized. The keys to the restoration of Earth&amp;rsquo;s dying biosphere and the terraforming of Mars are here for the taking, but only if Aiden can solve the deeper puzzle of why Silvanus is killing itself.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His search for answers is guided by an eccentric AI whose highly advanced neural net and fondness for jazz enables it to communicate with potential alien intelligences. But internally Aiden must rely on his evolving dream for direction, and on his love for Skye Landen&amp;mdash;a beautiful Gaian scientist from the Lovelock Institute&amp;mdash;for vision and resolve. Determined to help Aiden in his quest, Skye enlists the aid of the brilliant Gaian physicist, Elgin Woo. Together they set out for Silvanus aboard the &lt;em&gt;Starhawk&lt;/em&gt;, Woo&amp;rsquo;s outlandish experimental spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But time is running out. Cole Brahmin, Terra Corp&amp;rsquo;s malevolent jackal gone rogue, is racing toward Silvanus aboard the battle cruiser &lt;em&gt;Conquest&lt;/em&gt; spreading chaos in his wake and pursuing foul designs of his own in which the ruination of Silvanus is only a prelude. Meanwhile, Aiden must trek across a living landscape in a race against time to save an extraordinary world from destruction&amp;mdash;a world that holds the secret to humanity&amp;rsquo;s survival. They&amp;rsquo;re all on a collision course that can end only in the destruction of civilization or its ultimate salvation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
