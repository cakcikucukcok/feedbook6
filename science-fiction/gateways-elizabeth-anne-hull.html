  <title>Gateways - Elizabeth Anne Hull</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;An anthology of new, original stories by bestselling science fiction authors, inspired by science fiction great Frederik Pohl&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;It isn&#39;t easy to get a group of bestselling SF authors to write new stories for an anthology, but that&#39;s what Elizabeth Anne Hull has done in this powerhouse book. With original, captivating tales by Greg Bear, Gregory Benford, Ben Bova, David Brin, Cory Doctorow, Neil Gaiman, Joe Haldeman, Harry Harrison, Larry Niven, Vernor Vinge, Gene Wolfe, and others, &lt;i&gt;Gateways &lt;/i&gt;is a SF event that will be a must-buy for SF readers of all tastes, from the traditional to the cutting edge; from the darkly serious to the laugh-out-loud funny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each author has written a story that he or she feels reflects the effect Pohl has had on the field--in the style of writing, the narrative tone, or the subject matter. It says a lot about Pohl&#39;s career that the authors represented here themselves span many decades and styles, from the experimental SF of British SF author Brian W. Aldiss to the over-the-top humor of Harry Harrison and Mike Resnick, from the darkly powerful drama of Hollywood screenwriter Frank Robinson to the satiric pungency of multiple Hugo Award-winner Vernor Vinge. Every story here is uniquely nuanced; all of them as entertaining and thought provoking as Pohl&#39;s fiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a career dating back to 1939, Pohl has won all the awards science fiction has to offer: Hugos, Nebulas, the SFWA Grand Master Award. Having written more than two million words of fiction and edited the groundbreaking Star anthologies and Hugo Award-winning magazines and books, Pohl is an SF icon. This anthology of brilliant, entertaining SF stories is a testament to his stature in the field. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
