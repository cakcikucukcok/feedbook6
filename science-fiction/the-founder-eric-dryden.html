  <title>The Founder - Eric Dryden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1992, Mark Wyden, a youngish professor, is driven into social isolation because of his stubborn and politically incorrect worldview. Ironically, this fish out of water is driven by his deep sense of alienation and loneliness into creating a private fantasy world. He&#39;s contracted with a brilliant eccentric inventor friend, to be a human guinea pig for testing a new machine. But the unexpected happens, and during the experiment, the course of his life, and eventually of the world, is altered. This novel traces the events that lead this tortured man out of his late-twentieth century obscurity into the distant future. It chronicles his adventures through the chaotic new world order of the turbulent twenty-first century, and it follows his quest for survival beyond that era into a new civilization built on the ruins of his own. Facing personal dangers, Wyden is forced to learn the art of courageous action. He makes shocking discoveries that vindicate the pursuits of his previous stubborn isolation." />
