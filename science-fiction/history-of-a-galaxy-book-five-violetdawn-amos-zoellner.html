  <title>History of a Galaxy: Book Five - Violetdawn - Amos Zoellner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Captain Redbeard has a penchant for telling tall tales and unlikely stories. So when he and his companions are stranded on a remote African beach, he launches into one of his greatest sagas yet, a compelling account of his younger years-battling pirates, fighting sea serpents, and discovering the legendary Fountain of Yuth. But he had no idea just how important this tale was, that he and others would have an impact not only on the rest of earth&#39;s history, but that of the entire galaxy. In this book, you will meet the characters who really mattered in ages past, including: An aquaphobic accountant turned pirate-in-training A dastardly buccaneer bent on discovering El Dorado. A solitary rigger who cherishes his pet lizards. A Xenonite Ciri whose mind is torn between opposing desires. A tiny leprechaun searching for violet. And a wandering Sheek who is about to lose his mind." />
