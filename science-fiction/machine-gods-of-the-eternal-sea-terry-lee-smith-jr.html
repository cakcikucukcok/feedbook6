  <title>Machine Gods of the Eternal Sea - Terry Lee Smith Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In a time of uncertainty, humanity has touched the stars and claimed vast worlds under the unified Nations of Earth. Yet beneath the heels of the Mother World, the colonists grow too strong. Soon after, a war unlike any seen before would last for twenty years wherever independence had a voice. Towering machines, known as Unit Fighters, were piloted by the brave as historic battles were fought. And after nine years of peace between the newly established Pride Systems of Devoir-Con passed, the scars of such a mad war were not only left on the worlds they shed blood on but on the soldiers and soon-to-be combatants of Devoir. These are just a few of their stories as, once again, the torn and gritty flag of Devoir-Con will be raised among the controversies of war, peace, love, struggle, and innocents lost." />
