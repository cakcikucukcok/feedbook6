  <title>Plague Ship - André Norton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dane Thorson, Cargo-master-apprentice of the Solar Queen, Galactic Free Trader spacer, Terra registry, stood in the middle of the ship&amp;#39;s cramped bather while Rip Shannon, assistant Astrogator and his senior in the Service of Trade by some four years, applied gobs of highly scented paste to the skin between Dane&amp;#39;s rather prominent shoulder blades. The small cabin was thickly redolent with spicy odors and Rip sniffed appreciatively.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re sure going to be about the best smelling Terran who ever set boot on Sargol&amp;#39;s soil,&amp;quot; his soft slur of speech ended in a rich chuckle.&lt;br /&gt;
Dane snorted and tried to estimate progress over one shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The things we have to do for Trade!&amp;quot; his comment carried a hint of present embarrassment. &amp;quot;Get it well in&amp;mdash;this stuff&amp;#39;s supposed to hold for hours. It&amp;#39;d better. According to Van those Salariki can talk your ears right off your head and say nothing worth hearing. And we have to sit and listen until we get a straight answer out of them. Phew!&amp;quot; He shook his head. In such close quarters the scent, pleasing as it was, was also overpowering. &amp;quot;We would have to pick a world such as this&amp;mdash;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Rip&amp;#39;s dark fingers halted their circular motion. &amp;quot;Dane,&amp;quot; he warned, &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t you go talking against this venture. We got it soft and we&amp;#39;re&amp;nbsp;going to be credit-happy&amp;mdash;if it works out&amp;mdash;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
But, perversely, Dane held to a gloomier view of the immediate future. &amp;quot;&lt;i&gt;If&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;quot; he repeated. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s a galaxy of &amp;#39;ifs&amp;#39; in this Sargol proposition. All very well for you to rest easy on your fins&amp;mdash;you don&amp;#39;t have to run about smelling like a spice works before you can get the time of day from one of the natives!&amp;quot;" />
