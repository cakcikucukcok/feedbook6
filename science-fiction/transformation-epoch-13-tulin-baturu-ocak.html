  <title>Transformation: Epoch 13 - Tulin Baturu OCAK</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t even remember how I dashed out from the caravan which was settled between two gigantic trees with a snowy mountain view in the botanic garden of Victoria University of Wellington. Have you ever experienced the burning of your soul without pain? Do you know the feeling of drowning with a blast in your chest? Running frantically without even the slightest fear of death? Thinking about nothing beside challenging everything? I was getting hurt but I was not afraid. Before I found myself in a pub at Courtenay Place in Te Aro, I had been walking in the depths of the night, struggling with dense thoughts and feelings. All I wanted was to relax and to lose nothing. With the hope of killing my pain, I dropped by a pub owned by the most famous showman of New Zealand. He used to come to there when he did not have a program. He was a single, handsome guy with his straight fair hair and dark, blackish eyes, around his forties. Combatant was a Maorian, like me. He was the one admired by all the young ladies. Thanks to his shows and private life, he proved to the people of New Zealand that he had a steady character, a steady character that gave me the second chance. How could I know that Combatant would be the one saving my life?&lt;/p&gt;" />
