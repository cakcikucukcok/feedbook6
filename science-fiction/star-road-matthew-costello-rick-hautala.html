  <title>Star Road - Matthew Costello, Rick Hautala</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A rebel and an outlaw lead an unsuspecting group of adventurers on a secret mission across the vastness of space, in Matthew Costello&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Star Road&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Ivan Delgato, a former leader of a rebel group called the Runners, is released from jail on the condition that he carry out a secret mission for the World Council. His assignment is simple: stay under cover, but do absolutely anything necessary to reach the planet Omega IX and offer the renegade Runners clemency if they surrender---which may be complicated since Ivan&#39;s brutally violent brother has taken lead of the Runners in Ivan&#39;s absence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In search of the Runners, Ivan catches a ride out to the wildest reaches of the galaxy via a mysterious transportation system, the Star Road. His fellow passengers on Star Road Vehicle-66 are a suspicious group, all with their own hidden reasons for traversing the star road. As the travelers contend with increasingly deadly encounters, it isn&#39;t long before suspicions build against Ivan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And as the Runners must choose one brother over the other, on a planet filled with ancient secrets, those who survive will confront a mystery that changes the Star Road, and humanity, forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
