  <title>Re-Emergence - Erika Judit Kovﾃ，S</title>
      <meta name="description" content="At the dawn of the 22nd century a cosmic-scale secret is revealed at the deathbed of a dying scientist. What makes this information so special and esoteric?
Floods, drought, and pandemics sweep across the world. By 2030 half of Earth&#39;s population is wiped out. Those who survive choose different paths. American society regresses to a medieval Dark Age, others, who manage to escape, build a new civilization from scratch. With the help of Zita&#39;s invention, mankind sends a spaceship to terraform planet Mars. What they find there affects them profoundly. Some astronauts perish, but --with Masha&#39;s discovery and Martian intervention --the last two are saved. The captain falls into a coma, and the most influential encounter humankind has ever faced rests on the shoulders of Ocean alone. A mysterious new reality is revealed. Her perspectives and views are exposed and come under scrutiny. Will humanity pass the test?
In the Americas, young rebels form a secret alliance. Two of their leaders, Mirella and Kyle, vow to find the long-lost scientists and end the oppression. When they get separated, their lives take an unexpected turn. Mirella goes through indescribable suffering. Will her determination prevail? The newly founded nations decide to unite humanity, the stage is set, and a global-scale search takes place.
When Ocean returns to Earth, an unforeseen chain of events occurs. She&#39;s entrusted with the greatest secret of all. The fate of humanity is forever turned. Will mankind be able to re-emerge? Who plays the key role in the Cosmos? Beliefs are challenged, lives are changed, and nothing will ever be the same. Civilizations meet, and bonds form as humanity approaches its destiny. 
The final twist of the story sets the stage for the second installment of the trilogy, and promises even more mystery to untangle the Cosmic Enigma." />
