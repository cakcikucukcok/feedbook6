  <title>Altered Pathways - David O. Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Since the beginning of his writing career, Dave Rice has attempted
to include an underlying theme of the continuing struggle between
good and evil within the novels basic storyline. This is obvious in his
fi rst novel with this underlying theme in Recovery the Hard Way. A story
that describes the lifestyle of those souls that are addicted to drugs and the
internal struggle they must endure to recover from addiction. This theme
of good over evil is even more apparent in his second novel Justice for All
which chronicles a transformation into an alternative lifestyle, and the moral
implications that the central character must endure because of his career as
a leader in the New World Church and the transformation.
These and other literary works written by Dave Rice such as; Just a Chick
on the Side, and The Women of Conjure, all have plots that contain an
element of confl ict between good and evil.
However, not one of his novels currently in publication goes to the extent
of good challenging evil as that contained in his latest effort, Altered
Pathways, which is based on evolutionary changes that have created what
is known as a Serial Killer.
Explore the ultimate confrontation of evil over good in the latest mystery novel
by Dave Rice, Altered Pathways. It is a compelling psychological mystery that
not only contains murder, but also contains the drama that is brought out in
those that are preyed upon by this demon." />
