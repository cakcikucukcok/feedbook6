  <title>Vtt - Timothy LaBadie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="VTT is a mind-bending story within a story set in San Francisco and New Orleans in the late 1990s. In this science fiction novel you meet a reincarnated boy who remembers having been killed not so long ago, a voodoo priestess who can shoot sparks from her fingertips, a carnie magician with gold contact lenses who wants to take over the world, a deranged computer technician, a house that sounds like its having an orgasm, a headless goat, a laughing rabbit, and a snake tattoo that crawls. 
The antihero, Crazy Jack, at age thirty, is on a permanent LSD trip. He lives with his cat in the basement of an old Victorian. Jacks friend Charm is a tattoo artist and free spirit raised in Sebastopol. 
Binding everything together is a virtual technology that has gone awry. All who even touch it are held captive by it. 
VTT includes three love stories, two failed marriages, a murder mystery, and as many illusions, delusions, and hallucinations as could possibly fit within its covers. Its a sci-fi adventure that moves characters from one city to another, natural to supernatural, boyhood to adulthood, and mystery to enlightenment. There is something here for everyone." />
