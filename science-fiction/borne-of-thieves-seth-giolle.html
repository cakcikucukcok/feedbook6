  <title>Borne of Thieves - Seth Giolle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Borne of Thieves tells of a time two hundred years after the last age of recognized heroes. The Kingdom of Oenar and his brother Jerdann has fallen into history, and the plights of Keiritte Alo, the Hawk, Osseeth Zil and those who fought with them have dropped into legend. With the dawning of their world&#39;s Second Darkening, dark magic blossoms, and shadows spread until history is but a pained memory for hopeful sovereigns and dogged dreamers, and few remember the old legends at all.     Ellec is a common thief with dreams of a nobler future. The sixteen year old is sent across the Wilds as an Imposter Prince in the effort to build an alliance and bring the world closer to that old ideal, the Council of Kings. He aims to bring back a time when the suns shone bright and human magics were used to heal, not harm. Along the way, he&#39;ll discover that true peace cannot be found before true evil has been given a name and a face. In a world that lives in shadow, true deeds are borne of thieves." />
