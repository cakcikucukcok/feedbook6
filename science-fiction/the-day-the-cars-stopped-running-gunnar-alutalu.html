  <title>The Day the Cars Stopped Running - Gunnar Alutalu</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Due to forces beyond human control, motorized traffic stops world-wide. Governments react by taking control of available resources, imposing temporary rationing, enacting new laws, providing incentives and encouragement to new commercial enterprises. The former fossil-fuelled economy needs to be replaced by the new, environmentally friendly one.   Citizens react by discovering new business opportunities and by finding new careers. Forced initially to revert to primitive transport methods of a century ago, they soon adapt to the new realities of a changed world, and throw their energies into building a new, modern and environmentally friendly civilization.   New talents are discovered; new alliances and friendships are forged. The economy starts moving again. Reports of successful new enterprises abound. Human inventiveness triumphs.   Young people meet under unusual circumstances, romance blooms, and together they face the challenging future and join their fellow humans in building a better world." />
