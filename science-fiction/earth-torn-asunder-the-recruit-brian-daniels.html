  <title>Earth Torn Asunder: The Recruit - Brian Daniels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Following the devastation of the Great War, the Earth lies in ruins.  Many of the nations of the world no longer exist. Some have been torn apart, other joined into one new nation. Born out of fears and paranoia, most of the remaining nations as well as the new emerging ones start to pass new rigid laws to ensure the survival of their people. Fifteen year old Alexander Reed falls victim to the now decades old harsh laws of the Northern States of America and is forced into military service.  He and others like him become an unwilling part of the established system. But is there more going on than first appears? As Alex and his new teammates struggle to make sense of everything going on around them and survive in the cold and uncaring world they are now part of, decisions will be made that could mean life or death to them all. Can Alex overcome the odds and escape the horrors that await him in the military or will he ultimately be broken and remain a soldier for the rest of his life?" />
