      <meta name="description" content="Long ages after the god-like Others unleashed the Genetic Wars that annihilated Old Earth, war is once again threatening to consume the planet, shattering an uneasy peace between the remnant races of that primordial conflict. Kiel, First Commander of the reptilian Eligor Empires intelligence service, is obsessed with seeking out help from the primitive human Protectorate in order to determine why the once-benign insect-like Ikonians are suddenly and inexplicably on the rampage, and together, find a way of stopping them. Bishop, the human selected to assist Kiel, has little love for the Eligor but is forced by the masters of his knightly order to comply with the plea for help due to his unique and prophetic ability to use certain Old Earth technologies. Prophecy could finally be fulfilled and order restored to the Protectorate if Bishop is successful. Unfortunately the near-magical and awesome science of the Others does not give up its secrets easily and whats worse, Bishop must journey to the very heart of Ikonia wherein awaits an even greater threat, a threat out of time itself, and with nothing but a hated reptilian Eligor, and an ill-bred Wolf-bird for company." />
