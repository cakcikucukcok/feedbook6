Pollinator drones never sting or bite. They simply do their jobs.&lt;br /&gt;
Then crops all over Mossera 4 begin to fail.&lt;br /&gt;
Will Jim discover the cause before starvation, or worse, turns his dream life into a nightmare?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;An excerpt from&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Restricted Species&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Maerlis leaned forward, holding the comm in her lap. &amp;ldquo;I know we&amp;rsquo;re a fresh food outpost, so I hate to ask. What happens to our supplies in that time?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Considering that the freighters won&amp;rsquo;t bring a damn thing with them?&amp;rdquo; Jim said. &amp;ldquo;Besides what little we can&amp;rsquo;t grow here. Even if we warn them, they won&amp;rsquo;t likely be able to detour to another supply planet.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;There aren&amp;rsquo;t any other ones close by.&amp;rdquo; Rob&amp;rsquo;s face was as pale as it had been flushed.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Not that they could re-route to.&amp;rdquo; Jim scrubbed his face. His brain didn&amp;rsquo;t want to see the answer, much less say it out loud. &amp;ldquo;We won&amp;rsquo;t actually starve to death. At least I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. You&amp;rsquo;ll know the nutritional deficiencies we&amp;rsquo;ll run into better than I do, Maerlis, with a year or more before we get a good harvest. But we&amp;rsquo;ll have a planet full of miserable cadets and furious miners on our hands.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Jim kept his true worries, and his memories, to himself. He&amp;rsquo;d seen people as rough and hardened as the miners on a desolate planet. At the end of the last wars on Earth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
He knew how more shortages and hardships they weren&amp;rsquo;t prepared for could turn a difficult situation into a nasty one." />
