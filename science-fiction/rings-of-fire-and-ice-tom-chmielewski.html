  <title>Rings of Fire and Ice - Tom Chmielewski</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ed Ferald is preparing to take the &lt;em&gt;Cydonia Zach&lt;/em&gt; on the fastest trip ever from Mars to Saturn, revolutionizing interplanetary travel time from months and weeks into days. So why are so many corporate execs, lawyers, politicians and thugs determined to stop the &lt;em&gt;Zach&lt;/em&gt; from getting there?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the &lt;em&gt;Zach&lt;/em&gt; does reach Saturn Science Station safely, Ed doesn&amp;rsquo;t expect the Titan staff to welcome him and his crew with open arms. Open rebellion seems more likely, for the&amp;nbsp;mission of Zach&amp;#39;s is to evict the staff and close the station.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what haunts the captain most are his own memories of what occurred at Saturn. Worse is his fear of repercussions should a reporter on board finally&amp;nbsp;unravel&amp;nbsp;the 15-year mystery behind the wreck of a legendary ship, a mystery wrapped in Saturn&amp;rsquo;s rings and buried among the dark reaches of its frigid moons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some secrets that best stay buried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is set in a plausible science fiction setting of early the early 22nd century, yet the writing doesn&amp;rsquo;t delve into the nuts, bolts, and protons of the science involved. The author, after all, is an English major, not a physicist. Instead, the story focuses on the people who live and work on Mars and elsewhere off Earth, interjected with humor, and sharpened by the dangers they face. Ed and his uncle&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;business consultant,&amp;rdquo; Faizah, an expert in corporate intelligence and who knows what else, have to struggle to keep one step ahead of forces trying to stop them. They face the threat through wit and guile, and a few sparks between them, along with help from unexpected sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rings of Fire and Ice&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;is a complete story in itself, but it continues the arc that began with&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Lunar Dust, Martian Sands,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;and will continue in a third installment of the series.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
