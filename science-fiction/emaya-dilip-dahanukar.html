  <title>Emaya - Dilip Dahanukar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Can we stop Global Warming? 
Can we do without Nuclear Power? 
Are we going to face Famine? 
Are we all doomed? 
You will find the answers in eMaya.
A computer whiz kid created Bitsy, an Artificial Intelligence program to make a report on global warming. She copied her reasoning and comprehension ability to computer Guhu who managed the search engine and to computer Miki who ran the encyclopedia on the internet. These three intelligent byte-brains brought out the myths and the truths of environment change and climate control by interacting amongst them. eMaya was the netname of Bitsy who summarized the discussions and wrote out emails on various aspects of climate control.
Though eMaya is science fiction, the facts about the Earth are real and the conclusions are valid. The book explains difficult concepts of environment and climate change in very simple and lucid way. It answers questions about global warming which you are afraid to ask. eMaya is net-active. She scuttles the plan of using a nuclear bomb to create cloud of dust for global cooling by explaining the concept of temperature equilibrium on Earth. She dramatizes an impending famine situation created with the falling stocks of food to project the importance of carbon dioxide in food production. She will enlighten you about the wonderful design of the earth with its carbon cycle, water cycle and thermal balance. You will be wiser to what is essentially needed to deal with problems of power, food, and global warming. 
Dont you want to know what the World will be like in 2040?" />
