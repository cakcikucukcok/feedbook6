  <title>Brain Thief - Alexander Jablokov</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bernal Haydon-Rumi, executive assistant to a funder of eccentric projects, drops by his boss&#39;s house on the way home from a business trip. By the next morning, he&#39;s been knocked out, his wealthy socialite boss Muriel has stolen a car and vanished, and the AI designed for planetary exploration that she&#39;s been funding turns out to be odder than it should be. In figuring out what&#39;s going on, Bernal has to deal with an anti-AI activist toting a handmade electronic arsenal, a local serial killer, a drug dealer with a business problem, a cryonic therapist stalked by past mistakes--and someone who specifically wants Bernal dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Brain Thief&lt;/i&gt; is a fun, literate speculative fiction adventure, sort of New England cyberpunk noir, set a year or ten from now, somewhere between the Berkshires and Boston, and includes, at no extra charge, a 30-foot-tall fiberglass cowgirl.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
