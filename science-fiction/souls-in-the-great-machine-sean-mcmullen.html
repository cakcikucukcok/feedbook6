  <title>Souls in the Great Machine - Sean Mcmullen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Souls in the Great Machine&lt;/i&gt; is the first volume of Sean McMullen&#39;s brilliant future history of the world of Greatwinter. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The great Calculor of Libris was forced to watch as Overmayor Zarvora had four of its components lined up against a wall and shot for negligence. Thereafter, its calculations were free from errors, and that was just as well-for only this strangest of calculating machines and its two thousand enslaved components could save the world from a new ice age. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And all the while a faint mirrorsun hangs in the night sky, warning of the cold to come. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Sean McMullen&#39;s glittering, dynamic, and exotic world two millennia from now, there is no more electricity, wind engines are leading-edge technology, librarians fight duels to settle disputes, steam power is banned by every major religion, and a mysterious siren &quot;Call&quot; lures people to their death. Nevertheless, the brilliant and ruthless Zarvora intends to start a war in space against inconceivably ancient nuclear battle stations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unbeknownst to Zarvora, however, the greatest threat to humanity is neither a machine nor a force but her demented and implacable enemy Lemorel, who has resurrected an obscene and evil concept from the distant past: Total War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
