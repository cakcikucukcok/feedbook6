  <title>Convergence - S.A. Seal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tomas Companion is a smart guy with a mediocre life.  Hes had numerous opportunities to improve his station but they just have not panned out.  His fate takes a tumble for the worse when a series of fateful encounters leaves him at the gate of involuntary retirement and sorely short of income.   And then providence chooses an out of the world future for this Midwestern working-class nobody.
Author S. A. Seal applies realistic and existing technology to a story that takes the reader from the frozen snow banks of Minneapolis, Minnesota to the icy half-pipe snowboard courses of Valles Marineras, Mars.
But the story doesnt end there.  In the process of enjoying low-gravity hang-time Companion is introduced to a reality that will change the way humankind works, plays, fights and prays.
It is only a matter of time before this work of fiction becomes reality." />
