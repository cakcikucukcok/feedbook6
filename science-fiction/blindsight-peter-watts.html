  <title>Blindsight - Peter Watts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blindsight&lt;/i&gt; is the Hugo Award-nominated novel by Peter Watts, &quot;a hard science fiction writer through and through and one of the very best alive&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The Globe and Mail). &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Two months have past since a myriad of alien objects clenched about the Earth, screaming as they burned. The heavens have been silent since--until a derelict space probe hears whispers from a distant comet. Something talks out there: but not to us. Who should we send to meet the alien, when the alien doesn&#39;t want to meet? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Send a linguist with multiple-personality disorder and a biologist so spliced with machinery that he can&#39;t feel his own flesh. Send a pacifist warrior and a vampire recalled from the grave by the voodoo of paleogenetics. Send a man with half his mind gone since childhood. Send them to the edge of the solar system, praying you can trust such freaks and monsters with the fate of a world. You fear they may be more alien than the thing they&#39;ve been sent to find--but you&#39;d give anything for that to be true, if you knew what was waiting for them. . . .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
