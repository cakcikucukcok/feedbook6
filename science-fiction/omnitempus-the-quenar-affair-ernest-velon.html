  <title>Omnitempus / the Quenar Affair - Ernest Velon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Who would have guessed, in the twentieth year of His Glorys reign, the peace of an entire Galactic Dominion would be shattered.  Like a pane of silicon glass, clear and unblemished, broken by a sudden malevolent blow.  To those happy, prosperous people of faraway Playsaria, who are enjoying the fruits and blessings of the famed Pax Amaziana, that shattering unveiled a sudden monstrous design.  Without notice, seething tentacles unraveled from a central pit causing the strangulation of so many fine comrades.  A sickening malignancy, striking at the very heart of what people cherish as decent, swept down like a wave of churning death.  Planetary systems, nameless and innocent, teeming with the bounty of their fathers efforts, are torn apart like a piece of meat in a pair of ravenous jaws.  Desperate populations, wallowing in the ruins of their worst nightmares, witnessed horrors surged up from the abysmal depths of chaos, engulfing all.  
         Only a sane mind would recoil in anguish, crying out for justice in the emptiness" />
