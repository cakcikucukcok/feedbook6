  <title>The Stone Messiahs : Book Two - The Circle - Mr Kit Gleave</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Terracan, Vicehorn, the Tel bi Ree are all gone, fallen to dust. Only those known as the Four survive the 60 forgotten millennia, thrown across an ocean of time to find the Dreaming Stone and open the path back to the stone builders, the Cad a Hoi. But would those who inherited the quest understand it  The Baron Moncrieff thought he did but it robbed him of his reputation, health and finally his life. It led him to ever more desperate treks into the high places of the world, searching for &quot;The bright shining hills&quot;. But no one believed his mystic ramblings and within a few years of his last journey he was dead. Now the dream passed to his grandson, Thomas. He too would begin to seek answers to the mystery. With the aid of his friend, Lumpy, he would search in secret for the two warriors locked in a stone. He had read the Prophecy and seen the first glimmers of its truth. So armed only with his love of the old man and the need to understand his own dream he too would keep faith and await the Messiahs." />
