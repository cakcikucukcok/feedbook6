  <title>Railroad Rising - J.P. Wagner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Gunpowder magic, steam-power, adventure, and intrigue...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Carrtog, landless third son of Tsingallik and warrior trained in the use of powder magic, intends to make his way as a mercenary for hire. On his travels north, he and his personal guardsman stumble upon the royal christening of an expansion to Cragmor&amp;#39;s burgeoning railway -- in this case a gift from the King as a sign of goodwill to the conquered north of old. When the gathered populace prove they are not there to be pacified, Carrtog isn&amp;#39;t about to standby and do nothing. Cloaks sweep back, swords and pistols are drawn. Luckily for Carrtog, charging in might be his best chance of earning a name. But then the trap springs around the royal party and Carrtog realizes his eagerness may lead to his demise.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Worse, if he manages to survive the ensorcelled contraption and rescue the King from the depths of the rebellious north, he might find that holding the King&amp;#39;s favor could prove more dangerous than any duel against a combat magician in the haze of battlefield smoke. He&amp;#39;ll need more than a little wit and inventiveness to survive this uprising." />
