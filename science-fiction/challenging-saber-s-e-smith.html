  <title>Challenging Saber - S.E. Smith</title>
      <meta name="description" content="USA Today Bestseller!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To wake the beast inside him&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Saber fears he will never fully recover from his debilitating injury, and if he cannot protect his Amate, he knows he doesn&amp;rsquo;t deserve her. She should choose a warrior, not a cripple who will need her constant help, so Saber does everything in his power to push away the delicate human he has fallen in love with.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Taylor Sampson may be human, but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t make her weak. She and her sisters survived four years on Earth&amp;rsquo;s violent streets after the Alliance made first contact. She was a teenager then, but she is all grown up now, and she has her eye on the Trivator who captured her heart seven years ago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Taylor has one last assignment on another planet in order to complete her schooling. Once she finishes, she plans to show Saber that he is the man she wants, stubbornness and all, but when civil war erupts, she is trapped behind enemy lines. It isn&amp;rsquo;t long before Saber discovers that Taylor has been left behind, and suddenly there&amp;rsquo;s no room in his life for pity, not for himself, or anyone who gets in his way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Internationally acclaimed S.E. Smith presents a new action-packed story full of adventure and romance. Brimming with her signature humor, vivid landscapes, and beloved characters, this book is sure to be another fan-favorite!&lt;br /&gt;
