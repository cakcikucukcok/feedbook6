  <title>A Day in the Life - William T. Wilhite</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Day in the Life is the story of a half-human little girl who has a day of all days. The story begins in a jungle far, far from her home planet of Hetrae on the planet Saduje. Elbib, her brother Yloh, and her twin ten-year-old brother and her sister were in the southern region of the planet, much like the Amazon on earth. Cifus, the Karrponian, attacks the children and takes Yloh prisoner after he allows her and the twins to escape. This starts a day that keeps getting worse. Soon her parents, grandparents, uncle, and cousin were caught up in the terrible day. The quest for the Glencarin Crystal begins, and there are many helping the family, including a group of intergalactic warriors known as Defenders, Eedeed from Sky City; Teetee the Sky Elf; Lem, Asil, and Tirips from the village of Dynas; and the Landosian family, Chas, Jade, Eisus, and Ettenot. In one day, Elbib fights for her life, as well as her twin siblings and Yloh many times. Finally, after a day, the crystal is secured by the coalition, but something unexpected happened when Mada and Eve touched the crystal together. Thus begins the next adventureThe Crystal and the Gem: The Fight between Light and Darkness." />
