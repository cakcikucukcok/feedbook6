  <title>Salisby Dalisby&#39;s Vast Cavern Worlds - VICTOR C FUNK</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Salsiby Dalisby has been lead by three new Sanciant Ladies to a cave entrance opening on the huge rock surface, after agreeing to leave the surface of the first giant rock that had been made by Salisby&amp;#39;s tenth Sanctiant order. &amp;nbsp;Salisby soon finds himself at the end of the long cave tunnel at a opening that again comes out of the interior of a huge open vast cavern. &amp;nbsp;The view from the cave into the cavern is as panoramic and spectacular as anyone could imagine. There is a very light blue sky that does not reveal what is beyond the eyesight of all of the Sanctiants and other univited visitors that eventually come to see what all of the excitement was about. The new always lighted&amp;nbsp;envirement was very hostile for the frail reptilian intruders. &amp;nbsp;However, all of the Sanctiants living in the new vast cavern world were again finding happiness again by having&amp;nbsp;a very quiet and peaceful world to live in. &amp;nbsp;As the huge rock cooled down more and more univited dark lords starting sending their troops to spy and harass the Sanctiant families living there. Some very unpleasant events occure on the exterior of the first rock of Dalisby that would later cause the Sanctiant Salisby Dalisby to become much more determined to get rid of the culprits that were making things worse for all of the Sanctiant families.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
