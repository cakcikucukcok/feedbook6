  <title>The Enlightened - Js Joubert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Your kind left us out here to die, but we survived. You invade our sanctuaries and defile our sacred grounds. You capture us for your studies, and you have the audacity to want to drink from the source of the birth stone. You shall be judged.
After the atrocities of the war of Sargon and the devastation humankind brought on Edin, humanity was on the brink of annihilation. The governments of the world formed the United Coalition of Governments as a beacon of light in the darkness. One visionary realised that this fragile truce was not enough to save humanity from itself.
The Corporation came into being, a society kept apart from the world of greed and corruption. Using their superior technology, they fight to save humankind from destruction. But outside the protection of the Corporations domed cities, there is a new threat lurking deep within the desert caverns, clawing its way to the surface.
In the midst of distrust, the truce of the Coalition is on the verge of a breakdown. The current steward of the Corporation knows there is only one option left to save humanity. He must break all the principles and ideals on which the Corporation was founded, but will it be enough?
