  <title>Lone Star Planet - H. Beam Piper</title>
      <meta name="description" content="They started giving me the business as soon as I came through the door into the Secretary&amp;#39;s outer office.&lt;br /&gt;
There was Ethel K&amp;#39;wang-Li, the Secretary&amp;#39;s receptionist, at her desk. There was Courtlant Staynes, the assistant secretary to the Undersecretary for Economic Penetration, and Norman Gazarin, from Protocol, and Toby Lawder, from Humanoid Peoples&amp;#39; Affairs, and Raoul Chavier, and Hans Mannteufel, and Olga Reznik.&lt;br /&gt;
It was a wonder there weren&amp;#39;t more of them watching the condemned man&amp;#39;s march to the gibbet: the word that the Secretary had called me in must have gotten all over the Department since the offices had opened.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Ah, Mr. Machiavelli, I presume,&amp;quot; Ethel kicked off.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Machiavelli, Junior.&amp;quot; Olga picked up the ball. &amp;quot;At least, that&amp;#39;s the way he signs it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;God&amp;#39;s gift to the Consular Service, and the Consular Service&amp;#39;s gift to Policy Planning,&amp;quot; Gazarin added.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Take it easy, folks. These Hooligan Diplomats would as soon shoot you as look at you,&amp;quot; Mannteufel warned.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Be sure and tell the Secretary that your friends all want important posts in the Galactic Empire.&amp;quot; Olga again.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well, I&amp;#39;m glad some of you could read it,&amp;quot; I fired back. &amp;quot;Maybe even a few of you understood what it was all about.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry, Silk,&amp;quot; Gazarin told me. &amp;quot;Secretary Ghopal understands what it was all about. All too well, you&amp;#39;ll find.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
A buzzer sounded gently on Ethel K&amp;#39;wang-Li&amp;#39;s desk. She snatched up the handphone and whispered into it. A deathly silence filled the room while she listened, whispered some more, then hung it up.&lt;br /&gt;
They were all staring at me.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Secretary Ghopal is ready to see Mr. Stephen Silk,&amp;quot; she said. &amp;quot;This way, please.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
As I started across the room, Staynes began drumming on the top of the desk with his fingers, the slow reiterated rhythm to which a man marches to a military execution.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A cigarette?&amp;quot; Lawder inquired tonelessly. &amp;quot;A glass of rum?&amp;quot;" />
