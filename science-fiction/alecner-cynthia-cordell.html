  <title>Alecner - Cynthia Cordell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Of all the planets orbiting Alpha Centauri, Alecner is the most notorious for its seedy drug culture. As a boy, Chancellor Riley Sinclaire bore witness to his grandmothers decline under the influence of narcotics. For that Sinclaire wanted revenge. In four days, Sinclaires plans would come to fruition, and the planet, along with its criminal populace, would be ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he stands before the monorail on the planet Voltaire, Sinclaire spies a remarkably beautiful woman with exquisite fashion sense and features. Smitten, he takes the woman, Eden, to lunchand, despite learning that she hails from Alecner, Sinclaire begins to fall in love. His newfound passion for Eden tempers his hatred for Alecner, and he decides to cleanse the planet rather than simply destroy it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this romance ignites, the flames of an old rivalry are fanned. Edens nemesis, Vexa, has her heart set on Sinclaire as well. Where Eden is kind and caring, Vexa is militaristic, cold, and calculating; shell stop at nothing to get what she wants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Important to them both as he is, love is not the only thing on the table in this showdown. Virtual immortality is at stake, as Sinclaire tries to choose a new voice for the ubiquitous computer. As tensions between Eden and Vexa increase, things become violent. Will Riley Sinclaire have a chance to choose his lover and the new voice for his technologically advanced ubiquitous computer system, or will both fall to the last woman standing?&lt;/p&gt;" />
