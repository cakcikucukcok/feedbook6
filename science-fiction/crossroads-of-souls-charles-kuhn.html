  <title>Crossroads of Souls - Charles Kuhn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The sentries watch and record each new incident, growing more haggard event by event, but never tiring of the dramas that unfold so characters can reach a greater understanding of themselves through each harrowing event.
At Crossroads, an emotionally complex vision of real-world events and feelings are cast in mystery and brought to life through period antiques found there. Each event manifested from the period piece leads the character into a deep chasm of discovery brought on by that single piece of antiquity that calls to them from their past.
For Calvin Johnson, a Southern redneck, his reformation began when he picks up an old toy tractor that reminds him of his childhood. In the hour that follows, his present-day belligerence and disdain for existing social norms are permanently altered. The sole witness to this epiphany is a strange old womansilent yet wise, kind yet cruelharbored in this ancient location, kept company only by the sentries at the Crossroads. 
Graces resurrection from an out-of-control gambler begins as a mad dash through the junk store with her best friend, Theresa. Their goal is to find the most outrageous trinket possible. Grace is sure she won. She has, but not by finding the most outrageous trinket. Chriss metamorphosis from a man of handicap to one of health, who in turns wields out handicap, begins when he finds an old walking stick. He leaves the store with that stick and an appreciation for so much more. Rutherfords awakening to the harsh reality of bigotry comes in the color of another mans skin. The temptress of bigotry is known to him, but after his experience, he knows it will never suck him in again. Janettes acknowledgement of the person she has become comes to her upon the death of her alter consciousness. 
She realizes it is the death of her alter ego and vows to change her ways to avoid this reality in her everyday life. The strength of family is revealed to Alex during the hell of war and survival. Family will never be shirked again in his life. Joseph finds an inner strength to persevere only to have it ripped from his fingers. His appreciation of inner strength, leadership, and accomplishment will never be the same. Lisa discovers unknown truths that shatter her beliefs in the world she so carefully construes. It defies her logic, but makes her understand what a pupil on the world stage she was. Rod finds the euphoria of his past only to have it stripped away. He comes to realize that some things never change. Wayne rediscovers integrity to guide him on a straighter path. He realizes he never should have left it behind.
Through it all, the caretaker observes, watching each and every stage play evolve before her. She does not participate, only witnesses the harrowing events that changes each character forever. Her only comrades are the sentries that stand guard in the blazing sun at the Crossroads. 	She knows the stories of the items she watches over. She observes the reactions of each character that become bound to her charges. She possesses the knowledge to understand. Each event unfolds with difference before her. Boredom never comes to visit her or the sentries. They wait patiently and know that a new event will unfold before them soon.
New people that visit the old store usually leave with a useless item of antiquity. All leave with a new understanding of their life. The old woman watches as they depart with their worthless trinkets. And she wonders if the true lesson learned at the Crossroads will stay with them longer." />
