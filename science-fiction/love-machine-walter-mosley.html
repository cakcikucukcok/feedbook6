  <title>Love Machine - Walter Mosley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Walter Mosley&#39;s talent knows no bounds. &lt;i&gt;Stepping Stone&lt;/i&gt; is one of six fragments in the &lt;i&gt;Crosstown to Oblivion&lt;/i&gt; short novels in which Mosley entertainingly explores life&#39;s cosmic questions. From life&#39;s meaning to the nature of good and evil, these tales take us on speculative journeys beyond the reality we have come to know. In each tale someone in our world today is given insight into these long pondered mysteries. But how would the world really receive the answers? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Stepping Stone&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Truman Pope has spent his whole life watching the world go by-and waiting for something he can&#39;t quite put into words.  A gentle, unassuming soul, he has worked in the mailroom of a large corporation for decades without making waves, until the day he spots a mysterious woman in yellow.  A woman nobody else can see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon Truman&#39;s quiet life begins to turn upside-down.  An old lover surfaces from his past even as he finds his job in jeopardy.  Strange visions haunt his days and nights, until he begins to doubt his sanity.  Is he losing his mind, or is he on the brink of a startling revelation that will change his life forever-and transform the nature of humanity?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
