  <title>Awakening of the Gods - Timothy Ray Keen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Hollister rejoins her family after several years of post-doctoral research in Germany, only to find herself embroiled in a desperate plan to save the world from destruction. Her homecoming is not what she expected when she learns the truth about herself, her family and her people. As her part in the plot becomes more perilous, she discovers that the people of earth are more alike than she had imagined.&lt;br /&gt;
The people of earth find they have a powerful ally in their efforts, but one who remains hidden even while acting recklessly. Can they trust this unknown partner, who has no consideration for human life? While completing the defensive system before time is up, billions die and Elizabeth finds that her people are changing. They suspect that their unseen ally may be using them to accomplish its own purpose and they are facing a dilemma as the world becomes ready to protect itself; should they get ready for conflict with their former ally? Nothing could have prepared them for what will be unveiled when their unseen ally shows itself.&lt;br /&gt;
