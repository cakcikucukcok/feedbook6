  <title>The Golden Age of Weird Fiction MEGAPACK ?, Vol. 5: David H. Keller - David H. Keller</title>
      <meta name="description" content="David H. Keller, M.D. (1880-1966) was indeed a medical doctor (a psychiatrist -- and the first to write science fiction). He was an early proponent of H.P. Lovecraft and wrote a number of articles on Lovecraft&#39;s work, whose influence can be seen in some of his horror stories. Another influence was James Branch Cabell. This volume concentrates on Keller&#39;s fantasy and horror, but does include -- at the end of the book -- a few science-fiction and science-fantasy works which we obtained to late to include in the (already published) Golden Age of Science Fiction volume of his work. Included here are: THE JELLY-FISH THE WORM THE BONELESS HORROR A PIECE OF LINOLEUM THE GOLDEN BOUGH THE DEAD WOMAN THE DOORBELL TIGER CAT THE THIRTY AND ONE HEREDITY THE FACE IN THE MIRROR THE GOLDEN KEY STENOGRAPHER&#39;S HANDS WHITE COLLARS THE CEREBRAL LIBRARY UNTO US A CHILD IS BORN LIFE EVERLASTING A note to the sensitive: As with many pulp writers, especially those born in the 19th Century, his works are not always politically correct by today&#39;s standards.
