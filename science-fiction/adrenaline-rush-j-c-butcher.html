  <title>Adrenaline Rush - J.C. Butcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The world is dying. In an alternate universe where the British-founded Itherian empire is the worlds dominating power, anyone not of pure Itherian blood is shunned and forced to live in poverty-stricken mega-cities called Shenis that only exist to provide power and comfort to the wealthy Plessy cities. All of which is enforced by the Govenrments super-soldier program, known as: Valkyrie.   
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Vincent Faust the Third, a child-billionaire of Itherian blood whos the heir to the Technological-security mega-giant T.R.U.S.T has his life turned upside-down when his uncle Salvador incites a corporate-takeover and assassinates his father and mother, forcing the young boy to flee into the cold, harsh Sheni streets. After struggling to survive with his little brother in such a strange new world, Vincent meets Chris, a member of an anti-government mercenary organization known as TFA who takes him under his wing and trains him to gain the power needed to take on an empire.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
With the government hunting him, and his old life gone, Vincents first chapter begins with vengeance against an oppressive regime and the family that betrayed him but will he survive long enough to even see the beginning of the coming war?" />
