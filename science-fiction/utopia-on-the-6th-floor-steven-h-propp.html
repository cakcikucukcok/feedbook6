  <title>Utopia on the 6Th Floor - Steven H. Propp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Can you create an ideal world of your own? A utopia?&lt;/p&gt;
In 2022, the administration and staff of the University of Northern California think so; that&#39;s why they&#39;ve created a cozy little campus in the hills of Placerville, secure (behind thick concrete walls) from the social chaos that prevails in the larger society. Here, they can devote themselves wholly to the life of the mind. &lt;/p&gt;
However, problems soon appear: &quot;Generation Z&quot; students chafe under the campus restrictions (including mandatory use of sexual suppressant drugs), and begin an &quot;Underground&quot; movement of protest. History Professor Morton Thompson finds himself in the middle, as well as coping with violent attacks on the campus. &lt;/p&gt;
A quasi-governmental agency called UniCom (creators of a database called &quot;The BEAST&quot; that is a terrifying violation of civil liberties) enters the picture, determined to use the situation for its own ends, leading to a thrilling and unexpected climax. &lt;/p&gt;
Discover the difficulties in trying to flee from the problems of the world, as Professor Thompson and others await the appearance of the mysterious &quot;Generation A&quot;  &lt;/p&gt;
Eight lectures: The core of Professor Thompson&#39;s course in American Utopian Communities, are also appended, presenting an outline of the history of &quot;utopian&quot;/intentional communities in this country." />
