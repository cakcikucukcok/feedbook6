  <title>Half a Rune - Cary A. Conder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Born during a period of insurrection on the world, Fimiah Hafrin is found by a wandering Hynarkin trader, Marrek Lytsun.  Marrek leaves him with friends, Zivvoz and Kili to be raised.  But in his tenth year, during a squabble with his brother, Indoro, Hafrin finds out he is not related to Zivvoz and his family.  Although no one will tell him who precisely he is, Marrek takes Hafrin home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At fifteenth Hafrin makes a two-fold discovery: that he is Royalty, the Alaiad Presumptive.  And Marrek and the other Hynarkin are not native to Fimiah.  Hafrin&#39;s people are caught up in an interstellar war between the Hynarkin and their allies and another alien race.  While Hafrin comes to terms with what his future may hold, they play a deadly waiting game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two years later he meets and falls in love with a Hynarkin woman.  Nichole discovers Hafrin is, like herself a telepath.  Under her guidance he learns something of what it means to possess psi talents.  But Nichole&#39;s destiny is not on Fimiah and the young couple is forcibly separated.&lt;/p&gt;" />
