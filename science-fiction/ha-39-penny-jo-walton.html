  <title>Ha&#39;penny - Jo Walton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In 1949, eight years after the &quot;Peace with Honor&quot; was negotiated between Great Britain and Nazi Germany by the Farthing Set, England has completed its slide into fascist dicatorship. Then a bomb explodes in a London suburb. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brilliant but politically compromised Inspector Carmichael of Scotland Yard is assigned the case. What he finds leads him to a conspiracy of peers and communists, of staunch King-and- Country patriots and hardened IRA gunmen, to murder Britain&#39;s Prime Minister and his new ally, Adolf Hitler. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against a background of increasing domestic espionage and the suppression of Jews and homosexuals, an ad-hoc band of idealists and conservatives blackmail the one person they need to complete their plot, an actress who lives for her art and holds the key to the Fuhrer&#39;s death. From the ha&#39;penny seats in the theatre to the ha&#39;pennies that cover dead men&#39;s eyes, the conspiracy and the investigation swirl around one another, spinning beyond anyone&#39;s control. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this brilliant companion to Farthing, Welsh-born World Fantasy Award winner Jo Walton continues her alternate history of an England that could have been, with a novel that is both an homage of the classic detective novels of the thirties and forties, and an allegory of the world we live in today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
