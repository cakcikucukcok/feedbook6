  <title>First-Person Singularities - Robert Silverberg, John Scalzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;First-Person Singularities&lt;/b&gt;, stories by science fiction Grand Master &lt;b&gt;Robert Silverberg&lt;/b&gt;, features eighteen tales written over the course of his forty-year career, all told in the first-person singular. Inspired by W. Somerset Maugham’s Six Stories Written in the First Person Singular, a fiercely realist collection from the 1930s, Silverberg takes on the challenge, offering up his own unique sci-fi twist and “running the gambit of singularity.” 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Every story in &lt;b&gt;First-Person Singularities&lt;/b&gt; offers a one-of-a-kind narrator: a dolphin feeling the pangs of love for a human being; a computer eager to convince us of its sanity; a Greek god who has surreptitiously survived into modern times; an alien visitor living in disguise in a New York City hotel. Even a pudgy, timid Henry James gets the Silverberg treatment as the witness/narrator of H.G. Wells’s The War of the Worlds! Each story features a special introduction by Silverberg himself, providing the inside scoop on his experience writing for and publishing with the greatest science fiction magazines of the past and present. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;First-Person Singularities&lt;/b&gt; includes an introduction by Hugo-award winning sci-fi author John Scalzi (&lt;i&gt;Redshirts&lt;/i&gt;).
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Robert Silverberg&lt;/b&gt; is one of the giants of the sci-fi genre, with four Hugo Awards and six Nebula Awards to his name. He was inducted into the Science Fiction and Fantasy Hall of Fame in 1999 and named a Grand Master by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America in 2005." />
