  <title>Charisma - Steven Barnes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It began well - an experiment in techniques to teach high-risk children - poor, minority, children - the life-strategies that will allow them to succeed in life.  And not just succeed, but overcome the odds and become wildly successful.  They chose as their model a man who had done it all - Alexander Marcus;  a black man who raised himself up from poverty to become one of the wealthiest, most powerful men in America.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The imprinting is effective.  The children are focused, driven. They are inventive, intelligent, and love learning.   But there is a mysterious darkness to them - a ruthlessness that is surprising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renny Sand first met the children as a journalist covering the sensational trial of a preschool operator.  There were terrible charges of sex abuse, but the thing that stayed with Renny was the strange poise and power of a group of eight year old children.  That, and the face of the mother of one of them, Vivian Emory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the children are thirteen years old, and one of them has been killed in a mysterious hit-and-run accident.  Renny Sands sees the possibility of big story, a human interest story, a story that might jump-start his flagging career.  He&#39;ll do a follow-up on the preschool scandal; and he might get a chance to restart his love life as well - Vivian Emory has divorced her husband in the five years since he met her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
