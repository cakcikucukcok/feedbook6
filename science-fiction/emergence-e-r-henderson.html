  <title>Emergence - E. R. Henderson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The &#39;could be true&#39; story of creation, evolution and the meaning of life. It takes place over four billion years, moves through current time and into the not too distant future. The &quot;Original Six Creators&quot; are second-generation beings that are responsible for the Universe, as we know it. Periodically they train additional generations of Creators who are then licensed to travel the time-space continuum and establish new creations in the Multiverse. It is during this program of Creator training that a trainee sabotages a brilliant colleague and the consequences are catastrophic for their experiment, which happens to be a planet we call Earth. The appearance of a mysterious third generation Creator opens the door to unprecedented issues amongst the existing Creators as he develops his own program for training of future Creators. Interwoven in the story are important philosophical and cultural concepts that are very relevant to our current situation." />
