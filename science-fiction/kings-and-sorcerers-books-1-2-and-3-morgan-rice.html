  <title>Kings and Sorcerers (Books 1, 2, and 3) - Morgan Rice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;An action packed fantasy sure to please fans of Morgan Rice&#39;s previous novels, along with fans of works such as The Inheritance Cycle by Christopher Paolini.... Fans of Young Adult Fiction will devour this latest work by Rice and beg for more.&quot;&lt;p&gt;--The Wanderer, A Literary Journal (regarding Rise of the Dragons) &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The #1 Bestselling series! &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bundle of the first three books in Morgan Rice&#39;s #1 Bestselling fantasy series KINGS AND SORCERERS (RISE OF THE DRAGONS, RISE OF THE VALIANT and THE WEIGHT OF HONOR). Here are three bestselling novels, all in one convenient file, which offer a great introduction to the KINGS AND SORCERERS series. Over 200,000 words of reading, all for an incredible price-a great deal, it also makes the perfect gift! &lt;p&gt;KINGS AND SORCERERS tells the epic coming of age story of Kyra, 15, who dreams of becoming a famed warrior, like her father, though she is the only girl in a fort of boys. She struggles to understand her special skills and mysterious inner power, and comes to realize she is different than the others. But a secret is being kept from her about her birth and the prophecy surrounding her, leaving her only to wonder. When Kyra comes of age and her father tries to wed her off, she refuses and journeys out on her own, into a dangerous wood, where she encounters a wounded dragon-and ignites a series of events that will change the kingdom forever. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its strong atmosphere and complex characters, KINGS AND SORCERERS is a sweeping saga of knights and warriors, of kings and lords, of honor and valor, of magic, destiny, monsters and dragons. It is a story of love and broken hearts, of deception, ambition and betrayal. It is fantasy at its finest, inviting us into a world that will live with us forever, one that will appeal to all ages and genders. &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;If you thought that there was no reason left for living after the end of the Sorcerer&#39;s Ring series, you were wrong. Morgan Rice has come up with what promises to be another brilliant series, immersing us in a fantasy of trolls and dragons, of valor, honor, courage, magic and faith in your destiny. Morgan has managed again to produce a strong set of characters that make us cheer for them on every page....Recommended for the permanent library of all readers that love a well-written fantasy.&quot; &lt;p&gt;--Books and Movie Reviews, Roberto Mattos (regarding Rise of the Dragons) &lt;p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &quot;[The novel] succeeds-right from the start.... A superior fantasy...It begins, as it should, with one protagonist&#39;s struggles and moves neatly into a wider circle of knights, dragons, magic and monsters, and destiny....All the trappings of high fantasy are here, from soldiers and battles to confrontations with self....A recommended winner for any who enjoy epic fantasy writing fueled by powerful, believable young adult protagonists.&quot; &lt;p&gt;--Midwest Book Review, D. Donovan, eBook Reviewer (regarding Rise of the Dragons)" />
