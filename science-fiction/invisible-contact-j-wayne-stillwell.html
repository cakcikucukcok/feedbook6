  <title>Invisible Contact - J. Wayne Stillwell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In approximately 4300 BC, God destroyed most of the life on the planet in a great flood. Many think the next equivalent event will be Armageddon. But what if something profound happens, an event that would give mankind a chance to restore Gods faith in his creation and delay Armageddon. 
In Earth, year 1943, a scientific exploration ship from an advanced alien empire was halfway through a ten-year survey of the Orion-Cygnus Arm of the Milky Way. The aliens were suffering with severe over population and needed to increase their real estate holdings. They were ecstatic when they discovered Earth. They built a covert operating base in the South Pacific Ocean and began the construction of a mega space craft capable of moving earth to their solar system. 
In the summer of 2027, a freak storm blew a ship heading for Pitcairn Island in French Polynesia onto an invisible island. The volunteer archeological dig team on board soon discovered that time and distance were relative, that the laws of physics extended far beyond what Newton and Einstein could imagine, and that humans were not alone in the universe." />
