  <title>Beast Master&#39;s Quest - André Norton, Lyn McConchie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Laris is a young orphaned ex-refugee gifted with the beast master ability allowing her to communicate with animals. Her closest companion is a remarkably intelligent and mysterious cat-like creature named Prauo, whose origin is shrouded in mystery. Laris, having made a home for herself with the Quades, a family of Arzor ranchers, also has become friends with beast masters Tani and Hosteen Storm, who help her develop her beast master skills. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Laris inherits a spaceship from a distant relative, she realizes that she might now fulfill her dream of finding Prauo&#39;s home planet. But it won&#39;t be easy, and she is relieved when she is able to convince her new extended family to embark with her on a journey into the unknown depths of space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Laris and her friends find in space, however, tests their beast master abilities and threatens their lives. Prauo&#39;s homeworld is beset by dangers the intrepid travelers could not have anticipated. It will take all of their talents and experience to get back to Arzor alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
