      <meta name="description" content="Earth is no longer a refuge for humans.  They are scattered across space and play a pivotal role in the future for all in the universe.  Factions war for power and the battle over planets will lead to the death and destruction of whole colonies.  
The fate of worlds will be determined by the major players and the most unlikely allies.  Cole is an assassin who has almost forgotten what it meant to be free.  David is a twelve year old boy who never had a childhood and has been trained as a killer.  Eric is a spy who has put on so many faces he can barely recall which one is his.  Alanna is a Vampyre who once called Earth her home before she was cast into a battle she never wanted, and Neeto is a teenager who was genetically altered to be one of the most powerful beings ever created.
They, together with others, may just have a chance to make a difference." />
