  <title>The Traveler - Jenna Lindsey</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What if a daydream became an alternate reality? What if that reality became a nightmare?&lt;p&gt;
&quot;Travelers,&quot; Ninehtah said at last, &quot;create bridges between worlds; bridges of time which we cross when our next lifetime is fully formed. As we become incompatible with one world, we split apart and then gradually become whole.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;What went wrong?&quot; asked Jinnie.&lt;p&gt;
In, The Traveler, Jinnie is magically transported to Ispell, to the other half of a dual existence and to the real love of Griffin. Her memory of her life on Earth, however, is as absent as her memory of her life on Ispell. She feels like an actor in a play who knows the story, but has forgotten the lines.&lt;p&gt;
Without warning, Jinnie is pulled to a new life on a different world. Haunted by dreams of Griffin, Jinnie regains her memory only to be pulled even further away from the life and love she desires. Resolving to understand what&#39;s happening to her and why, Jinnie finally discovers the horrible truth behind her strange existence, and the wrenching emptiness underlying the words, &quot;I love you.&quot;" />
