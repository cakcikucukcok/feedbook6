  <title>Battle for Earth 2012 - William Jordan Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The year is 2062; it has been fifty years since the Great War broke out. Looking back now, its kind of funny in a way when you think of it. At the time of 2012, the governments of the world, as well as the science committees, were all transfixed and worried about the way the earth would be affected by the solar lineup of the planets.
There were all kinds of theories and speculations on how and what would happen. But by no means was anyone prepared for what really happened. When everything lined up as predicted by the long calendar of the Mayans, it was not a global attack by Mother Nature. The poles did not reverse as so many believed it would. No, in fact it was a doorway opening to an all-out attack by an ailing race of beings bent on raping the earth of her resources and the enslaving of all mankind.
It was a repeat of what happened long ago; as it was with the people of Atlantis, so it is with us. We find ourselves locked in combat for our lives, our very existence." />
