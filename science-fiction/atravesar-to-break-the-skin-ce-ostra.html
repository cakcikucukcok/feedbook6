  <title>Atravesar - To Break the Skin - Ce Ostra</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Celan Mairs, now 18 years old and known as Lana Timanti, has been raised to be a model citizen of Albakirk - ever since she left her home in the ranchos and was discovered by her father, Theodore, at age 11. As she strives to win a coveted spot as a SocEn trainee, she is forced to cope with some unexpected emotional fallout that threatens to derail her efforts. Meanwhile, Theodore is focused on his own goal: Gathering the support needed to make Albakirk the first city-state on a long-ruined Earth to establish a permanent colony on Mars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But her father&amp;rsquo;s fellow Lead SocEn, Ariana Balor, has other plans. Under the the guise of cleansing the planet, she hopes to rid Albakirk of the influence of Transway - that place outside the city walls where ranchos refugees grow ever more entrenched in a mysterious drug culture that she feels is detrimental to the health of the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter Lang Shays - a young man whose pure metaphysical talents belie a fissure of shadow, and who will end up changing the course of all of their lives.&lt;/p&gt;" />
