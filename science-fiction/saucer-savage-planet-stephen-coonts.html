The recovery is funded by a pharmaceutical executive who believes that the saucer holds the key to an anti-aging drug formula that space travelers would need to voyage between galaxies.  But one of his technicians, Adam Solo, an alien marooned on Earth for a thousand years, steals the saucer, hoping to summon a starship to rescue him.  Unfortunately, the stolen saucer has damaged communications gear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solo goes to Rip Cantrell and his partner, ex-Air Force test pilot Charlotte &quot;Charley&quot; Pine, and Rip&#39;s uncle Egg, for help in summoning a starship.  Meanwhile, as a terrified world fearful of space invaders approaches meltdown, big pharma moguls and their thugs are hot on the trail of the foursome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world turned upside down, it may be the arriving aliens who offer limitless possibilities. Rip and Charley face an incredible decision: Do they dare leave the safety of earth to travel into the great wilderness of the universe?&lt;/p&gt;" />
