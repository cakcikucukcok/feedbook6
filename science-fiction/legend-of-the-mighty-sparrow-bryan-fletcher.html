  <title>Legend of the Mighty Sparrow - Bryan Fletcher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Bonnies greatest fears have come true: unemployed, homeless, bankrupt, as well as alienated from family and friends.
In a desperate effort to salvage her life, she flees California in search of long-lost New York girlfriends.
However, she soon discovers them trapped in a complex real -estate scam, as one of them purchased a rundown Gilded Age mansion at the edge of a remote as well as fiercely disputed forest, a place with a reputation; people enter and mysteriously return unfit to live.
Unknown to them, this remote forest represents a truly great real-world experiment of the bizarre and grotesque, a neologic syncretism, a frontier without pesky checks and balances, the darker side of free enterprise, the side of obsession and addiction, a brave new world, and a place controlled by powerful special interests too big to fail, controlled by the ultimate insiders, who seem hell bent on a leap fifty years ahead of the competition, in search of pure profit and tremendous control over the world economic system.
So they obsessively tinker with nature and ignore the fundamental rules, a tyranny of small decisions, and this great experiment goes wrong, and these ultimate insiders create a magnificent freak, a true techno glory, and yet a serious affront to nature, a gross mockery of nature law, as well as sick abomination associated with a dystopia, and creature or thing far ahead of everyone, beyond foresight, and before black site powers-that-be realize the full potential and implications, and the device gains control over the creator." />
