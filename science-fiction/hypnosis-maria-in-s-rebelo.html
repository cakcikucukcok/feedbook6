However, everything changes when a mysterious woman named Anne Pauline Roux knocks on his door. She holds a rare power when hypnotized, which will affect both their lives in ways they could never imagine. Her unique power is so strong that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t stay secret for long. Marcus&amp;rsquo; archrival and fellow hypnotist, Josef Salvaterra, has been looking for a way to shut down Marcus&amp;rsquo; business for years.
