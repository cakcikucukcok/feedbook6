  <title>Minerva&#39;s Shield - Derek Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The world has come to an end.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Or has it?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What starts out as a long overdue father-and-son vacation immediately becomes more complicated, when they uncover an unusual coin in the dirt.  Frighteningly, its as if the planet is thrown into upheaval over this innocent discovery.  All of a sudden, the FBI shows up at their door asking lots of questions, planting the seeds of paranoia, doubt and worry.  The neighbors start acting strangely, almost on the verge of panic.  The nearby military base is abandoned overnight and the weather has never been so unpredictable.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;As everything falls apart around them, no one is certain what is happening.  There is no cell phone service, no radio or TV, no form of communication whatsoever.  What should the people prepare for - the ever-popular zombie apocalypse, or global economic collapse, another American civil war, nuclear or biological terrorist attack, super volcano or titanic earthquake, planet-wide meteorological disaster, impending asteroid collision, or perhaps an alien invasion from outer space?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While the masses flee in every direction, a small organized group finds refuge in a corporate data bunker, which was once a military facility.  Here, thirty people are thrown together, perhaps by fate or coincidence, they come to wait out the final days, the dreaded apocalypse.  Without warning or explanation, their lives are spared by the power of the mysterious coin  Minervas Shield.  When they emerge from inside the mountain, however, they find a world relatively undamaged.  Yet there is no trace that people ever existed.  There are no bodies, no skeletons, not a single trace.  It is a world without humans.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;This diverse community of survivors quickly bands together to gather supplies and hammer out a new existence, where they appear to be the only living souls.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Still, they are curious about what really happened that fateful day.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;And someone, or something, is watching them as well.&lt;/P&gt;" />
