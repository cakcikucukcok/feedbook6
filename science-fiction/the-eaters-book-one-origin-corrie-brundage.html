  <title>The Eaters: Book One: Origin - Corrie Brundage</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;I&gt;So not your usual post-apocalyptic, clone vs. hybrid romance-adventure&amp;#133;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Brilliant, brave, determined, and just a little bit&amp;#133;distracted.  Meet Dr. Mina Brice, dedicated savior of species, and scientist with a secret. On a planet ravaged by climate change, her ability to mind-meld with earth&amp;#8217;s imperiled beasts has made her a valued member of a team dedicated to saving as many as they can from extinction.  Unfortunately, Mina&amp;#8217;s inability to connect with her fellow humans has kept most of them at arm&#39;s length. Except for Jack&amp;#151;handsome, dashing-with-a-touch -of-goofy, totally distracting Jack. Dr. Jack MacConnell was never supposed to be part of Mina&amp;#8217;s game plan.  But when thrown together on a crazy-dangerous mission, both fate and a deadly tsunami seem determined to propel them down the same fraught&amp;#151;and occasionally delicious&amp;#151;path. Perhaps forever?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But forever turns out to be a fluid commodity when both awaken 500 years into the future in a city called Origin. Presided over by aliens known as The Travelers, it is a world at once familiar and totally strange. And for Mina and Jack, it will become a battleground&amp;#133;against a hybrid race of predators loosed on the human population, against those whose dark side is so very carefully hidden,  and even, as fate throws a heart wrenching twist their way, against&amp;#133;each other?&lt;br&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Corrie Brundage kicks off &lt;I&gt;The Eaters&lt;/I&gt; trilogy with an intoxicating tale of pulse-pounding action for fans of urban fantasy and science fiction to devour and savor.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
