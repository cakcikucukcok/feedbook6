  <title>Spirits of the Coastals - Evelyn Moores</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Spirits of the Coastals is a dystopia novel that takes place in a time when there are few resources, countless diseases, poisonous waters, a deadly, infiltrating sun and a massive upheaval in climate. The story is told through the life experience of a woman who is a member of the Mountain People, one of a few diminutive tribes that gather in a small semi-inhabitable region. It presents binding and oppressive traditions and delicate interactions between Peoples and a harsh environment. The world, as they know it, is amidst the most cataclysmic storm season they can recall. The Mountain People for the most part, have been spared the natural disasters that have befallen their neighbours. However, the storms have served to challenge both the landscape as well as the traditions of the People.&lt;/p&gt;" />
