  <title>The Day Cometh - Jay Navies</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Zordyn Kenyapha was a child growing up in apartheid era South Africa, white men came and stole his familys land. His father fought back, and died for his resistance. Zordyn never forgot that day, especially since he promised his mother he would eventually become a powerful leader like his father, never turning his back on his African brothers and sisters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zordyn grows into an ambitious man who makes a groundbreaking decision. Hounded by the continued mistreatment of his people, he proposed a self-imposed segregation. The black population will relocate to Mars and build a thriving civilization there. But no man is perfect, and even an honorable leader like Zordyn has his weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This idyllic Martian diaspora causes a spate of increased violence that no one expected, and Zordyn and his followers must now decide if theyve made the right move. In the past, Zordyn has been hopeless in the fight for racial equality, but the whole world may soon learn a lesson that humans need each other to survive, regardless of skin color or creed.&lt;/p&gt;" />
