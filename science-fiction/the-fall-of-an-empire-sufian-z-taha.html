  <title>The Fall of an Empire - Sufian Z. Taha</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The novel took a leap into the future, and through various scenes exposed the appalling conditions of humankind. The people were mired in debt and misery, as they succumbed under the oppressive regimes of the various world governments. The destiny of many nations was doomed by one menacing power. 
However, the deplorable hardship was eventually brought to the attention of God. The cries of the people were eventually heard! The Divine court was not indifferent, and the issue was indeed brought forth. God, then assigned benevolent Tabriel, the protagonist, the task of determining the guilty and bring them to justice. 
Tabriel on his part travelled to Earth and began his investigation, he came across Ibleece, the antagonist. Tabriel then uncovered the mystery behind the Empire of the Money Monopoly. Tabriel found it to be in full control of the affairs of humankind, thus responsible for much of the prevailing mischief. However, the people were unaware! Tabriel concluded that via the formidable deception, practiced by Ibleece, the Empire attained its menacing might. 
Tabriel, nonetheless, decided to confront Ibleece and his Empire. He initiated a battle, sparking a revolution, which toppled the menacing Empire of Ibleece." />
