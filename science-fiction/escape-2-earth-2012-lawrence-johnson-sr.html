  <title>Escape 2 Earth 2012 - Lawrence Johnson Sr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Alien warnings embedded in our crop circles have gone unnoticed, until now. Governments around the globe race against time to evacuate billions of inhabitants from the planet due to the discovery that Earth will be destroyed in the year 2012, a mere eight years away. &lt;/p&gt;
Where would we go? How would we get there? Who would be left behind? And why is one race of aliens plotting to keep us here? &lt;/p&gt;
These are just a few of the questions and obstacles faced on this galactic odyssey by our trio of heroes in &lt;i&gt;Escape 2 Earth&lt;/i&gt;. Matt, Will, and Art are reluctantly drawn into an adventure by a secret alien organization that will unlock the mysteries of Stonehenge, the White Pyramid of China, the Mayan calendar, and the Great Sphinx in a scramble to help save the human race. &lt;/p&gt;
This epic quest for Earth&#39;s survival takes you from the powdery pink morning skies on the planet Lazon to the subterranean cities under planet Vada and the Whistling forest. &lt;/p&gt;
The battle between good and evil that began long ago in a far off galaxy is now being played out with the survival of mankind at stake. This sci-fi story is laced with a touch of telepathy, deception, and a murder or two. Discover the hidden alien base deep in the dark murky depths of the Marinas Trench, watch as the aliens prepare to celebrate at the Festival of Life. Who will survive the race to escape this doomed planet? It is anybody&#39;s guess. Who will Escape to Earth? &lt;/p&gt;" />
