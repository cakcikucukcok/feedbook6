      <meta name="description" content="Today is a special day for Makenna Circe Thesis, and she has decided to go all out. Now that Mack has turned eighteen, she&#39;s determined to show everyone-including her overprotective mother, Cybele-that she is no longer a tomboy and child.   But a night that was supposed to be the best celebration ever turns into a nightmare that breaks her heart and tears Mack&#39;s family apart. The powers that have been dormant in her and her siblings since they were babies have manifested themselves.   The four must now prepare for a life they could not have imagined. They are the Elementals, and the future of the universe resides with them. But they are not alone, and Mack finds herself drawn to a man who could destroy them all before they even have a chance to fight.   The first in the Elemental Thesis series, this fantasy novel follows four special children who are destined for more than they ever dreamed of." />
