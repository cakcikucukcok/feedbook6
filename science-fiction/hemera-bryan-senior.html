United Kingdom (PRWEB) August 14, 2013
A whole new world of discovery and excitement await readers in Bryan Seniors debut book titled Hemera, a mind-expanding science fiction that probes into the chances of extraterrestrial presence in Mars. This utterly engrossing adventure will engage readers as they explore the vastness of the universe, affording an alternative perspective of the possibilities lying within reach of the human psyche.
After gaining her degree, Hemera Booth lands a job as a research assistant to Professor Sean Docherty while working towards her Doctorate Degree in Astrophysics and Particle Theory. The first few years pass without incident. She sailed through her theses with remarkable ease under the guidance of her marginally eccentric mentor and found herself still attached to him and his research institute after eight years.
But one Monday morning in early autumn, things begin to change from being occasionally marginally odd to permanently positively weird. What begins as an independently initiated research explodes into an international joint investigation upon a chance discovery that there is a lot more to the Gale Crater on Mars, particularly Mount Sharp, than ever imagined before.
Readers can find out this small teams intriguing find and why scientists from the world over surge to their laboratory in Hemera, a speculative sci-fi novel that reminds readers that there is more to the universe than our normal senses can detect.
