  <title>Crucible - Nancy Kress</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Nancy Kress made her reputation in the early 90s with her multiple award-winning novella, &quot;Beggars in Spain,&quot; which became the basis for her extremely successful Beggars Trilogy (comprising &lt;i&gt;Beggars in Spain&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Beggars and Choosers&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Beggars Ride&lt;/i&gt;). Since then she has written over a dozen novels, including the well-received &lt;i&gt;Probability Trilogy&lt;/i&gt;, culminating in &lt;i&gt;Probability Space&lt;/i&gt;, which garnered her the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best SF Novel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now comes a brand new science fiction epic. &lt;br&gt;It began with &lt;i&gt;Crossfire&lt;/i&gt;: a far-future novel of planetary colonization and alien first contact. Jake Holman, a man trying to escape a dark past, brought together a diverse group of thousands to settle on a new world. But instead the humans found themselves caught in the crossfire of a galaxy-spanning war between two disparate species: agressive, militaristic humanoids known as Furs and passive, plantlike creatures known as Vines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having cast their lots with the peaceful Vines, humanity faces all-out war against the technologically superior Furs. Our only hope? A virus designed by the Vines to remove all aggressiveness from the Furs. Can it spread fast enough to save not only Holman&#39;s colony, but the rest of humanity? And at what price to the Furs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Driven by strong ideas and deep moral questions, and peopled with real-as-life characters, Crucible shows Kress at the top of her form, amply demonstrating why she has been one of science fiction finest authors of the past twenty years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
