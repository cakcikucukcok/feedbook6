  <title>Research-Proven Best Knowledge Systemic School Reform - Dr. Floyd McDowell, Mr. Ronald Brayman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="RELEVANT VALUE-LADEN QUOTATIONS
    Our nations education decision-makers should put top priority on investment in the human potential of our children and youth as they are one hundred per cent of our future.
      &quot; Any nation that expects to be ignorant and free expects what never was and never will be.&quot;...President Thomas Jefferson
        &quot; One form of insanity is to do the same thing over and over and expect different results.&quot;...Dr. Albert Einstein
         &quot; One very important objective of education is to help our children develop a lifelong love of learning so they will effectively educate themselves throughout their lives.&quot;
         &quot; Human potential, though not readily apparent, is there waiting to be discovered and invited forth.&quot;... Dr. William W. Purkey, Co-Founder of the International Alliance for Invitational Education
           &quot; The four broad goals of education are competency and confidence in personal adequacy, social competency, economic efficiency and civic responsibility.&quot;
            &quot; We learn and retain: 10% of what we see; 15% of what we hear; 20% of what we both see and hear; 40% of what we discuss with others; 80% of what we experience directly or practice; and 90% of what we attempt to teach others.&quot;...National Training Laboratory
    Students  are diverse people to be unfolded by best knowledge educational practices, not things to be molded by superimposed, unconnected, costly, winners-losers, one-size-fits-all  standardized test driven projects.
      To predict students scores on standardized tests, simply check the postal mailing zip code which show the sociio-economic level of their home and communities.&quot;
        Children and others do not care how much we know until they know how much we care.
        &quot; Excellence can be achieved if one: Cares more than others think is wise; Risks more than others think is safe; Dreams more than others think is practical; and expects more than others think is possible.&quot;
          &quot; There are limitations on what we can do alone; There are few, if any, limitations to what we can do together.&quot;
            &quot; Our minds are like parachutes and umbrellas: They won&#39;t work unless open.&quot;
             The height and stability of the pinnacle is directly related to the breadth and strength of the base. 
                Overheard in a teachers lounge: One of my jobs is to help kids keep lids on their ids.
              &quot; The only title in our democracy superior to that of President is the title of Citizen.&quot;...Former Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court" />
