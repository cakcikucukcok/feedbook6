      <meta name="description" content="The evolution of policy in education has been very important in determining the direction and the rate of its spread in Nigeria. As one moves from one area or era to another, weak policy or lack of policy has created unforeseen problems that have had long-lasting consequences that color how much and what type of education was deemed suitable for a milieu. 
A lack of understanding of the role of policy has been responsible for many failed interventions in education. This book traces the evolution of policy and attempts to show the correlation between clearly articulated policies and the suitability of the output of the system to respond to the needs of the society." />
