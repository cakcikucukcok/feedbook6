  <title>What Went Right - Roberta Israeloff, George McDermott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;What Went Right: Lessons from Both Sides of the Teacher&amp;rsquo;s Desk &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;co-authors Roberta Israeloff and George McDermott resume a conversation they began in 1967&amp;mdash;when she was in eleventh grade at Syosset (N.Y.) High School and he was her English teacher. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2014, after finding each other on Facebook, they began an email correspondence&amp;mdash;as contemporaries, rather than student and teacher&amp;mdash;and quickly discovered that neither had ever stopped thinking about that school and the many ways it influenced them. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As they shared their impressions of how and why public education has changed since then, they realized that a single academic year can have a deeper and longer-lasting impact than they had ever imagined. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal and probing, evocative and wide-ranging, the letters that compose this book ask and attempt to answer some timeless&amp;mdash;and timely&amp;mdash;questions: What makes a teacher or a class memorable? How can the teacher-student relationship be supported and strengthened? What does being &amp;ldquo;educated&amp;rdquo; truly mean? And, perhaps most important, what role can free public education play in sustaining our democracy? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
