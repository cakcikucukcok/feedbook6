  <title>Wings of the Heart - Pam Handa nee Kochhar</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The second edition of Wings of the Heart celebrates a kaleidoscope of subjects. The poems in this book are full of varied thoughts. The poet becomes nostalgic, sentimental, emotional, romantic, humorous, philosophical, religious, spiritual, or even personal according to the mood she finds herself in. Once she decides to view life from a particular angle, she quickly transforms herself into the person she wishes to portray. Sometimes she becomes an idealist and dreamer or a lover; sometimes she becomes an exponent of religious and spiritual values. Oftentimes, she plays the part of a cultural ambassador trying to recapture the rich diversity of our world and giving her readers glimpses of the rich customs, traditions, and ways of life of the three countries she has lived and worked in. Though sometimes she also becomes a teary-eyed pessimist, more often than not, she becomes an optimist full of the zest for life. In fact, in each poem, she dons the required robe of a happy, sad, optimistic, pessimistic, loving, caring, philosophical, or dreaming human being with specific thoughts, hopes, dreams, and visions. 
 Pam Handas poems are in the form of traditional verse. They are rhythmic, soulful, and meaningful. They describe a panoramic view of the millions of thoughts, hopes, fears, joys, achievements, failures, despair, dejection, and rejection we as human beings are bound to face in life. In todays crazy commercial world, the poems in this book transport us to the good old days when music, poetry, dance, and drama were the wings of the heart and soul. They will surely touch the hearts of most of you who still maintain a sentimental side to your characters even in todays materialistic world. Readers will surely find these poems close to their hearts. They will not only enjoy reading them but will definitely take home some important lesson." />
