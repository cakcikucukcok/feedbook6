  <title>The Miseducation of the Student Athlete - Kenneth L. Shropshire, Collin D. Williams, Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The student-athlete&amp;#8217;s life: practice, gym, weight room, film review, repeat. Simply put, sports come first. Academics is a distant second.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/i&gt; As the revenues generated by big-time college sports continue to skyrocket, virtually all of the debate involves whether (and how much) student-athletes should be paid for play. Kenneth L. Shropshire and Collin D. Williams, Jr., argue that &amp;#8221;student&amp;#8221; has to come first in student-athlete: the focus should be on prioritizing a &lt;i&gt;meaningful&lt;/i&gt; education.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;The Miseducation of the Student Athlete: How to Fix College Sports,&lt;/i&gt; Shropshire and Williams draw on new research to reveal that it has become increasingly difficult for college athletes to balance school and sports, much less a social life, leading to serious economic, professional, and emotional consequences for young people. Given that fewer than 2% of all college men&amp;#8217;s basketball and football players will play at the professional level, the other 98% of student-athletes must be prepared to find and perform well in jobs outside of their respective field of play.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In this bold call to action, Shropshire and Williams explain how we got here and what can be done about it. They lay out The Student-Athlete Manifesto, a roadmap to increase the likelihood that student-athletes can succeed both on and off the field. They also offer a Meaningful Degree Model, which ensures education pays for everyone, along with stories of success that show it is possible to be both a student and an athlete.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A critical read for student-athletes, sports leadership, policy makers, and anyone who loves college sports, &lt;i&gt;The Miseducation of the Student Athlete&lt;/i&gt; has the potential to disrupt college sport and create lasting change.&lt;/div&gt;" />
