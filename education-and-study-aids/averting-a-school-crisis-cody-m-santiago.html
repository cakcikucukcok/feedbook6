      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;It seems that almost daily we can turn on our televisions or sort through social media and find an incident that happened at a school that caused a disruption. Most people today are only focused on active shooter incidents.

Understanding how to manage your vulnerabilities and putting your staff to use will save time and lives when an emergency occurs. It is up to you to help your school become prepared for its worst day.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Averting a School Crisis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is an excellent resource of knowledge and guidance.
