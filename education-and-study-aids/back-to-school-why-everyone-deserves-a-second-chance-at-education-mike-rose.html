  <title>Back to School: Why Everyone Deserves A Second Chance at Education - Mike Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a statistic that&amp;#8217;s sure to surprise: close to 45 percent of postsecondary students in the United States today do not enroll in college directly out of high school and many attend part-time. Following a tradition of self-improvement as old as the Republic, the &amp;#147;nontraditional&amp;#8221; college student is becoming the norm. &lt;I&gt;Back to School&lt;/I&gt; is the first book to look at the schools that serve a growing population of &amp;#147;second-chancers,&amp;#8221; exploring what higher education&amp;#151;in the fullest sense of the term&amp;#151;can offer our rapidly changing society and why it is so critical to support the institutions that make it possible for millions of Americans to better their lot in life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the anecdotal style of his bestselling &lt;I&gt;Possible Lives&lt;/I&gt;, Rose crafts rich and moving vignettes of people in tough circumstances who find their way; who get a second . . . or third . . . or even fourth chance; and who, in a surprising number of cases, reinvent themselves as educated, engaged citizens. Rose reminds us that our nation&amp;#8217;s economic and civic future rests heavily on the health of the institutions that serve millions of everyday people&amp;#151;not simply the top twenty universities in &lt;I&gt;U.S. News and World Report&lt;/I&gt;&amp;#151;and paints a vivid picture of the community colleges and adult education programs that give so many a shot at reaching their aspirations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
