  <title>Sexual Addiction: Understanding and Treatment - Paul Becker Maed Lpc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book Sexual Addiction: Understanding and Treatment introduces graduate-level students to the field of sexual addiction. Graduate schools seek a textbook that specifically addresses the dynamics of sex addiction to complete their counseling education curriculum. Some professors have indicated that there is a dearth of targeted instructional content. This book fills that need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a compendium of Dr. Carnes research related to the treatment of sexually addicted men and women, the book will serve as clinical manual for therapists. Therapists are invited to use the recovery program presented as an effective treatment regimen for sex addicts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet pornography addicts men and women who have a weakness for sexual stimulation. One estimate is that as much as half of the male population and a third of the female population are addicted to pornography. The need for a relevant clinical tool is real. As such, the book contains thirty-six therapeutic exercises to help sexually addicted men and women, in conjunction with sex addiction therapy, to achieve long-term sexual sobriety.&lt;/p&gt;" />
