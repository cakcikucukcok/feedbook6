  <title>Student Teacher&#39;s Perceptions of the Pre-Service Mathematics Programme in a Primary Teachers&#39; College in Zimbabwe - Barnabas Muyengwa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This case study investigated the perceptions of the third year student teachers of the first year pre-service Mathematics programme at Seke Teachers&#39; College in Zimbabwe. Student background characteristics of gender, age, teaching experience and Mathematics specialisation were the independent variables also investigated. Data was collected from 278 third year students enrolled for the general Diploma in Education course using questionnaires with a five point Likert type 33 item rating scale and open ended items. The data so collected were analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively.
The findings indicated that although the programme was able to provide students with a foundation in subject knowledge more could be done to improve on training in teaching methods and provision of resources. From the variables investigated gender was found to have an effect on students&#39; perceptions of the programme but teaching experience was found to have no effect. The possible relationship between the independent variables of age and Mathematics specialisation and the dependent variable of students&#39; perception of the programme was indicated in too few items to warrant a definite conclusion.
Implications for the improvement of the programme are that there is need for the college to revisit some aspects of the structure and organisation of the programme. There is also need for further research involving all primary teachers&#39; colleges." />
