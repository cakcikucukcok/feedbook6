  <title>America&#39;s Best Colleges for B Students: A College Guide for Students Without Straight A&#39;s - Tamra B. Orr, Kelly Tanabe, Gen Tanabe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="High school students who get average grades and don&#39;t ace the SAT or ACT discover that an exceptional college education is by no means beyond their reach with this guide. Along with information on what to look for in a college and what colleges look for in their students besides grades, this college reference provides details on more than 175 colleges that make it a point to help students who have not achieved a stellar GPA and includes information on whether colleges feature extra tutoring, help from professors, and distance-learning programs. Advice on the application process emphasizes the schools that look beyond GPA to the extracurricular activities and community involvement at which many average students excel. Quelling both students&#39; and parents&#39; fears about finding a good education with a less-than-perfect academic record, this guide makes it clear that it is always possible. This updated edition has new data on student life, financial aid and costs, deadlines, and admissions information." />
