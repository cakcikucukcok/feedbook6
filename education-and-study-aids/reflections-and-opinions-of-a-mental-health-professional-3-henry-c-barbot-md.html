      <meta name="description" content="Like I said so many times before, this third version of Reflections and Opinions of a Mental Health Professional continue to cover the same journey I started about three years ago with the apparition of the first version of the book. It is about my multiple years of experience practicing in the field of psychiatry. The handling of my feeling in dealing with peoples mind, knowing how disastrous and damaging it could be for someone to lose his mind. This book is also about a field of medicine that has been bombarded, showered by a never-ending stereotype and my stubbornness, my tenacity at educating people about it, since I know for a fact that anyone can be hit by the catastrophe of mental illnesses since nobody is immune." />
