  <title>Understanding Asperger&#39;s Syndrome: Fast Facts: A Guide for Teachers and Educators to Address the Needs of the Student - Emily L Burrows, Sheila Wagner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The purpose of this guide is to help educators (teachers and administrators) become acquainted with identifying and meeting the needs of the student with Asperger&#39;s Syndrome. Public school, while often difficult for typical students, can be a nightmare for those students with Asperger&#39;s Syndrome. Without information and training in this disability, teachers face confusion and frustration in light of the unusual behaviors and lack of social skills. Without training, students with Asperger&#39;s Syndrome are misidentified and often blamed for behaviors that are a direct result of their disability. It is hoped that this guide will lead teachers to a better understanding of Asperger&#39;s Syndrome and help the students with AS have a richer, more enjoyable educational experience.
