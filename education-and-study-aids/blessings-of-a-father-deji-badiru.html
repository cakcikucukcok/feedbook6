  <title>Blessings of a Father - Deji Badiru</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is about my time and positive educational experiences at Saint Finbarrs College, Akoka-Yaba, Lagos, Nigeria. With the passage of time, knowledge of the immense contributions of Father Slattery is moving into the deeper recesses of our memories. The purpose of this book is to revive and keep the memory alive for the benefit of future generations of students, teachers, parents, school administrators, and government officials in Nigeria. This book, &lt;em&gt;Blessings of a Father: Education Contributions of Father Slattery at Saint Finbarrs College&lt;/em&gt;, is a second and updated printing of the first edition, Blessings of a Father, first published in Nigeria in 2005. This current printing is intended to facilitate a wider and more archival distribution of the book, whose first edition received rave reviews. It is hoped that through this book and other dedicated archival manuscripts, the legacy of Father Denis J. Slattery and what the Catholic Church did for education in Nigeria shall never die.&lt;/p&gt;" />
