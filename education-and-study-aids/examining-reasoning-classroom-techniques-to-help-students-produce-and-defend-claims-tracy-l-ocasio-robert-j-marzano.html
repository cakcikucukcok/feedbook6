      <meta name="description" content="Academic standards call for increased rigor, but simply raising complexity is not enough. Students need to know how to state a claim and support it with evidence. They must be able to examine their own thinking and the thinking of others. As they consider the logic in their reasoning, they become adept at examining errors, identifying flawed logic, and, ultimately, deepening their understanding of the content. &lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;Examining Reasoning: Classroom Techniques to Help Students Produce and Defend Claims&lt;I&gt; explores explicit techniques for mastering this crucial strategy of instructional practice. It includes:&lt;BR&gt;• Explicit steps for implementation&lt;BR&gt;• Recommendations for monitoring students&#39; ability to examine errors in reasoning&lt;BR&gt;• Adaptations for students who struggle, have special needs, or excel in learning&lt;BR&gt;• Examples and nonexamples from classroom practice&lt;BR&gt;• Common mistakes and ways to avoid them&lt;P&gt;The Essentials for Achieving Rigor series of instructional guides helps educators become highly skilled at implementing, monitoring, and adapting instruction. Put it to practical use immediately, adopting day-to-day examples as models for application in your own classroom." />
