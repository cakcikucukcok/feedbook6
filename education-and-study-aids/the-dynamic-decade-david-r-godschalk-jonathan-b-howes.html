  <title>The Dynamic Decade - David R. Godschalk, Jonathan B. Howes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;The Dynamic Decade&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of the sweeping makeover of the 200-year old campus of the University of North Carolina. Six million square feet of new buildings were constructed and a million square feet of historic buildings were renovated during one vibrant ten-year period.  To make this massive growth work required bold thinking. A new Master Plan created a vision for combining historic preservation, green building, and long-range development. A statewide bond issue for higher education capital facilities, supplemented with outside support, generated $1.5 billion in capital funding. Previous town-gown tensions were swept aside as university officials and elected leaders collaborated on critical planning and zoning innovations.  Award-winning plans and designs inspired new student living and learning communities. University facilities and construction staff doubled and a design review board formed to handle the increased load of new projects. Detailed design guidelines ensured that new development would be compatible with the traditional campus landscape as well as sensitive to environmental conservation.  Written by authors who held major planning roles and supplemented with key player interviews, the book describes the politics, planning, and design that shaped the Dynamic Decade.  Lavishly illustrated with color photographs and maps, this comprehensive account offers valuable lessons to all concerned with sustainable university growth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
