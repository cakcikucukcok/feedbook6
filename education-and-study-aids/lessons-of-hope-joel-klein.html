  <title>Lessons of Hope - Joel Klein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; Bestseller (Education)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Economist&lt;/em&gt; Best Books of the Year Selection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this revealing and provocative memoir, the former chancellor of the New York City schools offers the behind-the-scenes story of the city&amp;#8217;s dramatic campaign to improve public education and an inspiring blueprint for national reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2002 New York City&amp;#8217;s newly elected mayor, Michael Bloomberg, made a historic announcement: his administration had won control of the city&amp;#8217;s school system in a first step toward reversing its precipitous decline. In a controversial move, he appointed Joel Klein, an accomplished lawyer from outside the education establishment, to lead this ambitious campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lessons of Hope&lt;/em&gt; is Klein&amp;#8217;s inside account of his eight-year mission of improvement: demanding accountability, eliminating political favoritism, and battling a powerful teachers union that seemed determined to protect a status quo that didn&amp;#8217;t work for kids. Klein&amp;#8217;s initiatives resulted in more school choice, higher graduation rates, and improved test scores. The New York City model is now seen as a national standard for meaningful school reform. But the journey was not easy. Klein faced resistance and conflict at every turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lessons of Hope&lt;/em&gt; lays bare the problems plaguing public education and shows how they can be solved. At its core lies Klein&amp;#8217;s personal story: his humble upbringing in Brooklyn and Queens, and the key role that outstanding public school teachers played in nurturing his success. Engaging and illuminating, &lt;em&gt;Lessons of Hope&lt;/em&gt; is essential reading for anyone concerned about the future of American public education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
