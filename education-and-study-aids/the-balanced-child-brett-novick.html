  <title>The Balanced Child - Brett Novick</title>

As these images flash before their eyes, questions of character and developing this subset of such respective skills become ever more important. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;line-height:2&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This book will seek to tackle how to educate our children on the cornerstones of a humanistic foundation as a person; harboring those traits of responsibility, caring, honesty, and service to others. It will seek to help parents, educators, and most of all, children to recognize that in order to gain the necessary tools to be a fulfilled and contributing member of this world one must embrace these abilities (and not just as an afterthought and supplement to a successful life).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
