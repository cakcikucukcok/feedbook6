  <title>How to Write an Essay - Phil Rashid</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Learning English as a second language can be daunting for beginners. I want to allay the fears that confront students. This book will show students that by applying the recommended methods, from the initial first written title to the final concluding paragraph, they will find a clear way of essay construction.
The first chapters take the readers through the very basics of writing paragraphs.
Many students lose exam marks by not adhering to the basic principles of writing, namely, where and when to write capitals. Understanding the difference between titles and topics is also essential. The chapters then help you construct essays that will help students pass exams more easily with confidence. I hope they will enjoy future essay writing after mastering the techniques learnt from these instructions.
Philip Rashid, comes from London, England and has been teaching students English as their second language, in Malaysia, since 2004. His main participants have hailed from the Middle East; Africa and the Far East. His main forte, before coming to Malaysia, has been in sales. Working in street markets and running retail shops that have involved him with a wide range of ethnic communities.
However, teaching students English as their second language, has given him the necessary patience needed. His ability to see many things with a Lateral Vision, enables him to work out certain problems his students present to him.
By, putting himself in their shoes, he is able to comprehend many of their learning difficulties.
Married, to a Malaysian, with a, six-year old daughter who both speak fluent Malay, also present him with the same non-understanding, he knows his students feel, when confronted with the need for that extra vocabulary." />
