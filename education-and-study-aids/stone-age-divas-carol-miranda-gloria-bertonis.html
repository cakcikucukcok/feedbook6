  <title>Stone Age Divas - Carol Miranda, Gloria Bertonis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Women have made an enormous impact on life on the planet. They are deified and remembered in song, story, legend, and statues since at least 30,000 BC. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;We are, and have always been, brilliant inventors, innovators, and leaders for hundred and thousands of years. We are the survivors of everything that came our way and passed on our culture. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Women are the creators of life! A woman can create life inside her own body, give birth to another human being, and make milk from her own breasts to feed her newborn life. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The Goddesses are real mothers, actual women who lived, and created beautiful handiwork and incredible usable things from next to nothing; such as: spinning and weaving, making pots from dirt, farming, medicine, and writing. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;What a history! What a Gift to Civilization! Women were, and continue to be, the true Mothers of Invention! Stone Age Divas in the true sense of the word.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If every girl in the world reads about the Goddesses found in this book, she will have a firm foundation of self-esteem and inspiration to make wise choices in her life. Since time immemorial, women have bonded together in sisterhood to fight for noble causes in nonviolent ways. Women have always been, and continue to be, great benefactors of humanity. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&#39;Stone Age Divas: Their Mystery and Their Magic&#39;, takes an astonishing look at human beginnings never before attempted. It challenges our basic assumptions about gender, religion, and our civilization. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;B&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Warning: This book may be dangerous to your beliefs!&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/B&gt;" />
