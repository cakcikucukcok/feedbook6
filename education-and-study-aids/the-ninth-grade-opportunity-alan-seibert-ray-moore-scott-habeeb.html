  <title>The Ninth Grade Opportunity - Alan Seibert, Ray Moore, Scott Habeeb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Across the country, high school freshmen have the highest rates of failure, discipline problems, and truancy. Defined as the &quot;make it or break it&quot; year, ninth grade can be a trying time for teenagers learning to make their own way in the world. The Ninth Grade Opportunity provides educators with a useful framework to build and implement a team-based Freshman Transition program, ultimately allowing teachers to play an integral role in ensuring every student&#39;s success.&lt;p&gt;
Scott Habeeb, Ray Moore and Alan Seibert have over 60 years of combined experience as teachers and administrators, and together have compiled a guidebook centered around a teaming approach that empowers teachers to better meet freshmen needs. Based on concepts behind their popular Freshman Transition workshops, the authors share ideas about why and how teaming teachers works and how it can benefit schools. Road maps provide guidance for teachers to learn specifically how to create a program built around key elements such as:&lt;br/&gt;
Standardized expectations
Learning skills
Classroom leadership
Parent/teacher contact
&lt;p&gt;
Educators everywhere will benefit from the practical advice, expert insight, and helpful tips that transform the ninth grade problem into The Ninth Grade Opportunity, ensuring a successful transition for every high school student." />
