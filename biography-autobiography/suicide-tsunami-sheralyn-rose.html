  <title>Suicide Tsunami - Sheralyn Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Grieving a suicide can be an isolating experience. Shrouded in secrecy, stigma, and shame, suicide not only can be almost impossible to discuss openly, it also challenges many of our most fundamental values. Following the suicide of her husband, author Sheralyn Rose felt everything familiar had been swept away by an enormous wave. Attempting to adjust to the sadness that threatened to engulf her led her to question what influences someone to take their own life. Her need to understand the pain that precedes suicide motivated her to reveal the emotional roller coaster that often follows this dramatic event.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Suicide Tsunami&lt;/i&gt;, Rose uses her own experience as background, weaving stories of others through hers to create a collage of life beyond suicide. She exposes personal and moving accounts and ties them together to show how various people are affected. Identifying common reactions of confusion, embarrassment, and rejection, she is able to give this unique sorrow form. Suicide Tsunami exposes the soul of suicide grief; it brings us to the brink of what makes us human and shows that living in the aftermath can be rich and fulfilling.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;i&gt;I recommend this book for anyone who is surviving the loss of a loved one. It is a very personal account of Sheralyns journey through this loss and also other individuals who have experienced a similar loss  It is compassionate and discusses many aspects of suicide that many people would find difficult to talk about.&lt;/i&gt; Dr Jennifer Rathjen, Clinical Psychologist &lt;/P&gt;" />
