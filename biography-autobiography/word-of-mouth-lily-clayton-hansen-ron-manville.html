  <title>Word of Mouth - Lily Clayton Hansen, Ron Manville</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Word of Mouth: More Conversations? &lt;/em&gt;is Hansen&amp;rsquo;s follow-up to ?&lt;em&gt;Word of Mouth: Nashville Conversations&lt;/em&gt;, the visually stunning coffee table book that inspired yearlong art installations and partnerships with Vanderbilt University, the Nashville Entrepreneur Center, and the Nashville International Airport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Shannah Game of the Millennial Money Podcast has put it best, &amp;ldquo;?Lily Clayton-Hansen? captures people&amp;rsquo;s lives through storytelling and photography, with soul-revealing&amp;nbsp;depth and artistic charm in her book...Through her journey, Hansen has found her calling and unleashed her genius in more ways than one.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Much like it&amp;rsquo;s predecessor, ?&lt;em&gt;Word of Mouth: More Conversations?&lt;/em&gt; features intimate interviews paired with striking photography by Nashville-based photographer Ron Manville. Manville has shot 70+ cookbooks and has 18 National and International awards, including four&amp;nbsp;James Beards, under his belt. The pair partnered on ?&lt;em&gt;More Conversations&lt;/em&gt; ?to find out what it&amp;rsquo;s really like to build one&amp;rsquo;s career. Hansen hopes that her chosen cast of&amp;nbsp;characters represents the textured, complex, creative&amp;nbsp;mecca that is Nashville. &amp;ldquo;These are real life role&amp;nbsp;models in your own backyard,&amp;rdquo; she explains. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;nbsp;better way to learn about a city and what makes it so&amp;nbsp;dynamic than through your neighbors?&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Word of Mouth Conversations brand is built on&amp;nbsp;curiosity, conversation, and face-to-face connection.&amp;nbsp;After moving Nashville in 2012, Hansen was looking&amp;nbsp;for her niche as a writer. She began reaching out to&amp;nbsp;people she admired, setting up meetings, and asking&amp;nbsp;them for advice. She soon realized as she connected&amp;nbsp;with these everyday heroes that&amp;nbsp;they had a significant&amp;nbsp;amount of wisdom to offer. Now Hansen has her&amp;nbsp;dream job: talking to people about what they do all day long and how they feel about what they do&amp;mdash;similar to her role model, famed Chicago interviewer Studs Terkel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her ?&lt;em&gt;More&amp;nbsp;Conversations?&lt;/em&gt; interview, Kurdish spokesperson and co-founder of the Welcoming Tennessee Initiative Kasar Abdulla explains, &amp;ldquo;?I personally believe we all have a noble purpose, and it&amp;rsquo;s just a matter of us discovering&amp;nbsp;and then acting upon it.&amp;quot; Hansen hopes that these&amp;nbsp;nuggets of wisdom will inspire her readers to pursue&amp;nbsp;whatever it is that they love.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The interviews in ?&lt;em&gt;Word of Mouth: More Conversations&lt;/em&gt; prove that greatness is not defined by fame, money, or social&amp;nbsp;media status, but rather what you give back during your time on&amp;nbsp;earth. &amp;ldquo;Doing what&amp;nbsp;you love is not&amp;nbsp;easy,&amp;rdquo; Hansen&amp;nbsp;explains. &amp;ldquo;No one&amp;nbsp;can cheat their way to success but putting in the hours is well worth it.&amp;rdquo; By giving her subjects a&amp;nbsp;voice, she hopes to shine the light on others who doing great work in the world. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot by keeping my mouth shut, ears open, and mind unblocked,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;I hope to give a glimpse into the texture, tone, and complexity of the human spirit.&amp;rdquo; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Hansen has taken her brand global, creating international interview series in cities such as London. Her style is one that combines the art of storytelling with a cultural and sociological perspective. By getting to know others Hansen has gotten to know herself inside and out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
