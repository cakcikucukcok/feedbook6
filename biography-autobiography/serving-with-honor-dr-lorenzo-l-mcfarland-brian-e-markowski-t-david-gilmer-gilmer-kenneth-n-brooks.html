  <title>Serving with Honor - Dr. Lorenzo L McFarland, Brian E. Markowski, T. David Gilmer Gilmer, Kenneth N. Brooks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wanted to change my life so I joined the military during a time when gays were not welcomed. While joining the military brought me out of a challenging situation, it was the beginning of a difficult journey. A journey I was able to navigate, but so many others were not so fortunate.
&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;i&gt;Serving with Honor: Under a Cloak of Silence&lt;/i&gt; depicts the life of Dr. Lorenzo McFarland, along with three close friends, who served before and during the time of Dont Ask Dont Tell (DADT). This book answers that most interesting question of what it was like for gays in the military under DADT. In our own words we bare our souls and answer some of the tough questions not asked or answered before now. Questions like: Why join in the fi rst place? What was basic training like? How did we protect our careers? Would we serve again? 
&lt;br&gt;
We talk about exhaustive efforts creating elaborate webs to protect our secret. This book also depicts our patriotism and commitment to the military mission and this great country. Despite DADT, we served with honor and found great success." />
