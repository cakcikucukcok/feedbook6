  <title>Destiny Has No Favorites - Dieter Klett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This is a story of a person arriving in this country in this country and in this city where he eventually ended up in the middle of the night, not knowing a soul in Canada and having just about $10.- in his pocket. Using my imagination I let this imaginary person - Peter- show the reader the adventures and misadventures he and eventually his family experienced in this for him so strange and at the same time exciting new place. I decided to cover a period of roughly the first 25 years Peter spent in his new chosed homeland. I could have continued showing the development of his and his family&#39;s life after the 25 year period, but I decided against that. I wanted this story to have closure. Another possible book would show the reader how Peter&#39;s life continued after 25 years and would show us how he and his loved ones continued with their lives with its ups and downs. The gist of the events occured from the mid 1950&#39;s until the early 1980&#39;s. I actually completed this book in 1982. It was lying in my filing cabinet for 30 years, because I never had either the time or inclination to publish in writing. The title of this publication: &quot;Destiny has no Favorites&quot; is correct. Destiny, or fate, has no favorites and we all are at the mercy of this destiny destined for us by that higher power we may call God, Nature, the Absolute Being, the Creator, Providence, the Omnipotent, Being the Supreme Soul or whatever mage us feel better to accept the unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
