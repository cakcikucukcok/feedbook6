  <title>True Confessions from the Ninth Concession - Dan Needles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author and playwright Dan Needles has long delighted readers and audiences alike with his insightful and laugh-out-loud perspective on small-town life, published in such bestselling books as &lt;em&gt;Wingfield&#39;s World&lt;/em&gt; (Random House, 2011), &lt;em&gt;Wingfield&#39;s Hope&lt;/em&gt; (Key Porter, 2005), &lt;em&gt;With Axe and Flask&lt;/em&gt; (McFarlane, Walter and Ross, 2002) and &lt;em&gt;Letters From Wingfield Farm&lt;/em&gt; (Key Porter, 1988). &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;In 1988, Needles and his wife left the city to start a family in a country community located two hours north of Toronto. Together they stocked their farm with sheep, cattle, chickens, pigs and, eventually, four children. Needles&#39; charming chronicle unfolds in essays dated from 1997 to 2016, offering homespun advice for successful country living--like whether to wave from the elbow or to merely raise one finger from the steering wheel when passing a neighbour in the car. He cautions on rural superstitions, such as when his neighbour hesitated before selling him weaner pigs because every time he does the wife of the farmer who&#39;s buying them becomes pregnant--which turned out to be true. Here too is the tale of an unlikely friendship between a &quot;borderline&quot; collie (&quot;he&#39;s never bitten anything in his life and the sheep are catching on&quot;) and an odd duck named Ferdinand, as well as other hilarious stories involving an assortment of farm animals, including the weapon of choice to properly dispatch a rooster-gone-bad; the risks of giving a name to a potential Sunday dinner entr&amp;eacute;e; and how to outsmart a free-range pig. With his witty insight, Needles shares the art of neighbouring in the country--a place made for visits, and &quot;where a figure walking across your field is more of a reason to put the kettle on than to call the police.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;True Confessions from the Ninth Concession&lt;/em&gt; is a sesquicentennial crop of antics and aphorisms by Canada&#39;s funniest farmer--one that presents a wonderful escape for world-weary city dwellers, and affirmative reading for anyone who is from, or has moved to, rural Canada. &lt;/p&gt;" />
