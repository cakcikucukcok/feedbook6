  <title>Advocate for the Convicted Felon - Wise</title>
      <meta name="description" content="America has a history of being courageous, conquerors and brave. However, there are issues in its backyard that has either been ignored or over looked; that is the issue of the convicted felon. There are barriers that prohibit felons from obtaining employment, gaining occupational licensing and even voting. I learned in life that every situation or circumstance has a root. The convicted felon issue has roots that has been seeded throughout American history. I use my personal story growing up in Southside Jamaica Queens; then I give an essay of how I perceive these circumstances came about. Lastly, I turn to the laws of America. I attempt to show how the laws in America worked for the African American. 
In a nutshell, I attempt to show how American society has systematically created what we know as &quot;The Felon&quot;" />
