&lt;p&gt;But there is a story that could be told about each of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is one of those people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Her hidden life will take your breath away if you really get to know her. She is more than just an ordinary acquaintance. There is a depth to her that only the most intimate associates know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Here is your opportunity to really know that person with whom you rubbed elbows. It will provide you with insights that you had never known previously. It will make you a better person in the bargain. Her life can be a catalyst for you to begin to find ways to love and comfort your suffering brothers and sisters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our broken world certainly needs more people like her. You can be such a person.&lt;/p&gt;" />
