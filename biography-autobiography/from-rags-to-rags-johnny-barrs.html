  <title>From Rags to Rags - Johnny Barrs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Well, it took along time to write, I hope you think its worth it.  Whats it about?  A good question, I wish I knew.  You could read it to find out.  Basically its about my career in show business as a thespian.  Well, they cant touch you for it.  I come from a working class family who had no roots in show business.  My interest began at an early age.  My father often took me to our local theatre where we would sit in the Gallery to see the shows.  I just loved it and wanted to be part of it.  But how to do it, that was the question.  When at first you dont succeed, pack it in.  Not me, I ignored that completely.  I was given a book one Christmas on HOW TO BECOME A COMEDIAN.  Ive been trying ever since.  After that, I went into a local Concert Party and at last I had my feet on the ladder of success but I had a long way to go before I turned professional.
I was In the RA.F. 1951/53 doing my National Service where I did shows with professional entertainer Johnny Leeson and Guest Artist, Dennis Spicer,  (a ventriloquist)  and Terry Seabrooke  (A Comedy Magician)  who became a lifelong friend.  Can you believe it, I was defending my Country.  God knows what would have happened if we had been at war. We would have thrown jokes at the enemy, not bombs.
After leaving the R.A.F. in July 1953, I joined another Concert Party called, The Barnstormers.  I was also doing The Working Mens Clubs, for the enormous fee, when I say enormous, I was on 5 per night and for that, I did 4 spots.  Well, you have to start somewhere.
In August 1960 I married my wife Jan.  Weve now been married for over 50 years.  Not a bad run for show business. Is it?
In 1963 I turned professional when I was offered my first summer season on the Isle of Wight.  In 1965 I did my first Pantomime Aladdin at my Local Rep.  This was the start of many years doing weekly Repertory Theatre up and down the country, and in 1971, I was offered a National Tour appearing in Agatha Christies FIDDLERS FIVE.  I was busy in the 1970s doing summer seasons and pantomimes in England, Scotland, and Wales
In the 1980s and 90s I moved into television and Commercials.
I wrote a musical in the 1990s called, The FLANAGAN &amp; ALLEN Story in which I played my Idol BUD FLANAGAN, on and off for the next 12 years, Finally, it was time for me to hang up my fur coat and straw boater.  I did achieve my ambition and became professional.  I also met and worked with many stars." />
