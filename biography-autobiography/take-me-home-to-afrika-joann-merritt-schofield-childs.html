  <title>Take Me Home to Afrika - Joann Merritt Schofield-Childs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an autobiography honestly sketched in faith and love celebrating a dream come true. This book is recommended not only for family, friends and Afrikans of the Diaspora with the desire to be in Afrika but also for those of the continent, especially Ghana, who can glean the recognition of their hospitality, and to note also the shortcomings which they take for granted and of which the author has shown understanding and tolerance.&lt;/br&gt;
Professor G. Sodah Ayernor, PhD, President, Afrikan Renaissance Foundation&lt;/p&gt;
 In the pages that follow the reader will come to admire Adjoa for sharing so many of the intimate details of her life in Ghana! We see her grow spiritually, emotionally, socially and intellectually. This autobiography is a love story between two mature adults. It is a spiritual awakening for Adjoa who learns to trust the God within! It is an inspirational account of faith in the goodness of humanity! It is an identity narrative about discovering what it means to be African. Lastly, it is a coming of age talein Ghana Adjoa learned to embrace her own agency as a woman of African descent!&lt;/br&gt;
