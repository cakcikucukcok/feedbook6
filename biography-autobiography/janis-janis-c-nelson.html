  <title>Janis - Janis C. Nelson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Janis grew up in North Sacramento where neighbors were like family. When her parents divorced and sold their home, Janis learned to adapt to many different environments. She milked cows on her aunt&#39;s farm, attended a one-room schoolhouse and found the love of her life in a beautiful little town called Round Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book contains a kaleidoscope of cherished moments ranging from childhood memories to family history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Janis and her husband, Ted, decided to &quot;smell the roses&quot; as they went along, so they saved up all winter in order to travel a week or two in the summer. They appreciate the opportunities to have seen many awesome things of beauty on their journeys like DaVinci&#39;s statue of David, The Hope Diamond and the Lincoln Monument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Retirement is a gift of time to enjoy family, grandkids, yard sales and casinos. There are still places to see, so the traveling itch may need a little more scratching. &lt;/p&gt;" />
