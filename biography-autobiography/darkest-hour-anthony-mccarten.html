Invasion seems mere hours away.&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&amp;#160;Just days after becoming Prime Minister, Winston Churchill must deal with this horror&amp;#8212;as well as a skeptical King, a party plotting against him, and an unprepared public. Pen in hand and typist-secretary at the ready, how could he change the mood and shore up the will of a nervous people?&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;In this gripping day-by-day, often hour-by-hour account of how an often uncertain Churchill turned Britain around, the celebrated Bafta-winning writer Anthony McCarten exposes sides of the great man never seen before. He reveals how he practiced and re-wrote his key speeches, from &amp;#8216;Blood, toil, tears and sweat&amp;#8217; to &amp;#8216;We shall fight on the beaches&amp;#8217;; his consideration of a peace treaty with Nazi Germany, and his underappreciated role in the Dunkirk evacuation; and, above all, how 25 days helped make one man an icon.&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;&amp;#160;Using never-before-accessed archive material, McCarten reveals the crucial behind-the-scenes moments that changed the course of history. It&amp;#8217;s a scarier&amp;#8212;and more human&amp;#8212;story than has ever been told.&lt;u5:p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;u5:p&gt;" />
