  <title>No Longer Whispering to Power - Thandeka Gqubule</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Thuli Madonsela achieved in seven years as Public Protector what few accomplish in a lifetime; her legacy and contribution cannot be overstated. In her final days in office she compiled the explosive State of Capture report and, two years before that, Secure in Comfort, the report on President Jacob Zuma&amp;amp;#8217;s Nkandla residence. Praised and vilified in equal measure, Madonsela frequently found herself on centre stage in the increasingly fractious South African political scene.
Yet, despite the intense media scrutiny, Madonsela remains something of an enigma. Who is this soft-spoken woman who stood up to state corruption? Where did she develop her views and resolve? In No Longer Whispering to Power Thandeka Gqubule, journalist and one of the &amp;amp;#8216;SABC 8&amp;amp;#8217; fired and rehired by the broadcaster, attempts to answer these questions, and others, by exploring aspects of Madonsela&amp;amp;#8217;s life: her childhood years and family, her involvement in student politics, her time in prison, her contribution to the Constitution, and her life in law.&lt;/p&gt;" />
