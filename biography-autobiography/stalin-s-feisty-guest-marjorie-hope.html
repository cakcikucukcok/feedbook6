  <title>Stalin’S Feisty Guest - Marjorie Hope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Felicia, gifted with her knowledge of European languages, flees with her toddler son from Warsaw as war rages. Her physician husband is sent to the war front as part of the Polish army.
Her neutral haven is soon taken over by Russian military. They arrest her and put her and her son on a cattle car train that ends up in Kazakhstan, Central Asia, at a Russian-run prison camp.
After Russia is invaded by Hitler, an amnesty is declared. The prisoners fortunes change for the better.
In an astonishing twist, Felicia and her camp friends are all eventually allowed to return to Poland on a fascinating train ride. Concerned about her prospects, she seeks refuge elsewhere, for a time in France and, eventually, in America." />
