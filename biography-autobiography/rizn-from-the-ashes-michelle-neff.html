  <title>RIZN from the ashes - Michelle Neff</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am a breast cancer survivor, but I prefer to be called a crusader.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On June 6, 2013, I just got finished with an employee orientation at Meadville Wesbury Nursing Home. I told my employers I might have breast cancer but probably not. So it was a huge shock when the doctor later said my biopsy showed not only one but two cancerous lumps. The doctor suggested a total left breast mastectomy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I cried with my mom. I was also going through much mental anguish due to an unwanted divorce, empty nest syndrome, and my sick grandmother, who I was caring for. I was inundated with life-changing stressors, and I was so exhausted already from all the changes in my life. My breast cancer roller coaster ride was just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of my mom&amp;rsquo;s friends was my mentor, answering all of my questions. The first thing she told me to remember was that&lt;strong&gt; breast cancer is not a death sentence&lt;/strong&gt;. This is especially true when it&amp;rsquo;s in its early stages, and mine was, thank God. I can&amp;rsquo;t stress enough how so very important it is to get those annual mammograms. That was my affirmation, along with the T-shirt my daughter Rachel designed: Keep Calm and Fight On. I decided as I was going through this journey to write a memoir, RIZN from the ASHES.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breast cancer actually saved my life. I am now newly married, and I am crusader for early breast cancer detection and mental health recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks for letting me share my story,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Michelle Neff&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
