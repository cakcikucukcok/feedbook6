  <title>The Wishing Well - Mark Faris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When Mark Faris first met Cate Greenway, he knew she was an angel. As a teenager hanging out with the neighborhood kids in 1970s Kansas City, Faris often went with his friends to Cates house and enjoyed picnics next to the wishing well in her field. They found safety and love there, and Cate became a guiding light for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even after Faris moved to Minneapolis and started a new life, he never forgot Cate. But it was years later in 2009 that Cate became an even more important influence on his life. After decades of self-interest, combined with his wobbly faith, Faris was convicted of money laundering, mail fraud, and wire fraud. He was incarcerated in a federal prison and separated from his family and friends. It was in prison that Cate appeared to him in angelic form, pushing Faris to make faith, love, and service for God the highest priorities in his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chronicling the drowsy summer days under under Cate&#39;s sprawling oak tree, his venture into the business world, and his renewal of faith in God, The Wishing Well is an honest look at Fariss life and how one special angel transformed it forever.&lt;/p&gt;" />
