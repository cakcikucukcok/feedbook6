  <title>Sur’Reality - Carl D. Schultz</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Existence as such cannot be controlledit can only be observed. And in a sense, reality is not in fact physical, but figural. Yet despite these truths about the elusive nature of reality, a concrete definition of these concepts may provide a way to grasp a wider understanding of our being. For while intangible realities like our thoughts and our imaginations can be considered by skeptics as merely hallucinations or immaterial, in a real sense it is also true that they are rooted in the brain and are thus intermittently physical as well; therefore, given this possibility, even our dreams may become reality.&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Surreality explores these questions and more through the autobiographical history of an author confronted at once with the challenges of life and the realities of distant memories. Teetering on the boundaries of language and a play on the sometimes surreal landscape of existence that is nevertheless based sur la ralit, or on reality, it likewise offers a window into a mind where the physical and the figurativethe brain and the imagination, consciousness, and memoryconstantly enmesh and decouple to create a perplexing reality.&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mind and brain are complex and intricately related, and together they form a reality whose contours can only be traced by our own perceptions. Bending our understanding of memory, perception, and language can open up a space to envision the possibilitythe realityof our imaginations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
