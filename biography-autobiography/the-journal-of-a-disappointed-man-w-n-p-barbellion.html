  <title>The Journal of a Disappointed Man - W.N.P. Barbellion</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Published shortly before the author&#39;s death in 1919, &lt;I&gt;The Journal of a Disappointed Man&lt;/I&gt; presents a remarkable memoir that addresses struggles with poverty, inadequate education, and the creeping paralysis of multiple sclerosis. Yet author W. N. P. Barbellion manages to write with uplifting eloquence and passion of his love for family, natural history, music, and literature. Told with a thoroughly modern voice, the unjustly overlooked &lt;I&gt;Journal&lt;/I&gt; is reprinted here with its posthumous successor, &lt;I&gt;A Last Diary.&lt;/I&gt; This edition features a thoughtful Introduction by H. G. Wells, who writes of the book&#39;s &quot;exquisite beauty.&quot; &lt;BR&gt;W.&amp;nbsp;N. P. Barbellion (1889&amp;#8211;1919), whose real name was Bruce Frederick Cummings, was a&amp;nbsp;naturalist who worked in the Entomology Department of London&#39;s Natural History Museum. Upon attempting to enlist in the British Army during World War I, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The discovery of his disease intensified the tenor of his journal-keeping, and his frank and articulate reflections on coping with a fatal illness remain a powerful testament to his life and struggles.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;" />
