  <title>How Oneness Changes Everything - Ratanjit</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1968, Ratanjit Sondhe  	 came to America from India with eight dollars in his pocket to study polymer science. In 1973, he launched a company, PolyCarb. Thirty-four years later, he sold his highly successful company to The Dow Chemical Company.
Through his remarkable entrepreneurial journey, Ratanjit transformed his companys mission, vision, and values to successfully retrieve it from the brink of bankruptcy and re-shape it into a vital industry leader. How Oneness Changes Everything: Empowering Business Through 9 Universal Laws, is the true story of how Sondhe discovered that timeless Universal Truths, when applied to business, are the real secret to success and the core of business sustainability.
Beyond IQ and EQ (Emotional Intelligence), Sondhe brings cutting-edge Spiritual Intelligence into practical focus for the next generation of entrepreneurs and corporate leaders. Sondhes message has powerful implications for every business and individual, as well as the U.S. and world economies as he demonstrates how to re-align capitalism with its true purpose: continually making our best better, making a positive difference in the world, and becoming resilient and highest value-adding entities.
Unleash the dynamic power of your innermost self operating in alignment with Universal Truth to fuel innovation, continuous improvement, wealth creation and, ultimately, real, sustainable value. Reinvigorate your business and your life with a new understanding of: 
  Purpose
