  <title>Learning to Heal - N. Lee Sharp</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dealing with the loss of a loved one can indeed put a toll
on a persons life and can naturally affect ones view of
the world. Nonetheless, this is not a permanent state of
being, for hope is possible and if nurtured well can bring great
fruits. This is the gist of author N Lee Sharps new book titled
Learning to Heal. A riveting work about one womans journey
to recovery, this one-of-a-kind selection takes readers to a path of
knowledge, wisdom, strength and endurance.
Sharps story is an enlightening tool which can teach millions about
what it truly means to be a woman. Empowering, this book provides
an up-close and personal glimpse into the symbolic experience of
loss, wherein the experience of endings becomes a necessary rite of
passage for the emergence of new beginnings.
Though dramatic and fi lled with poignant episodes, this book not
only provides enlightenment, but also a sense of humor, reminding
readers that although emotions can get in the way of ones outlook,
human beings are also capable of making a choice, to, whether or
not, destroy or uplift their own realities. Overall, Sharps witty,
profound and amusing style of writing is indeed a testimony to
the amount of power that is inevitably gained from transforming
tragedy into triumph." />
