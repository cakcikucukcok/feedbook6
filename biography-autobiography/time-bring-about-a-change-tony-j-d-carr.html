  <title>Time Bring About a Change - Tony J.D. Carr</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1969, when Tony Carr was in the fourth grade, he was taken from his mixed-race school and transferred to a different, predominantly-white school. He didn&amp;#39;t realize it at the time, but he was on the front lines of a historic event, an entire generation taking the first faltering steps in the nation&amp;#39;s march toward racial equality.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since that time, society has made strides toward integration and coexistence. Programs were created to give minorities equal access to education and jobs. African-Americans began playing major roles in national politics, sports, and entertainment; television programs began to show interracial dating and black people in powerful positions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Much has changed since 1969.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But, as Carr has experienced firsthand, many things have not changed, and our national journey toward equality and acceptance is far from over. Carr has lived to witness his father respond submissively to a verbally abusive young white man in front of his family&amp;ndash;and he lived to learn his father&amp;#39;s reasons for doing so when he was in a similar situation with his family, understanding then that the safety of his loved ones was worth any price.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Through his black memorabilia collections, classes, and community involvement, Carr has discovered that what goes around comes around. Time Bring About A Change brings us the story of how one man has dedicated his life to raising awareness that color is, truly, just a color, and that the true worth of a person is found in the respect, love, and caring that person shows to all around." />
