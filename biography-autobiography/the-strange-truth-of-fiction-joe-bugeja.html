  <title>The Strange Truth of Fiction - Joe Bugeja</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The author turns true experiences into stories that adorn his biographies and autobiographies.  He does so as a means of information, instruction and discussion.  In fact he provides authentic insights of the human predicament in a universe that is sometimes friendly, sometimes hostile but often indifferent. He also delineates the human aspect in realistic living characters.
 The narration of many incidents and accidents is woven into his stories reinforced by imaginative fiction. True tragic incidents are both intensely dramatic and highly emotional.  They engender sympathy and empathy that imprints them as true to life.
On the other hand, comic episodes in the life of the characters stimulate humour, an element of pleasant relief and entertainment. True or imaginary they embellish the literary world by allowing the readers&#39; participation in adventures of ordinary people.
 Personal experiences encompass man&#39;s journey on earth, no matter how colourless and humdrum is his life. However man&#39;s physical activities, such as travels to nearby or to distant countries, enrich life experiences.   In addition, man&#39;s thought, stimulated by philosophical dicta, makes him aware of the hidden truths of his universal role. As a human being, Man is subject to superior forces. He is buffeted by coincidences, destiny, misfortune and even Providence.
Though this collection of stories may encapsulate a short span of a man&#39;s life, they are in essence true to life.   Though plot may be coloured by imaginative fiction, the stories are characteristic of a true narration and a recording of what truly happened. Thus, the reader should evaluate the story by its truth rather than by other characteristic structures.  
Nevertheless, the author considers these stories more as a literature of escape than of interpretation. Yet they broaden the readers&#39; vision and sharpen their awareness of the everyday reality of life. The stories are certainly true to life. They illustrate various reactions and other aspects of human behaviour," />
