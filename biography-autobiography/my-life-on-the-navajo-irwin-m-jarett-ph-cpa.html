  <title>My Life on the Navajo - Irwin M. Jarett Ph Cpa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book is a history of My Life on the Navajo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was assigned to travel to the Navajo Nation at Window Rock Arizona to help a group of seven Professors create an Indian school of medicine. After that I came to the Navajo for a week each month for the next eight years. I helped the Controller, Dino, with their accounting and their silver business. We became good friends and had a number of great experiences. I made other friends on the Navajo including the first Miss Navajo, Beulah Allen, who taught me about the Navajo life and how the Mountains came together at night. I also found the lost city of Lukichuki, which is now one of the busiest sites on the reservation. What a great experience.&lt;/p&gt;" />
