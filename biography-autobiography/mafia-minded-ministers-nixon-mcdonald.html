  <title>Mafia Minded Ministers - Nixon McDonald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;This is a true story about a mans life, it is a revealing story and its not meant to down grade or make negative the ministry of the gospel. It is to share some of the things that happened to me in my life, so that it will help some young minister that may experience similar situation. &lt;br /&gt;This story is about a group of minister that had many members and substance, but because of greed, envy and power, they tried to keep others from having anything, thus emulating the mafia tactics on a fellow minister by trying to hinder him and even to put the church he pastored out of business. They seemed to have the idea that the young minister was infringing on their territory, if he were not stopped. They tried everything in their power to stop him. &lt;br /&gt;If youve ever seen a mafia movie you would actually think that this was an enactment of a Mafia scene played out on stage, where one mob boss would use force and tries to put the other out of business. This is the type story you are about to read, only instead of the Mafia, its Mafia Minded Ministers. Read the story and judge for yourself! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Nixon McDonald, Jr&lt;/div&gt;" />
