  <title>Crying in Silence - Timothy J. O&#39;Leary</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an extraordinary autobiography relating to a young Womans experience living with Cerebral Palsy and its accompanying seizures.  Shelley     OLeary addresses her affliction in a realistic manner in that she acknowledges her physical status with a commitment to overcome her deficiency and a determination not to admit failure. With her God-given gifts of empathy and kindness, Shelley has served as a Role Model for the children she cares for on a daily basis in an educational forum. She has been blessed with the support of the medical community, her friends, co-workers, and, most importantly, her Family.  When told that she would never be able to attend higher education, Shelley refused to despair and decided to tackle head-on a college curriculum on two separate occasions.  This refusal to give in to self-pity has culminated in her acquiring two Associate Degrees, one in Business Management, and the other in Therapeutic Recreation.  Shelley works at the prestigious Morrison Center for the Physically-Challenged in the Greater Portland, Maine area. As you read her story, you will attest to her &quot;never say die&quot; attitude and her childhood mantra, &quot;My Do It!&quot;  Shelley Lynn OLeary demonstrates having the &quot;heart of a lion&quot; and is an extraordinary example of a willingness to overcome any and all obstacles." />
