  <title>Shared Memories - Jamie Zwiebel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;&lt;center&gt;I, an astronaut, a pioneer
traversing the farthest reaches
of a universe I once forgot
that comes alive
when I open my eyes
and look up.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
In her first collection of poetry, Jersey girl Jamie Zwiebel offers memories as she comes of age and travels the world during the 1990s and 2000s.
During a time when the Backstreet Boys monopolized the radio waves, Monica Lewinski dominated the headlines, and e-mail, blogging, and skyping were becoming ways of life, millennials each began their own unique journeys in an interconnected world. Zwiebel offers a compelling glimpse into an unforgettable period in history when a young generation began to question the past, discover new ideas, and feel love, loss, faith, and differenceall while uncertainty, fear, wars, and a global recession raged in the background. As she offers memories of sipping &lt;i&gt;fanta con vino&lt;/i&gt; at a tapas bar in Nicaragua while realizing an appreciation for simplicity and the freedom that change brings, Zwiebel transports others through the emotions, hopes, and dreams of a generation like no other.
The warm-hearted, relatable, and lyrical expressions included in Shared Memories encourage millennials and others to rediscover the true meaning of their destiny in an ever-changing world." />
