  <title>Lost Youth Volume 2 - Christian Simpson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lost Youth Volume 2 London is the follow up to the critically acclaimed bestselling novel, `Lost Youth Volume 1 New Zealand`.
Here now continues this incredible true life story of one man&#39;s life that took him from a lonely prison cell in New Zealand to England bound at the young age of 20 years old. Once in London without knowing anyone and with only the clothes on his back, he campaigned for the next 5 years of his life for the release of the notorious gangland crime boss Reggie Kray from a 30 year prison sentence.
What was to come next in the authors life was unexpected as not only did he step straight into the underbelly surroundings of the British underworld, one of the most powerful gangland families in British history, he too was swept into the world of show-business.  Starting out in the music industry thanks to the kind hearts of two people, a lovely Irish lady by the name of Eileen Sweeney and an old school Irish gentleman by the name of Vince Power.  The author was given work at The Mean Fiddler in Harlesden, which at time was the most famous live music venue in all of the British Isles.
He then went on to making a career for himself, going on to working with such names as Michael Jackson, Jon Bon Jovi, Paul McCartney, Tricky, Elton John, Janet Jackson to name only a few that saw this young man take the correct path in life rather than a life of crime. He chooses rock n roll rather than a life spent behind jailed bars. He turned his life around for the better and went onto great heights that could never have been dreamed of.
This book will take you on one hell of an adventure but one you will need to hold on tight as there are many shakes, rattles and rolls along the way. It is an inspiration to anyone who has ever suffered or given up on their hopes and dreams. Its what films are made of, Hollywood will be sure to be knocking soon." />
