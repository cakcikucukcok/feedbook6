  <title>The Milky Way - Insook Kim Won</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Insook Wons peaceful childhood years were marred when the Korean War broke out. She began to support her family at the age of fifteen. A high school music teacher gave Won her first voice lessons, which led her to the world of singing. Despite the many obstacles, she persisted in pursuing her academic goals. 
&lt;p&gt;Determined to study at a university in the United States, she received a scholarship and managed to secure a visa and travel funds. With the assurance she received from a young professors family, she came to Miami, Florida, to study voice at the University of Miami. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon completing her masters degree, she married Duk Joong Won, a longtime church friend. She moved to Washington, DC, where he was working on postgraduate studies. She was selected as a Teacher Corps intern and candidate for her second masters degree in teaching. She served public schools in three counties in the Washington metropolitan area for a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She and her husband raised two daughters. As her husband was called to do ministry, she was by his side ministering, serving the needy, directing choirs, refining her voice as a soloist, and deepening her love of God.&lt;/p&gt;" />
