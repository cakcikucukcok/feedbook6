  <title>White Roses in a Dream - Marvela Dawnay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div id=&quot;00N40000001lfFy_ileinner&quot;&gt;While writing this sequel to my first book, MANipulated Into Fear, There Is Always A Pattern, I couldnt understand how I was able to live the dark side of life while others perceived me as living a happy normal life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was devastated at the thought of being unemployed now and allowing my relationship with an abuser to affect my family and me, and our lives. I began to realize that I, too, had traits, patterns and action plans, just like Rolf, and that there was always a pattern of abuse within families. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irrational thoughts entered my mind, and I began contemplating ending Rolfs life before he ended mine. In the same vein, if I didnt murder Rolf, I felt the need for me to take my own life to stop living in fear because of Rolf. I was hoping that there was a way for me to control my fear, when one day, I saw white roses and knew that they symbolized new beginnings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several months later, I left to go on vacation to Germany and hoped that I would be able to leave my feelings of fear behind. Sometimes, one never knows what to expect on a trip. There were times when I felt like Cinderella, had quite an adventure, and wished that I had brought my weapon for protection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I returned home, something very unexpected happened to me. I had a relationship with a man that seemed to be surreal. One can only continue to pray for white roses in a dream, and hope for a new beginning with their life. It doesnt always have to be a dream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Five Stars) ForeWord Clarion Review - &lt;em&gt;Elizabeth Millard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this sequel, Dawnay broadens the focus from getting past her own hurt, shame, and victimization to helping others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Dawnay provides more narrative about her life after Rolf--writing the first book, traveling to Germany, tentatively starting a new relationship--she focuses on her inner journey from victim to victor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dawnay&#39;s ability to detail and draw meaning for others from her painful experiences is strengthened by her straightforward, conversational writing style. Like a long letter from a friend, White Roses In A Dream strikes a personal, thoughtful tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who suspect they may be dealing with abusive patterns in their own relationships, or seeing them among friends or family, Dawnay offers simple and powerful advice. &lt;/p&gt;
