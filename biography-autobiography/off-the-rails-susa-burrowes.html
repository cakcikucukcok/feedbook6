  <title>Off the Rails - Susa Burrowes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Fifteen-year-old Hannah was a privileged young girl with a promising future, but that didn’t stop her from sliding into an abyss of sex, drugs, alcohol, and other high-risk behaviors. &lt;em&gt;Off the Rails&lt;/em&gt; narrates Hannah’s sudden decline and subsequent treatment through the raw, honest, compelling voices of Hannah and her shocked and desperate mother—each one telling her side of the story.
&lt;br&gt;
Fearing that they couldn’t keep their teen safe, Hannah’s parents made the agonizing decision to send her to her to a wilderness program, and then to residential treatment. &lt;em&gt;Off the Rails&lt;/em&gt; tells the story of the two tough years Hannah spent in three separate programs—and ponders the factors that contributed to her ultimate recovery.
&lt;br&gt;
Written for parents of teens experimenting with high-risk behaviors, as well as those trying to navigate the controversial world of teen treatment programs, &lt;em&gt;Off the Rails&lt;/em&gt; is an inspiring story of family love, determination, and the last-resort intervention that helped one troubled young woman find sobriety after a terrifying and harrowing journey." />
