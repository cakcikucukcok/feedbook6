  <title>The Odd Woman and the City - Vivian Gornick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A contentious, deeply moving ode to friendship, love, and urban life in the spirit of &lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fierce Attachments&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;A memoir of self-discovery and the dilemma of connection in our time, &lt;i&gt;The Odd Woman and the City&lt;/i&gt; explores the rhythms, chance encounters, and ever-changing friendships of urban life that forge the sensibility of a fiercely independent woman who has lived out her conflicts, not her fantasies, in a city (New York) that has done the same. Running steadily through the book is Vivian Gornick&#39;s exchange of more than twenty years with Leonard, a gay man who is sophisticated about his own unhappiness, whose friendship has &quot;shed more light on the mysterious nature of ordinary human relations than has any other intimacy&quot; she has known. The exchange between Gornick and Leonard acts as a Greek chorus to the main action of the narrator&#39;s continual engagement on the street with grocers, derelicts, and doormen; people on the bus, cross-dressers on the corner, and acquaintances by the handful. In Leonard she sees herself reflected plain; out on the street she makes sense of what she sees.&lt;br&gt;     Written as a narrative collage that includes meditative pieces on the making of a modern feminist, the role of the &lt;i&gt;flaneur &lt;/i&gt;in urban literature, and the evolution of friendship over the past two centuries, &lt;i&gt;The Odd Woman and the City &lt;/i&gt;beautifully bookends Gornick&#39;s acclaimed &lt;i&gt;Fierce Attachments&lt;/i&gt;, in which we first encountered her rich relationship with the ultimate metropolis.&lt;/p&gt;" />
