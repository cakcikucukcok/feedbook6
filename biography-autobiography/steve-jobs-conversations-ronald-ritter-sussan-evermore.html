  <title>Steve Jobs Conversations - Ronald Ritter, Sussan Evermore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I asked Steve what he would want to be remembered for in one hundred years and it wasn’t what you may expect. “I want to be remembered for placing a tool in the hands of the people and giving them the power to access all the information in the world and make a future how they want it. This is my legacy.”
Steve did not conceive the iPhone and iPad with a mandate of how to use them. He simply placed the tool into your world at the gentle stroke of a finger. It is a precious gift from a Hippie of love and enlightenment to the rest of the world.
So let us listen as Sussan allows Steve to speak through her from beyond as we ask questions that a generation would want to ask. Where did the source of the visionary come from? How did he actually conceive the idea for iPhone and iPad technology? 
He also leaves us with a future prediction for technology.
Well simply, let’s ask Steve." />
