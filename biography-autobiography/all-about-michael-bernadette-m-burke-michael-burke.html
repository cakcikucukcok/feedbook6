  <title>All About Michael - Bernadette M. Burke, Michael Burke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Author Bernadette M. Burke has always looked up to her brother, Michael.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the tender age of twenty, Michael Burke almost lost his life fighting to defend the quality of life and freedom valued by all Americans. His experiences on the field of combat in Vietnam were like that of many, yet his spirit prevailed when others crumbled. He saw his comrades die in front of him and survived a bomb attack that claimed too many of his company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through it all, he never wavered from his commitment to do the right thing. He strives to be the best father, the best husband, the best man he can be, all while struggling to conquer the many demons that would overwhelm him. The horrors of war, with its many physical and psychological scars, still plague him. He remains dedicated to serving the veterans who need him the most, and this biography honors his contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are those who are called hero because of their desire to unselfishly put whats best for others ahead of their own needs.  Michael Burke is one of these rare people. On June 14, 2011, he was inducted into the Senate Veterans Hall of Fame in Albany, New York. This honor was paid to him as a result of the work he has done throughout the years to help United States veterans and his local community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is his story, as told by one of his biggest fanshis sister.&lt;/p&gt;" />
