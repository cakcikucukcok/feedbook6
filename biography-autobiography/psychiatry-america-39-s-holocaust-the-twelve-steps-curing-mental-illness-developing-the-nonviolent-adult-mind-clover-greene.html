  <title>Psychiatry, America&#39;s Holocaust: the Twelve Steps Curing Mental Illness, Developing the Nonviolent Adult Mind - Clover Greene</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Collapsing from the grief of not being loved, twenty years old, Clover Greene was committed to psychiatry. Just as after any horror to horrible to be real, after four electric shocks, Greene developed hysterical amnesia, vaguely remembering being locked up by psychiatry.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Psychiatry, Americas Holocaust: The Twelve Steps Curing Mental Illness, Developing the Nonviolent Adult Mind chronicles author Clover Greenes journey back from the precipice of suicidal and homicidal terror. It is a collection of Greenes thoughts, original poetry, and helpful information designed to help the reader to better understand the ups and downs of recovering from mental illness.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Over a period of time, Greene was recommitted through psychiatry and forced to take drugs. Unable to escape to the outside, Greenes suppressed feelings of confusion periodically built up and exploded into suicidal and homicidal drug rages. Real doctors in real hospitals saved Greenes life from suicide attempts and the life-threatening physical
damage caused by psychiatric drugs. After thirty-one years under a psychiatrists care, Greene was incredibly still alive, saved by a twelvestep program and the support of others in the same position.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In this memoir, Greene shares the harrowing account of escaping psychiatry alive and being reborn in the spirit of love.&lt;/P&gt;" />
