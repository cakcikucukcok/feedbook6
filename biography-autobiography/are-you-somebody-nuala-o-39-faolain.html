  <title>Are You Somebody? - Nuala O&#39;Faolain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;You don&#39;t want the book to end; it glows with compassion and you want more, more because you know this is a fine wine of a life, richer as it ages.&quot;--Frank McCourt, author of &lt;i&gt;Angela&#39;s Ashes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of nine children born into a penniless North Dublin family, Nuala O&#39;Faolain was saved from a harrowing childhood by her love of books and reading. Though she ultimately became one of Ireland&#39;s best-known columnists, her professional success did little to ease her loneliness and longing for a deep connection to the world. &lt;i&gt;Are You Somebody?&lt;/i&gt; distills her experiences into a wisdom that can only come from an obstinate refusal to shrink from life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This commemorative edition of her landmark memoir celebrates O&#39;Faolain&#39;s remarkable life and work with a new foreword from Frank McCourt as well as additional archival materials. Strikingly vivid and starkly emotional, &lt;i&gt;Are You Somebody?&lt;/i&gt; is, like O&#39;Faolain herself, a singular example of courage, honesty, and bold living.&lt;/p&gt;" />
