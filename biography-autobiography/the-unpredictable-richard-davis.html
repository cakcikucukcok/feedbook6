  <title>The Unpredictable - Richard Davis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;The purpose of &lt;em&gt;The Unpredictable&lt;/em&gt; is to share personal and biographical stories and illustrations from my own experiences as well as others whose lives have been impacted by epilepsy or disorders.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Through the written word and the stroke of a brush, the old saying, A picture paints a thousand words accurately portrays the special people that have been highlighted in the pages of this book.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;At the completion of this book, my thoughts went back to what inspired me to write and paint about seizures and living with epilepsy. It was my desire to make a living as an artist and settle down in a country home with my family, living the life of an artist with a canvas and brush. However I have learned through the years that our plans are often contrary to what God has in store for us. Living with epilepsy has brought challenges and storms in life that have changed the course and direction of my life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;In this book, the experiences of life with art and epilepsy are put into paintings that I have visualized from this disease. My desire is to educate those unfamiliar with epilepsy, encourage the ones living with this disease, comfort the loved ones who support and assist those living with seizures, and open the eyes of doctors who are educated about seizures but have never experienced the challenges faced in living with a seizure disorder.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
