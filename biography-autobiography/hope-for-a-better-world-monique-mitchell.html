  <title>Hope for a Better World - Monique Mitchell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The book is basically my memoir; however, there are some fictitious characters but all is based on real events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flashback to my childhood in Madagascar: country with a fascinating history and a unique population, with ethnic characteristics in my own family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recollecting past personal tragedies in childhood and situating myself in the present where loving people( my family and church friends) are surrounding me, motivating me to be a good person and see life in a happy perspective. In particular, feeling as a great privilege to be part of the melting pot in the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recollection of the life at the Faculty of Medicine (Angers), France and the following years in Paris, graduating in social studies. Identifying the influence of the French culture as a pivotal factor in my life and grateful to Bon Papa (grandfather)who, by becoming a naturalized French citizen enabled his descendants to benefit from their French education, while identifying their difference and /or alienation, could also choose individually, how to find a balance between a dual culture they were./are exposed to (their own native and the acquired one).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting trip to the Champagne region through the wine road and to the east of France (Alsace), rich in war (WWI) memories. And there also, exhilarating history about the Statute of Liberty: designed and constructed (before being brought to the USA) by the French architect, Frdric August Bartholdi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marriage to an American business man and birth of son in 1965 but early on, had to raise her child as a single mother due insurmountable challenges in the marriage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worked for 20years for the UN in 9 countries in Africa and Asia, all called hardship posts, including those for peace-keeping missions located in politically challenged and/or war-torn countries. For each country, there is a description, besides my administrative work, of history, culture, population etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Farewell trip to Madagascar visiting the tomb of my grand parents with great sadness, fond memories and gratefulness for having raised me as a Christian child with the moral values I still carry with me at this day. Joining my American family on a permanent basis to be with my beloved son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birth of granddaughter, Jade, who is now a teenager and praying for all members of my family to be blessed by God in the country where I am now conveying my message for love and tolerance in my book Hope For a Better Work.&lt;/p&gt;" />
