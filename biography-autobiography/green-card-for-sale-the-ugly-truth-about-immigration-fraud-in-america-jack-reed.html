  <title>Green Card for Sale The Ugly Truth About Immigration Fraud in America - Jack Reed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Each year, millions of people come to the United States on temporary visas but refuse to leave, without consequence. This is a very real threat to the national security of the United States. Individuals who refuse to leave at the time their visa expires, should be subject to criminal penalties.  The 9/11 Report, concluded that a visa tracking system was essential.  This is required by law, but implementation has been blocked by Congress.  Nearly every other country in the world has both entry and exit control.  Visitors to these countries, must process both in and out of the country. During the fourteen years that I was employed by the United States Government, I experienced first-hand, the lengths that some individuals would go, to obtain a Green Card and/or Citizenship in the United States. The cases outlined in this book, are “real” cases." />
