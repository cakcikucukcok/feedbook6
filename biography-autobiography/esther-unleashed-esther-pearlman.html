  <title>Esther Unleashed - Esther Pearlman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ive worked very hard to do my own thing, begins Esther in her Introduction.
Being able to be unleashed gives me an opportunity to work my hours at my own time When inspiration comes, I can get some things done. And in Esther Unleashed! we get to follow the author on her adventures. It all begins back in modelling school (photo included), when she was preparing to make her splash in the world. We learn of her decades-long effort to complete her college education. Imagine her in wigs ala Jane Fonda (think Klute), Cher (think long and curly), and others. Empathize as she struggles to promote her art and cheer her successes. Be amused by her encounters with fame and celebrities (more photos). Get a feeling for her home life with supportive husband Marty. Travel with them and picture Esther entertaining a bus full of travellers in Europe with her singing. Plus, there are Esther-savvy tips on health and life in general, and youll even find a few delicious Tai Chi Kitchen recipes from a friend.
This book is for you if you&#39;re ready to be cheered by Esther&#39;s different take on life. She hopes that it will inspire you to become a bit more &quot;unleashed&quot; yourself!
