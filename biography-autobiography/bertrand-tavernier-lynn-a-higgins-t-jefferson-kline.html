  <title>Bertrand Tavernier - Lynn A. Higgins, T. Jefferson Kline</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bertrand Tavernier (b. 1941) is widely considered to be the leading light in a generation of French filmmakers who launched their careers in the 1970s, in the wake of the New Wave. In just over forty years, he has directed twenty-two feature films in an eclectic range of genres, from intimate family portrait to historical drama and neo-Western. Beginning with his debut feature&amp;#8212;&lt;i&gt;L&amp;#8217;Horloger de Saint-Paul&lt;/i&gt; (1974), which won the prestigious Louis Delluc prize&amp;#8212;Tavernier has shown himself to be a public intellectual. Like his films, he is deeply engaged with the pressing issues facing France and the world: the consequences of war, colonialism and its continuing aftermath, the price of heroism, and the power of art. A voracious cinephile, he is immensely knowledgeable about world cinema and American film in particular. Tavernier&amp;#8217;s roots are in Lyon, the birthplace of the cinema. He founded and presides over the Institut Lumi&amp;#232;re, which hosts retrospectives and an annual film festival in the factory where the Lumi&amp;#232;re brothers made the first films.&lt;p&gt;In this collection, containing numerous interviews translated from French and available in English for the first time, he discusses the arc of his career following in the lineage of the Lumi&amp;#232;re brothers, in that his goal, like theirs, is to &amp;#8220;show the world to the world.&amp;#8221;&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise, then, that an interview with Tavernier is a treat. Beginning with discussions of his own films, the interviews in this volume cover a vast range of topics. At the core are his thoughts about the ways cinema can inspire the imagination and contribute to the broadest possible public conversation.&lt;/p&gt;" />
