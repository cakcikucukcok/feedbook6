  <title>Ghost Dance in Berlin: A Rhapsody in Gray - Peter Wortsman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Every great city is a restless work in progress, but nowhere is the urban impulse more in flux than in Berlin, that sprawling metropolis located on the fault line of history. A short-lived fever-dream of modernity in the Roaring Twenties, redubbed Germania and primped up into the megalomaniac fantasy of a Thousand-Year Reichstadt in the Thirties, reduced in 1945 to a divided rubble heap, subsequently revived in a schizoid state of post-World War II duality, and reunited in 1989 when the wall came tumbling down &amp;#151; Berlin has since been reborn yet again as the hipster hub of the 21st century. This book is a hopscotch tour in time and space.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Part memoir, part travelogue, &lt;I&gt;Ghost Dance in Berlin&lt;/I&gt; is an unlikely declaration of love, as much to a place as to a state of mind, by the American-born son of German-speaking Jewish refugees. Peter Wortsman imagines the parallel celebratory haunting of two sets of ghosts, those of the exiled erstwhile owners, a Jewish banker and his family, and those of the F&amp;#252;hrer&amp;#8217;s Minister of Finance and his entourage, who took over title, while in another villa across the lake another gaggle of ghosts is busy planning the Final Solution.&lt;/div&gt;" />
