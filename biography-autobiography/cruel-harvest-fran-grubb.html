  <title>Cruel Harvest - Fran Grubb</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Get out here, &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, or I&#39;m gonna kill you!&quot; he hollered.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Little girls are hardwired to hold their daddies in high esteem, so it comes as a shock the first time a daughter feels the back of her daddy&#39;s hand across her face . . . or watches him punch and kick her mother to within an inch of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How could this be? Her older sisters teach her how to survive, even when he comes for her in the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A girl learns to become invisible, to look the other way, to say nothing when a curious stranger asks if she&#39;s okay. To lie. To expect nothing, not even from relatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cry without tears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To pray silently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she is fourteen, and weary, a girl begins to wish she were dead. &lt;em&gt;Cruel Harvest&lt;/em&gt; is the compelling story of how she lived instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endorsements:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;A story that seizes the reader&#39;s attention . . . the reader can&#39;t look away.&quot; ?&lt;em&gt;Publisher&#39;s Weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fran Grubb&#39;s childhood odyssey is a shatteringly dark tale of despair.&amp;nbsp; But that&#39;s not the end of her captivating life story.&amp;nbsp; Each page of &lt;em&gt;Cruel Harvest&lt;/em&gt; reveals a remarkable journey of rescue and redemption. Your heart will be moved as you witness Jesus&#39; power to deliver, forgive, reconcile, rebuild, and love.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;Denalyn and Max Lucado&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Cruel Harvest&lt;/em&gt; is an incredible story of survival and forgiveness. Fran&amp;rsquo;s ability to survive brokenness as a child and even into adulthood and then to overcome those experiences through faith and forgiveness is a true testament to the power of God&amp;rsquo;s love for each of us. Everyone can be inspired by her story.&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Sheila Walsh, author of &lt;em&gt;God Loves Broken People&lt;/em&gt; and Women of Faith speaker&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Against all odds, Fran survived her trip through the &quot;valley of the shadow of death.&quot; I loved reading this story of deliverance.&amp;nbsp;Thank you for the reminder that God can turn our mourning into dancing!&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Gracia Burnham, former hostage and author of &lt;em&gt;In the Presence of My Enemies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fran Grubb&amp;rsquo;s heartbreaking story is ultimately one of triumph against all odds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Cruel Harvest&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is well-written and riveting. It&amp;rsquo;s unimaginable that Fran could face such daily horrors and come out with such grace, wisdom, and generosity. You will be deeply moved!&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;June Cotner, author of the bestselling&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Graces&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and 26 other books, www.junecotner.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;It is hard endorsing &lt;em&gt;Cruel Harvest &lt;/em&gt;with just a few words. &amp;nbsp;I want everyone to know how powerful her story is and how many lives it can help change, and is currently changing. Ever since reading Fran Grubb&amp;rsquo;s story I have used it to help numerous clients that are victims of childhood violence. Every woman has commented on her faith and how her book has given them hope!&amp;nbsp; We are putting the book in our library for all the ladies to read.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;Vicki Mason, Primary Crisis Interventionist, Women&#39;s Crisis Services of LeFlore County, Poteau, Oklahoma&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This was a wonderful book. We could feel the faith of the child throughout every page. We highly recommend &lt;em&gt;Cruel Harvest&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;DeWayne and Rebecca Hicks, Founders of Courage to Change Ministries, Greenville, Arkansas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;Cruel Harvest&lt;/em&gt; will touch your heart clear through to your soul!&amp;nbsp; I guarantee that you won&#39;t be disappointed and you won&#39;t be able to put it down.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash;Pastor Ray Witherington, Midnight Cry Ministries / Restoration Revival Center Church, Townville, South Carolina&lt;/p&gt;
