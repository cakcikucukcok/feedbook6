  <title>The Captain of the Juniper - Wayne F. Beyea</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Brooklyn-born Frank F. Pabst, inspired by a strong desire for independence, excitement, and prosperity, began working as a crewman on a river ship at age eleven, converted a sunken ship&#39;s pilothouse into a teenage clubhouse, and plunged into the hold of a sunken tea schooner at the age of thirteen. As part of his love affair with Lake Champlain, Pabst then captained the tour boat Juniper for twenty-five years.&lt;p&gt; 
During the course of those twenty-five years, thousands of visitors boarded a vessel more resembling a stout and sturdy tugboat than a pleasure cruise to be greeted by the words, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard the &lt;i&gt;Juniper&lt;/i&gt;.&quot;  Pabst conveyed a great love for the lake and shared his vast knowledge of the lake&#39;s history, including tales of the unsolved mystery of whether a dinosaur-like creature referred to as &quot;Champ&quot;, or &quot;Champy,&quot; dwells within the lake&#39;s depths. Many of them fondly remember their scenic, breathtakingly beautiful cruises with Pabst.&lt;p&gt;
So embark with &lt;i&gt;The Captain of the Juniper&lt;/i&gt; on a cruise through the life of a simple man who, through his devotion to the lake, became one of the most beloved and legendary characters in the history of Lake Champlain.&lt;p&gt;" />
