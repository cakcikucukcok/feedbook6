  <title>The Mzuzu House - Gene Meacham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;David Montgomery is a missionary who has just made the difficult decision to uproot his family once again and move into an uncertain situation in the remote northern region of Malawi, East Africa. As he gathers his family and heads to Mzuzu, David realizes his challenges are just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;David, who has reluctantly ignored his hearts calling to serve in a more urban setting, struggles to find fulfillment as a bush missionary and wonders whether his new mission is truly Gods will. While he tackles the formidable task of building a missionary residence for his family, he must battle army ants, malaria, and seemingly endless frustrations. In the meantime, his wife, Katherine, homeschools their three daughters and teaches religious instruction at a nearby girls school. Not to be deterred, David finally completes the housejust before his family leaves for furlough. After they return to the States, David and Katherine pray earnestly for Gods guidance as they contemplate whether they should return to Mzuzu. But as a health scare looms, they have no idea that God is about to answer their prayers in a way they never imagined.
Based on true events, The Mzuzu House shares the continuing, heartwarming, and at times amusing tale of a missionary familys African adventure as they serve God in a faraway land.&lt;/p&gt;" />
