  <title>Girl Logic - Iliza Shlesinger, Mayim Bialik</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;From breakout stand-up comedian Iliza Shlesinger comes a subversively funny collection of essays and observations on the secret genius of irrational behavior.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Have you ever been pissed because you&#39;re not pretty enough, and then gotten even more pissed that someone didn&#39;t find you as pretty as you think you are? Have you ever obsessed over the size of your thighs while eating dessert, all the while saying you&#39;ll work out extra tomorrow? Or spent endless hours wondering why you have to bear the brunt of other people&#39;s insecurities? I mean, after all, I&#39;m pretty great. Why cope with insecurities I don&#39;t already have?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That last one&#39;s just me? All right, then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But if the rest sounds familiar, you are experiencing Girl Logic: a characteristically female way of thinking that appears contradictory and circuitous but is actually a complicated and highly evolved way of looking at the world. You end up considering every repercussion of every choice (about dating, career, clothes, lunch) before making a move toward what you really want. And why do we attempt these mental hurdles? Well, that&#39;s what this book is all about.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The fact is, whether you&#39;re obsessing over his last text or the most important meeting of your career, your Girl Logic serves a  purpose: It helps push you, question what you want, and clarify what will make you a happier, better person. Girl Logic can be every confident woman&#39;s secret weapon, and this book shows you how to wield it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
