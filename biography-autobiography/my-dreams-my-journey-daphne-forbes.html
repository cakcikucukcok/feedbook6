  <title>My Dreams My Journey - Daphne Forbes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Daphne was the tenth of fourteen children, born into a loving Christian family in 1940s Jamaica.  Although a delicate child, she was happy and had lots of fun with her siblings in their idyllic rural home.  She was ambitious, and dreamed of becoming a doctor, and eventually to have a happy fulfilled family life of her own.
Things started to go wrong when she became ill at the age of fourteen.  She later became an unwed mother, to the disappointment of her family and church.  She could no longer stay at home as her situation and desires had changed.  This forced her to leave Jamaica and move to England in the winter of 1961, where she married her sons father.  Married life was far from what she expected ... 
The reality of life in England was hard for her to adjust to.  She encountered racism at work, and illness in the family.  In 1964, with the help and encouragement of her brother, she was introduced to the New Testament Church of God, where she received the Lord Jesus Christ into her life.   
Daphne decided to return to Jamaica later in life, but that decision was not without its challenges. She had changed, and so had Jamaica. 
She shares some interesting, amazing and challenging experiences and dreams from her journey through life.
Go home to thy friends, and tell them what great things the Lord hath done for thee ... (Mark 5:19)." />
