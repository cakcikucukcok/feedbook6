      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Audrey Wilson was born in England and grew up in the twenties in the country and London when milk was still delivered in bottles by pony and cart. She was bombed out in the Blitz of l940 and spent four months in a public shelter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She joined the Womens Royal Naval Service, W.R N.S., and, after training as a radio technician, was assigned to MI-5 to listen to German U-boat communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the invasion in l944 she was sent to London to translate captured German documents at the time of the V1 and V2 rocket bombs. After the war she married an American musician who taught piano at FSU Music School.&lt;/p&gt;
