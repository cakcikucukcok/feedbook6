  <title>Heroes from the Wall - John Douglas Foster</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When the author John Douglas Foster was wounded while serving in Vietnam during the 1968 Tet Offensive, he received more than a piece of metal in his body--  haunting memories of comrades opened his soul in a quest to learn more about those who didnt return. Sketching a fascinating portrait of the lives of those who fought and died valiantly, Foster pens a riveting and gut-wrenching read in Heroes from the Wall. 
A clear-eyed tale of truly honorable individuals who were not just mere names, numbers and statistics, Heroes from the Wall ensures that these unsung heroes will never be forgotten by future generations who didnt know them on the battlefield. Foster seamlessly captures their quirks of personality, playful antics, heroic actions, compassion and care for others, their caring and sharing with their comrades, tender concern for their family, and affirmation of life while engulfed in places of death. Leaving readers with a newfound respect for the nameless heroes upon turning the pages, Foster writes with candor and resonating tone." />
