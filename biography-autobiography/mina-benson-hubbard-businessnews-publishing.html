      <meta name="description" content="This work offers a summary of the book “HOW TO SUCCEED IN BUSINESS WITHOUT WORKING SO DAMN HARD: Rethinking the Rules, Reinventing the Game” by Robert Kriegel. &lt;br&gt;Kriegal’s work is based on one simple, persuasive premise: work better, not harder. It’s possible to be more productive, create more profit and be happier by working less hours, but in a more directed way. Kriegel takes this principle and splits it into two guidelines: don’t conform, but rethink the way you work, and don’t compete against others. &lt;br&gt;His book breaks down these principles into measures that every businessperson can apply. Exploit your strengths, for example, rather than trying to solve your weaknesses; make a serious effort to halve your number of meetings; look at business ideas outside of your industry, and think how they could be applied. In short, look carefully at your market’s assumptions, and your personal ones, and challenge whether they are effective, could be done more quickly, or need to be done at all. As Kriegel says, “The American ethic is also one of a pioneering spirit, of exploring new territory, and of taking the path less trod. It is one of creating change, rather than responding to market shifts and new opportunities, and of being out in front of the wave, rather than trying to keep up.”&lt;br&gt;" />
