  <title>Bitter Sweet - Al Duhan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;After escaping from a tortured childhood in Connecticut, I left home at a young age and traveled to California. The torture had followed me where ever I went.   There was a battle between the officer and I but was able to escape.  I was captured and incarcerated for the robbery that I had no knowledge of.  While I was serving a two year sentence, my fiance Bonnie, was raped and became pregnant with his child. She pleaded for me to stay, but not having employment, I must return to Connecticut.  We were talking about her baby and I told her I could still love you but I could never love the baby.  Then I heard strange noises. She was punching her stomach and screaming, I will kill it I will kill it for you.  I screamed back at her I had nothing to do with this.  But I knew I should have never said that.  Then I had a nightmare, that I went back to California to see Bonnie, I was able to see that she was lying with her hand in a large pool of blood, Why God, Why her!  Was this a Paranormal Migration.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The story that you are about to read has been compared with novels as Love Story &amp; Splendor in the grass. But has much more excitement and nerve racking moments.  Features Love, Rape Murder and false imprisonment and is a must read for all people entering their road to life.&lt;/P&gt;" />
