  <title>All the Pain and Suffering Made Me Stronger - Cruz Pati単o</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book narrates a story of a woman who has suffered from childhood. After the death of her father, she felt that her life will never be the same again. Since a child, she suffered domestic violence and discrimination. She was raped at the age of 10 and after having a baby, she suffered painful criticisms from some relatives. Desperate enough, she left her country; her son was barely a year old and went searching for the American dream. 
After suffering psychological and physical abuse from her own brother, she decided to welcome and start a relationship, hoping it will change her thinking about life. However, that relationship turned to hell. She loves her children the most so she had to work to be able to sustain their needs. Even to the extent of risking her health, she finds way to survive and be a mother to her kids. She wants the best for her children and be able to give them a normal family. 
She found a new relationship. After a time, what appeared to be a perfect relationship was changed by infidelity. 
Death was the only perfect solution. We need to trust God even during the most difficult times. This is a story of inspiration and struggle for life and dreams.  Take a time to reflect. You control your own future. You decide for your own struggles, its either you give up or you move forward. 
I decided to get up and go forward you decide yours." />
