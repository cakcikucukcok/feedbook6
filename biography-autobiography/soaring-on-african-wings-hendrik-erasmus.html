  <title>Soaring on African Wings - Hendrik Erasmus</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;The prologue of this autobiography gives an idea of the flowing, almost esoteric, prose and original poetry which surfaces throughout the story.
&lt;P&gt;A highly authentic and richly textured account is given of life as a white English- speaking youngster raised in rural South Africa during the 1960&#39;s and 1970&#39;s.
A vivid account is given of life in the military, duty in the jungles of the Caprivi on the Zambesi river and political awareness attained at Law School. Employment as a banker,salesman, cabdriver, wine-maker, goldminer, labourer, legal man. Surviving encounters with knifemen, wild animals and beautiful women.
The South American diary chronicles an extraordinary backpacking/cycling saga, taking the reader from the jungles of the Amazon into the lives of the vibrant South American people in the raw 1980&#39;s.
&lt;P&gt;Travelling, teaching English and experiencing the rich cultures of Greece, South Korea, and Thailand. Unforgettable experiences in Laos and the Philippines. Near death in Taiwan.
There is true depth and honesty in the writing which is easy to read and digest,  with real humour and pathos presented in the telling. The strong friendships that are formed, and the life lessons that are learned, are presented with love for the people and increasing self-knowledge.
&lt;P&gt;The writer keeps the reader entranced by skillfully juxtaposing different periods in time, thereby establishing a theme of motion which never lets up." />
