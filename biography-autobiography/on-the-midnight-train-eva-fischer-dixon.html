  <title>On the Midnight Train - Eva Fischer-Dixon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If I could have a dollar for each time I heard the following questions: I detected an accent, where are you from? or How did you come to the United States or Refugee camp? You were really in a refugee camp? among other questions, I could have paid for a house in full from that money. Ever since I could remember I always wanted to come to the United States. This country was not just a dream for me; it was a reality that I wanted to accomplish before I reached age 25. The decision was easy knowing what I wanted since age 11, but leaving elderly parents behind was very difficult. However, I had parents who understood that I could not accomplish what I wanted to be, to become a writer in a country where if you were not a member of the Communist Party, your chances for success was minimal. I wanted to write things that did not please those who was part of the Communist Inquisition. I dared to escape from the poverty, the hypocrisy and oppression that were all around us. I was willing to pay the price of isolation, starvation or anything that would help me to come to America. And this is my story." />
