      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From former &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt; magazine&amp;#8217;s celebrity interviewer George Wayne comes a collection of piquant, poignant, and nostalgic interviews with some of the iconic personalities of our time, curated from his legendary magazine career.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man behind some of the most notorious celebrity interviews, George Wayne, has redefined, reimagined, and remastered the modern art of the conversation. For over twenty years, he documented pop culture with the George Wayne Questionnaire, his patented question and answer column, which has been one of &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8217;s most iconic and intriguing features. In each issue, he posed a series of offbeat questions to some the most captivating people in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refreshingly unafraid to ask anything and everything, GW has perfected what he calls&amp;#8212;the probe and parry&amp;#8212;to break down protective facades and get inside the heads and hearts of his interviewees. The results have been humorous, often surprising, sometimes shocking, and always revealing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beautifully designed with illustrations, &lt;em&gt;Anyone Who&amp;#8217;s Anyone&lt;/em&gt; is a collection of some of his most fascinating conversations with the world&amp;#8217;s famous and infamous, highlighted with introductory annotations and memories of each interview&amp;#8212;first published in his own &lt;em&gt;R.O.M.E., Vanity Fair,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Daily Front Row&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cultural icons, royalty, and superstars of all kinds&amp;#8212;including Kate Moss, Ivanka Trump, Ivana Trump, Martha Stewart, Joan Rivers, Farrah Fawcett, Fabio, Graydon Carter, and many more&amp;#8212;spill their secrets, candidly sharing their hopes and fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With social media increasingly dominating our personal interactions, &lt;em&gt;Anyone Who&amp;#8217;s Anyone&lt;/em&gt; demonstrates that nothing can replace an engaging and authentic t&amp;#234;te-&amp;#224;-t&amp;#234;te.&lt;/p&gt;" />
