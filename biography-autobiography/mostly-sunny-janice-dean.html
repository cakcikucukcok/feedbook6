  <title>Mostly Sunny - Janice Dean</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestseller.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sometimes you have to make your own sunshine.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Janice Dean debuted on &lt;em&gt;Imus in the Morning&lt;/em&gt;, she was bubbly, clever, and charismatic. When Imus mocked her intelligence and looks, she gave as good as she got. She had achieved the dream she&amp;#8217;d had since kindergarten: being a reporter on TV.&amp;#160;So why wasn&amp;#8217;t she happy?&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had just moved to New York from Canada with no family, no friends, and no boyfriend. Her boss was a notorious jerk, and the gap between her on-air persona and real life had never been bigger. In the decade that followed, how did she turn it all around?&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now she is the beloved full-time meteorologist on &lt;em&gt;Fox and Friends&lt;/em&gt;, surrounded by wonderful people, and has a line of children&amp;#8217;s books and a beautiful family.

She knows how love, counting your blessings, and having a good therapist can get you through more than you would expect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this honest yet optimistic book, Janice reveals obstacles she&amp;#8217;s faced that could have severely impacted any professional woman&amp;#8217;s career, from online trolls to health issues to abusive and sexist bosses.&amp;#160;In &lt;em&gt;Mostly Sunny&lt;/em&gt; she talks about it all, including the fateful meeting with her firefighting husband after he lost his colleagues on 9/11 and how the pressure on women in television led her to a cosmetic procedure that could have ended her career.&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160;&amp;#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But no matter what storms blow her way, Janice refuses to let setbacks and challenges rain on her parade or cloud her outlook. Thanks to supportive coworkers and an upbeat attitude, she&amp;#8217;s mastered turning countless would-be losses into victories. The funny, sweet, and wise Janice Dean you see on TV is now the real Janice Dean, and she&amp;#8217;s on every page of her book, sharing her secrets and making your own forecast a little brighter.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;" />
