  <title>Things I Know or Think I Know or Thought I Knew or Who Knows? - Arthur L. Sterne</title>
      <meta name="description" content="What impressed me most...are the intricate and artistic detail with which Art describes the settings and the depth and sensitivity of the emotions expressed in each memoir.&lt;br&gt; 
Reba Boyd Wooden, Executive Director, Center for Inquiry, Indiana&lt;p&gt; 
A retired psychologist shares over eighty poignant, humorous, and entertaining memoirs highlighting his life, from his birth at home in Hudson Falls, New York, to his current experiences as a widower and freethinker.&lt;p&gt; 
Arthur L. Sterne, Ph.D. has spent his life curious about people and as a result, many of his memoirs reflect his power of keen observation and wonderful sense of humor. His compilation of anecdotes begins with his early life in Jacksonville, Florida, then with his experiences at Vanderbilt University where he met Ann, a nursing student who stole his heart and later became his wife of forty-four years, and continues in Indianapolis, where he once saw Judy Garland and Marlene Dietrich perform. As he moves through the retelling of his favorite memories, Sterne covers such relatable topics as politics, religion, aging, and rebuilding a life after the death of a spouse. In Things I Know or Think I Know or Thought I Knew or Who Knows? Sterne encourages others to think, pose questions and look for answers, ultimately viewing the world in a new light." />
