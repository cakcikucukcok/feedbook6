  <title>A Promise to Ourselves - Alec Baldwin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&quot;I have been through some of the worst of contentious divorce litigation,&quot; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alec&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Baldwin&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; declares in &lt;/i&gt;A Promise to Ourselves.&lt;i&gt; Using a very personal approach, he offers practical guidance to help others avoid the anguish he has endured.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;An Academy and Tony Award nominee and a 2007 recipient of Golden Globe, SAG, and Television Critics Association Awards for best actor in a comedy, Alec Baldwin is one of the best-known, most successful actors in the world. His relationship with Kim Basinger, the Academy Award-winning actress, lasted nearly a decade. They have a daughter named Ireland, and for a time, theirs seemed to be the model of a successful Hollywood marriage. But in 2000 they separated and in 2002 divorced. Their split---specifically the custody battle surrounding Ireland---would be the subject of media attention for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his own life and others&#39;, Baldwin has seen the heavy toll that divorce can take---psychologically, emotionally, and financially. He has been extensively involved in divorce litigation, and he has witnessed the way that noncustodial parents, especially fathers, are often forced to abandon hopes of equitable rights when it comes to their children. He makes a powerful case for reexamining and changing the way divorce and child custody is decided in this country and levels a scathing attack at what he calls the &quot;family law industry.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to his experiences with judges, court-appointed therapists, and lawyers, Baldwin pulls no punches. He casts a light on his own divorce and the way the current family law system affected him, his ex-wife, and his daughter, as well as many other families. This is an important, informative, and deeply felt book on a contentious subject that offers hope of finding a better way.&lt;/p&gt;" />
