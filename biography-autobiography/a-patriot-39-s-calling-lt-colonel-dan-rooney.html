  <title>A Patriot&#39;s Calling - Lt Colonel Dan Rooney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A decorated fighter pilot and PGA professional tells the story of his life and service&amp;#8212;to both his nation and others&amp;#8212;in this remarkable memoir that is a stirring record of faith, patriotism, family, philanthropy, and golf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;What does it mean to be a patriot? For Oklahoma native Dan Rooney, it is someone who not only puts his life on the line for country, but who opens his heart and mind and seeks to build a life that embodies the purest and most concentrated essence of himself. For many, Rooney is the model of a patriot: as an Air Force pilot who deployed to Iraq, serving three tours of duty; as a professional golfer who established a nonprofit foundation awarding thousands of scholarships to the children of fallen and disabled veterans; as the father of five daughters; as a man of faith, whose copilot, both in the skies and on the ground, has always been God. &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Patriot&amp;#8217;s Calling&lt;/em&gt; is his autobiographical journey through some of the most character-defining moments of his awe-inducing life and career. &amp;#8220;On my third tour of duty in Iraq as F -16 fighter pilot, I felt a powerful calling from God to share the miraculous fusion of people and experiences uniquely placed along my journey. During my reflection, I began to understand how the forces of synchronicity had shaped my life. Synchronicity, or, as I like to call it, &amp;#8216;chance with a purpose,&amp;#8217; is all around us. These encounters with God&amp;#8217;s messengers are the sign-posts along the road of life guiding us toward our essence.&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;A Patriot&amp;#8217;s Calling&lt;/em&gt; illuminates Rooney&amp;#8217;s true essence&amp;#8212;and offers guidance and inspiration for us all. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Patriot&amp;#8217;s&amp;#160;Calling&lt;/em&gt; includes 40 photos and 3 maps. &lt;/p&gt;" />
