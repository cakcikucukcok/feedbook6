  <title>The Bees - Carol Ann Duffy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A winner of the Costa Book Award, &quot;beautiful and moving poetry for the real world&quot; (&lt;i&gt;The Guardian&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Bees &lt;/i&gt;is Carol Ann Duffy&#39;s first collection of new poems as British poet laureate, and the much anticipated successor to the T. S. Eliot Prize-winning &lt;i&gt;Rapture&lt;/i&gt;. After the intimate focus of the earlier book, &lt;i&gt;The Bees &lt;/i&gt;finds Duffy using her full poetic range: there are drinking songs, love poems, poems to the weather, and poems of political anger. There are elegies, too, for beloved friends and--most movingly--for the poet&#39;s mother. As Duffy&#39;s voice rises in this collection, her music intensifies, and every poem patterns itself into song.&lt;br&gt;     Woven into and weaving through the book is its presiding spirit: the bee. Sometimes the bee is Duffy&#39;s subject, sometimes it strays into the poem or hovers at its edge--and the reader soon begins to anticipate its appearance. In the end, Duffy&#39;s point is clear: the bee symbolizes what we have left of grace in the world, and what is most precious and necessary for us to protect. &lt;i&gt;The Bees &lt;/i&gt;is Duffy&#39;s clearest affirmation yet of her belief in the poem as &quot;secular prayer,&quot; as the means by which we remind ourselves of what is most worthy of our attention and concern, our passion and our praise.&lt;/p&gt;" />
