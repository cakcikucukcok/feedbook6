  <title>Sugar, Bananas and Some Sweet Sugar Cane - Caren Williams Marriott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Throughout my life I was faced with many trials,
as a child and as an adult. Being brought up in a third
world country was nothing easy and especially living in
the most remote part of Jamaica. It was not easy going
to sleep hungry or not knowing where the next meal was
coming from. I was faced with these struggles on a day to
day basis. Moving out on my own and dealing with the
real world on my own was a challenge, and getting pregnant at a young age turned
out to be a struggle as well. Being nave I was easily taking advantage by people
and getting hurt by people that I trusted. Throughout this book I explain how I
experienced more pain then anyone could ever endure. In my life I experienced
so many twists and turns and although most of them went away I was always left
with a feeling of disappointment with myself and others. Accidents and mistakes
became permanent damages. I had to live with these mistakes it made me into a
better person that I am today. It wasnt easy going through the things that I went
through, but these were the obstacles that I had to go through as life lessons. I
know people that are out there that think that they cant make it, but I wrote this
book to let them know that it is possible to get through any obstacles that they
think they cant get through. With God and time anything is possible and I just
want to share my life experience with them. I wrote this book as an inspiration to
all the women and single mothers that dont have anyone and is still going through
the trials and is about to give up hope on life. I just want them to keep their head
up and have faith in God because He will come through in the end, it might not
look like it now, but He will come through. Think about this when a student is
taking a test the teacher is absent, just like when you are going through something
God might seem to be absent during the test but he is not. Think about it God will
pull through but you need to have faith and understand that He will never leave
nor forsake you." />
