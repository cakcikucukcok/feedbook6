  <title>A Mug Up with Elisabeth - Melissa Hayes, Marilyn Westervelt</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Anyone who has come under the spell of Elisabeth Ogilvie&amp;#39;s novels to bound to wonder about this writer who, for more than fifty years, has crafted one memorable book after another: historical fiction, mysteries, young adult stories, even a gothic novel. Most are set in Maine or the Scottish Highlands, and for many readers it is Ogilvie&amp;#39;s beautifully realized settings that make them pick up her novels again and again. Equally fascinating are her characters: vivid, individual, appealingly imperfect, deeply rooted in their families and home ground.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now, at last, we have a book about this prolific yet unassuming author who would rather live quietly on her Maine island than seek the limelight. A Mug-Up with Elisabeth is the definitive resource on her life, her work, her characters, and her settings--including Criehaven, the inspiration for Bennett&amp;#39;s Island, which is arguably one of the most evocative locales in American fiction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;On Bennett&amp;#39;s Island, many a tale is told and many a crisis resolved around the kitchen table while the islanders pause for a &amp;quot;mug-up&amp;quot; of coffee. In these pages, readers can enjoy a mug-up with Elisabeth Ogilvie herself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
