  <title>Kidnapped - Lorna Greyling</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When twenty five rebels descended on Nick and violently pushed him into a car, he knew that he might not see the end of the day. Guns were fired and people fell, screams filled the air.
The threats of the rebels on her cellphone: Pick a coffin.  Were sending him back to you in a coffin, continued to echo through her mind. Nicks messages broke her heart over and over. Please help me! They are going to shoot me!
The negotiators were involved in a cat and mouse game over the ransom for her husbands life. Her home was full of people who brought food and offered encouragement.  It was unreal.  Fear wanted to devour her alive.
The only thing Lorna Greyling could hold onto was Gods Word texted to her by a friend the same morning her husband was kidnapped on a business trip in Nigeria.
Psalm 91
He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.  I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust.   For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways;
Nothing will happen to your family, her friend added.
The whole day I had to make choices. Do I rely on the facts or on Gods Word?
KIDNAPPED is a powerful testimony of the Lord who honoured his Word in the darkest hour of the Greylings. It is a narrative of Gods provision when a positive outcome seemed impossible; of the Fathers appearance in word and deed to carry his children through a devastating storm." />
