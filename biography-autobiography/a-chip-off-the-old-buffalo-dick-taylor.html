Capturing Taylors memories of his youth being part of the football culture as it existed back then, A Chip Off The Old Buffalo is an interesting autobiographical account where he shares on CUs previous success in football and how it fell apart. CU went from defeating Oklahoma, winning the Big Eight Championship, going to the Orange Bowl, and being rated seventh in the nation to firing all of the coaches, losing forty-plus players, being placed on probation for two years, and no games on TV." />
