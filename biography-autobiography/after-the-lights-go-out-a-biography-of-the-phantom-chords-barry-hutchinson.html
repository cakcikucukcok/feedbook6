  <title>After the Lights Go Out: A Biography of the Phantom Chords - Barry Hutchinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1989, David Vanian - vocalist with UK Punk band The Damned quit to form a new band, taking with him fellow band members Roman Jugg and Bryn Merrick. The Phantom Chords was born. Playing a mix of covers and original music co-written by Vanian and Jugg, the music was inspired by a shared love of &#39;30s, &#39;40s and &#39;50s film music, merged with &#39;60s seven-piece, twangy guitar bands and jazzy rock &#39;n&#39; roll instrumentals. For the first time, this book tells the fascinating story of Dave Vanian&#39;s beloved project The Phantom Chords. The story begins in 1983 with Vanian&#39;s solo career, and covers the Naz Nomad &amp; The Nightmares side-project and his involvement in The Damned. From 1990 to 2003 The Phantom Chords recorded three full-length albums and two singles, toured up and down the UK and found audiences in Europe and the USA." />
