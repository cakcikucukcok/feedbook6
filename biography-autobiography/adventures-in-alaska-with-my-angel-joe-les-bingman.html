  <title>Adventures in Alaska with My Angel Joe - Les Bingman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Miracles happen around us every daysome can be small and maybe even unrecognizable, while other miracles can save our lives. But whether its a little personal epiphany or a lifesaving moment during a near-death experience, so many of us throughout our lives credit these moments and experiences to luck, never giving credit where credits due. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In Adventures in Alaska with My Angel Joe, author Les Bingman shares the true-life stories of his near-death experiences while growing up in bush Alaskaand how a guardian angel, Joe, saved him at each step along the way. Raised in the shadows of some of the best bush pilots and commercial salmon fishermen in Bristol Bay, the young Les tries to mimic these men he grew up idolizing. This proves harder than he imagines, and as he repeatedly finds himself in potentially deadly situations involving airplanes and boats because of his naivety, he finally begins to recognize the feelings and signals that can only be from his own personal guardian angel, who he eventually names Joe. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
From out on the ocean to up in the sky, Less guardian angel Joe is always there in ways both subtle and obvious, protecting Les from his own reckless ways. Experience the highs and lows and ups and downs of an Alaskan life spent chasing a dream, and reflect on those subtle miracles in your lifeand with Gods help, you can start to realize that you are never truly alone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
