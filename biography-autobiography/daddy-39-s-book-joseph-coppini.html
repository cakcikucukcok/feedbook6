  <title>Daddy&#39;s Book - Joseph Coppini</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is how the story begins, it was a Wednesday night and I went to a dance every Wednesday night at the P.S. Pavilion; a nice big dance hall like the big ones we had in Chicago, with the big bands. I felt like I was about 18 years old and I danced every dance. I had a few drinks and I left the dance about 11 :00 P.M. I got to bed about 11:45 p.m.  I woke up about 5 a.m the next morning. I couldn&#39;t breathe, I was having a tough time breathing; so I called 911. I knew I was in some kind of trouble so I took my pajamas off, put on shorts and with that I put my medicare card and blue cross/blue shield card, and my driver&#39;s license in my pocket I waited out side. It seemed  like an hour but it was probably only a few minutes, before the fire dept arrived with their wagon. I was standing in the driveway, waiting for them to arrive. I said, &quot;I&#39;m having a hard time breathing would you please give me some oxygen.&quot;  They kept asking, what&#39;s your name, . . .where do you live? I kept asking them to please give me some oxygen.  I was having a tough time breathing." />
