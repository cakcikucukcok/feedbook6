  <title>A Hope More Powerful Than the Sea: The Journey of Doaa Al Zamel - Melissa Fleming</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Urgently required reading.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;--&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;People&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Deeply affecting... Fleming brings a moral urgency to the narrative.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Fleming deftly illustrates the pain of those who choose to leave Syria...and her book is ultimately a story of hope.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;Newsweek&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Adrift in a frigid sea, no land in sight, just debris from the ship&#39;s wreckage and floating corpses all around, nineteen-year-old Doaa Al Zamel stays afloat on a small inflatable ring and clutches two little girls--barely toddlers--to her body. The children had been thrust into Doaa&#39;s arms by their drowning relatives, all refugees who boarded a dangerously overcrowded ship bound for Italy and a new life. For days as Doaa drifts, she prays for rescue and sings to the babies in her arms. She must stay alive for them. She must not lose hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Hope More Powerful Than the Sea &lt;/i&gt;chronicles the life of Doaa, a Syrian girl whose life was upended in 2011 by the onset of her country&#39;s brutal civil war. Doaa and her fiance, Bassem, decide to flee to Europe to seek safety and an education, but four days after setting sail on a smuggler&#39;s dilapidated fishing vessel along with five hundred other refugees, their boat is struck and begins to sink. This is the moment when Doaa&#39;s struggle for survival really begins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This emotionally charged, eye-opening true story that represents the millions of unheard voices of refugees who risk everything in a desperate search for the promise of a safe future. In the midst of the most pressing international humanitarian crisis of our time, Melissa Fleming paints a vivid, unforgettable portrait of the triiumph of the human spirit.&lt;/p&gt;" />
