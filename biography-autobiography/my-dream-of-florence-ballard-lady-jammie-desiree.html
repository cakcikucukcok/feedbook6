  <title>My Dream of Florence Ballard - Lady jammie Desiree</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Dream of Florence Ballard: A Detroit Rose was developed from my mom telling me all these wonderful stories of Motown music in the 1960s. She remembered Florence Ballard when she lived in Detroit. I would ask my mom about it when I was a child growing up. I would say, Mom, please tell me the stories of Florence Ballard, and my mom would say, Oh, you want to hear another Flo story. Flo was Florence Ballards nickname. It is short for Florence. My mom would light up her cigarette and tell me such beautiful stories of Florence Ballard. I would be mesmerized by her stories. From my moms stories, I dreamed of meeting Florence Ballard. And upon waking up from my dream, I wrote my dream of Florence Ballard.
It is a fiction story written for all genders and all ages. This book is full of entertainment and original songs I wrote. It takes place in Detroit, Michigan, during the 1960s. The story takes you into a dream of watching Florence grow again, and we get to watch her revolve again. In this story, Florence Ballard is a shining star. Her life and music lives on forevermore." />
