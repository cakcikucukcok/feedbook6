  <title>Ocean - Ali Rahimbakhsh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There is a part of the book that involves biography and my researches about the spirit.
From childhood, by the permission of the Lord of the worlds, an endowment has been given to me that without voluntary will, the soul gets separated from my body.
I who was only a child, with the thanks of God and the help of pure souls and after rather a long time, I was able to make this act voluntary and perform it completely.
Regarding the fact that the psychology science and paranormal science include many sciences, gradually I found out some cases that include connection to souls, characteristics, and attentions related to them.
I always want to share the beautiful, lovely and valuable evolving experiences of human to other people to participate all with infinite love to God in the joy of its conduction.
I believe that the world after death exists doubtlessly and with the practices of this book the power of body and soul concentration can be nurtured and besides doing soul OBE, the soul can travel to unimaginable places by other ways which named mental travels.
If the body has five physical/materialist senses, the spirit has numerous senses and traits. Among them, we can refer to moving objects from distance, transmission of love and kindness and healing through spiritual halo and record of all events of life in soul browser and visibility of world by any part of the soul.
Therefore, my main request of writing this book and other books is to transfer my more than fifty-year experiences to other people by this way whom I love them with heart and soul and make them pleasure and cheerful." />
