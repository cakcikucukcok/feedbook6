  <title>The Artpeace Project - Pj Keeley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Thomas Jefferson chose the words all men are created equal--not all men are born free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He and the other Founders desired that everyone have freedom and not be subject to another regarding their life, liberty, or even their pursuit of happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today our nation is divided on the subject of life, and many believe that an unborn fetus can have its life decided by another. PJ Keeley, a father of four and a pro-life advocate, explains why it needs to be removed from society, public schools, and the USA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He reveals how he discovered an organization called 40 Days for Life, why he joined their peaceful, prayer vigils. Follow his spirit-led creation of youth engaging, non-judge-mental, non-ugly, pro life art campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read about divine intervention, the NFL miracle, a discussion with an abortion doctor, pro-choice, and customers of abortion. Read hundreds of positive life testimonials! Join The ArtPeace Project, get this book and give the peace of Jesus (Jn 14:27) to all!&lt;/p&gt;" />
