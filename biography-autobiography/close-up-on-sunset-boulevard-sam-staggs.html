  <title>Close-up on Sunset Boulevard - Sam Staggs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Billy Wilder&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Sunset Boulevard&lt;/i&gt;, a classic film noir and also a damning dissection of the Hollywood dream factory, evokes the glamour and ruin of the stars who subsist on that dream.  It&#39;s also one long in-joke about the movie industry and those who made it great-and who were, in turn, destroyed by it.  One of the most critically admired films of the twentieth century, &lt;i&gt;Sunset Boulevard&lt;/i&gt; is also famous as silent star Gloria Swanson&#39;s comeback picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sam Staggs&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Close-Up On Sunset Boulevard&lt;/i&gt; tells the story of this extravagant work, from the writing, casting and filming to the disastrous previews that made Paramount consider shelving it.  It&#39;s about the writing team of Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett-sardonically called &quot;the happiest couple in Hollywood&quot;-and their raucous professional relationship.  It&#39;s about the art direction and the sets, the costumes, the props, the lights and the cameras, and the personalities who used those tools to create a cinematic work of art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs goes behind the scenes to reveal: William Holden, endlessly attacked by his bitter wife and already drinking too much; Nancy Olson, the cheerful ingenue who had never heard of the great Gloria Swanson; the dark genius Erich von Stroheim; the once famous but long-forgotten &quot;Waxworks&quot;; and of course Swanson herself, who-just like Norma Desmond-had once been &quot;the greatest star of them all.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the story of &lt;i&gt;Sunset Boulevard&lt;/i&gt; doesn&#39;t end with the movie&#39;s success and acclaim at its release in 1950. There&#39;s much more, and Staggs layers this stylish book with fascinating detail, following the actors and Wilder into their post-&lt;i&gt;Sunset&lt;/i&gt; careers and revealing Gloria Swanson&#39;s never-ending struggle to free herself from the clutches of Norma Desmond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Close-Up On Sunset Boulevard&lt;/i&gt; also chronicles the making of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#39;s musical production of &lt;i&gt;Sunset Boulevard&lt;/i&gt; and the explosive diva controversies that dogged it. The book ends with a shocking example of Hollywood life imitating Hollywood art. By the last page of this rich narrative, readers will conclude: We are those &quot;wonderful people out there in the dark.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;" />
