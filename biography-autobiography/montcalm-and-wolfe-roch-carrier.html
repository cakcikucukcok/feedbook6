      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The national bestseller that tells the story of Wolfe and Montcalm and the Plains of Abraham&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September 1759, a small band of British troops led by James Wolfe scaled the tall cliff overlooking a farmer’s field owned by Abraham Martin and overpowered the French garrison that protected the area, allowing the bulk of the British army to ascend the cliff behind and attack the French who, led by Louis-Joseph Montcalm, were largely unaware of Wolfe’s tactics. The battle that ensued on what would become known as the Plains of Abraham would forever shape the geography and politics of Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Montcalm and Wolfe&lt;/em&gt;, written by one of the finest writers this country has ever produced, is the epic story of this battle told through the lives of the two generals, Wolfe and Montcalm. The book is a dual biography of the men and their most famous battle written by a master storyteller. What kind of life did they have before they took up arms? What were the two men really like?
