His name now almost synonymous with the Cape imprint, Maschler is a renowned and respected publisher; his memoir, illustrated throughout, and reproducing letters from authors as diverse as Roald Dahl and Doris Lessing, offers a rare glimpse into an even rarer world: one of a passionate, driven man, determined to make his mark on that self-same world. From the party where Norman Mailer stabbed his wife, to the porch where Ernest Hemingway shot himself, this is is a frank, first-hand account of the authors, agents and egos, the back-stabbing and dodgy deals, the successes and the enduring friendships formed in the golden days of British publishing." />
