  <title>China High - ZZ</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;A swaggering true tale of sex, drugs and money in the new young professional class in China &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;ZZ&#39;s parents got him out of Communist China--but now that he&#39;s got his American education (including a law degree), under his belt, and now that China loves a go-getting capitalist like ZZ, what better time to return? America was never the &quot;Wild East&quot; like this one: Beijing is the perfect place to start a business, live large, and get a piece of every lissome girl, hash cigarette and bottle of Cristal China has to offer. ZZ taps into China&#39;s unreliable but plentiful workforce of &quot;spit-&#39;n-squatters&quot; to start his brainchild, Goodiez, which delivers food all over Beijing. ZZ is the perfect guide to the real new Beijing: he&#39;s got insider&#39;s cred but an outsider&#39;s eye for the strange mores and daily annoyances of Chinese life. In &lt;I&gt;China High&lt;/I&gt;, he offers a rare glimpse into the world of &lt;I&gt;guan xi &lt;/I&gt;(a network of favors), the insidious importance of &quot;face&quot;, and into the clubs and cafes-- with all their above-ground and below-ground pleasures-- frequented by the new young professional class in China. &lt;br&gt;But ZZ&#39;s glam urban life comes to a crashing halt when he&#39;s picked up by the police for smoking an opium-laced pot &quot;Zigarette.&quot; None of ZZ&#39;s connections do more than get him a few extra dumplings at chow-time in Sunshine Prison, where unable to bribe his way out, he is forced to take a serious look at the life he has been leading.&lt;/p&gt;" />
