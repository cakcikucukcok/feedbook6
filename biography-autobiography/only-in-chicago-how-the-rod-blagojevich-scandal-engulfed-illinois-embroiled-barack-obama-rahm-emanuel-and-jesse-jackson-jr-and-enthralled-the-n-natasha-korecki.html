  <title>Only in Chicago: How the Rod Blagojevich Scandal Engulfed Illinois; Embroiled Barack Obama, Rahm Emanuel, and Jesse Jackson, Jr.; and Enthralled the N - Natasha Korecki</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;&quot;As the circus of the Blagojevich saga unfolded, Natasha Korecki was right at the center.... It was a seriocomedy suited to her enterprise and imagination, and she&amp;#8217;s the one to write the book.&quot; &amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;Roger Ebert&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Natasha Korecki&#39;s chronicle of the Blagojevich saga was a cutting-edge lesson in how to blend old-fashioned reporting with new media.&quot; &amp;#151;&lt;B&gt;Richard Roeper&lt;/B&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Chicago, Illinois, and America at large were captivated by the arrest, trial, and general public embarrassment of Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich. &lt;I&gt;Only in Chicago&lt;/I&gt; is derived from the best of award-winning &lt;I&gt;Chicago Sun-Times&lt;/I&gt; reporter Natasha Korecki&#39;s work on the Blagojevich scandal, weaving together years of reporting and never-before published details into one straightforward, fast-paced narrative. From the infamous audiotapes to Blagojevich&#39;s strange public relations campaign, this is one of the most bizarre true political tales ever told.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Beyond the slew of backroom dealmakers who were sucked into the Blagojevich imbroglio, President Barack Obama himself--while never accused of any wrongdoing--was also interviewed by federal prosecutors. Now-mayor Rahm Emanuel&#39;s discussions with Blagojevich are included as well. The political figure who became most entangled with the scandal, however, was Congressman Jesse Jackson Jr., who is accused of offering Blagojevich $6 million for Obama&#39;s vacated Senate seat through an intermediary.&lt;/div&gt;" />
