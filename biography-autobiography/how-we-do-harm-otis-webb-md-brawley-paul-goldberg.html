  <title>How We Do Harm - Otis Webb Md Brawley, Paul Goldberg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How We Do Harm&lt;/i&gt; exposes the underbelly of healthcare today--the overtreatment of the rich, the under treatment of the poor, the financial conflicts of interest that determine the care that physicians&#39; provide, insurance companies that don&#39;t demand the best (or even the least expensive) care, and pharmaceutical companies concerned with selling drugs, regardless of whether they improve health or do harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Otis Brawley is the chief medical and scientific officer of The American Cancer Society, an oncologist with a dazzling clinical, research, and policy career. &lt;i&gt;How We Do Harm pulls back the curtain &lt;/i&gt;on how medicine is really practiced in America. Brawley tells of doctors who select treatment based on payment they will receive, rather than on demonstrated scientific results; hospitals and pharmaceutical companies that seek out patients to treat even if they are not actually ill (but as long as their insurance will pay); a public primed to swallow the latest pill, no matter the cost; and rising healthcare costs for unnecessary--and often unproven--treatments that we all pay for. Brawley calls for rational healthcare, healthcare drawn from results-based, scientifically justifiable treatments, and not just the peddling of hot new drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brawley&#39;s personal history - from a childhood in the gang-ridden streets of black Detroit, to the green hallways of Grady Memorial Hospital, the largest public hospital in the U.S., to the boardrooms of The American Cancer Society--results in a passionate view of medicine and the politics of illness in America - and a deep understanding of healthcare today. &lt;i&gt;How We Do Harm&lt;/i&gt; is his well-reasoned manifesto for change.&lt;/p&gt;" />
