  <title>Fire in the Hole - Colleen Kelli</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fire in the Hole&lt;/i&gt; is the comically dramatic story of a thirty-something actress facing serious changes in her life while training to become a stuntwoman at a quirky western theme park. Over the course of a year, she divorces her lesbian partner of eight years and loses her sister to suicide. A move from the frenzied urban sprawl of Los Angeles to the tranquil desert of Albuquerque does not improve her spirits, but it does allow her to continue her acting career...at the small-time theme park. Oddly, the misfits she works with at the theme park and even a few of the regular customers become somewhat of a dysfunctional, yet much-needed, family. While learning to fall from a two-story roof and
harmlessly kick a man in the groin, she struggles to survive the rockiest and most emotional year of her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner&lt;/b&gt; - 2010 Reader Views Award, Gay/Lesbian Category&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Winner&lt;/b&gt; - 2011 National Indie Excellence Awards, Gay &amp; Lesbian &amp; Transgender Non-Fiction Category&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finalist&lt;/b&gt; - 2011 Next Generation Indie Book Awards, GLBT (Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual/Transgender) Category&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Wow! Loved this book. Ms. Kelli writes her story in an easily flowing manner and her experiences are at times laugh-out-loud funny. Through her writing I feel like she&#39;s a friend and I wish her all the best in whatever life hands her.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
--Reader Views&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dry wit and quirky style. Told in a slightly self-deprecating tone, the story draws you in from the very first page. It&#39;s a gentle, moving, sometimes uproariously funny read that will have you turning pages in complete enjoyment.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
--Readers Favorite&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is not a conventional gal, her life is not formula and the reader is in for a roaring good read. Her unique style is filled with self awareness, more than a little poignancy and, at times, laugh out loud, hilarious detail.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
--Compulsive Reader&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;I truly enjoyed this hilarious yet edgy book. Colleen&#39;s quick wit is wonderful. This is an enjoyable and insightful read, you never know what to expect next and everything is a surprise.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;
