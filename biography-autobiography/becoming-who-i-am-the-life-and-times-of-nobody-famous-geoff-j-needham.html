  <title>Becoming Who I Am: The Life and Times of Nobody Famous - Geoff J Needham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Geoff Needham was born in Yorkshire, England, in 1947. He never attained fame or fortune - at least not yet - and his life story was destined to fade into unrecorded history. Until he determined that we&#39;re all unique. No matter how humble our origins, no matter how elevated our status we all have a story to tell, we all have experiences to impart and we all have opinions and ideas that should be shared.    This is a deeply personal, reflective, inspiring, thought-provoking and humorous account of his life, his views of the world and the events that made him who he is today. Along the way he tackles many of the world&#39;s major social and economic issues, encompassing a fascinating mosaic of topics including psychology, politics, religion, humanitarianism, science, romance, travel, genetics and music.   Join him on his extensive journey of exploration and self-analysis. And perhaps you&#39;ll learn who you really are..." />
