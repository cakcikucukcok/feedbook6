  <title>Waiting for the Last Bus - Richard Holloway</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Where do we go when we die? Or is there nowhere to go? Is death something we can do or is it just something that happens to us?
Now in his ninth decade, former Bishop of Edinburgh Richard Holloway has spent a lifetime at the bedsides of the dying, guiding countless men and women towards peaceful deaths. In The Last Bus, he presents a positive, meditative and profound exploration of the many important lessons we can learn from death: facing up to the limitations of our bodies as they falter, reflecting on our failings, and forgiving ourselves and others.
But in a modern world increasingly wary of acknowledging mortality, The Last Bus is also a stirring plea to reacquaint ourselves with death. Facing and welcoming death gives us the chance to think about not only the meaning of our own life, but of life itself; and can mean the difference between ordinary sorrow and unbearable regret at the end. 
Radical, joyful and moving, The Last Bus is an invitation to reconsider life&#39;s greatest mystery by one of the most important and beloved religious leaders of our time." />
