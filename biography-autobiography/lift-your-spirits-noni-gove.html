  <title>Lift Your Spirits - Noni Gove</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After eight years of searching for an answer to release nocturnal panic attacks, the author Noni Gove finally found the solution. Here is her story of never giving up hope, keeping an open mind and pressing on with life to the full, regardless of debilitating circumstances. This journey is a year by year account of the numerous modalities and treatments that she reseached and experienced along a very rocky and rough road to recovery. She managed to travel the world and detach from the sensations, which from time to time were so overwhelming. It was an incredible lesson In letting go of the fear factor and trusting that the universe would provide answers, one just had to keep an open mind and not miss an opportunity. How free her life has been since then, how glorious the days and especially the nights, how great it feels to have energy to support others on their journey. No doubt everyone has many aspects of their lives with peaks and troughs, mine has been a journey of extremes in a way, of complete changes in direction, challenges and adventures of the mind, body and spirit." />
