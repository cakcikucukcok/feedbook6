  <title>Between Them - Richard Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From American master Richard Ford, a memoir: his first work of nonfiction, a stirring narrative of memory and parental love&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How is it that we come to consider our parents as people with rich and intense lives that include but also exclude us? Richard Ford&amp;#8217;s parents&amp;#8212;Edna, a feisty, pretty Catholic-school girl with a difficult past; and Parker, a sweet-natured, soft-spoken traveling salesman&amp;#8212;were rural Arkansans born at the turn of the twentieth century. Married in 1928, they lived &amp;#8220;alone together&amp;#8221; on the road, traveling throughout the South. Eventually they had one child, born late, in 1944.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ford, the questions of what his parents dreamed of, how they loved each other and loved him become a striking portrait of American life in the mid-century. &lt;em&gt;Between Them&lt;/em&gt; is his vivid image of where his life began and where his parents&amp;#8217; lives found their greatest satisfaction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bringing his celebrated candor, wit, and intelligence to this most intimate and mysterious of landscapes&amp;#8212;our parents&amp;#8217; lives&amp;#8212;the award-winning storyteller and creator of the iconic Frank Bascombe delivers an unforgettable exploration of memory, intimacy, and love.&lt;/p&gt;" />
