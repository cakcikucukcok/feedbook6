  <title>I Have Come To Set The Earth On Fire: Tragic Events Can Actually Be Blessings - John Michael Chomistek</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;There are rare life events that are so titanic they become a defining moment where life&amp;rsquo;s history becomes understood as those events which happened prior to and those that then happen after that event. For my family, this defining event happened in the early morning hours of July 5, 1996 when we were terrifyingly awakened and cast out of our home by a devastating house fire. Our lives changed that day. The only possessions to our name were those worn on our backs as we escaped the blaze &amp;ndash; then God took over to write a new and glorious story. A story of one of God&amp;rsquo;s plans, carried out through my family, and used by God to energize a community.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The readers of this book will discover that there is always a story within the story. This story is much more than about the things lost, but rather about wonders gained through entry into God&amp;rsquo;s little symphony composed to invigorate our communities through our tragedy. Is it possible that a tragedy can really be a blessing in disguise? This story then tackles the question, &amp;ldquo;Why do bad things happen to good people?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;St. Peter&amp;rsquo;s first Epistle states one must always be prepared to give an explanation to anyone that asks about your reason for hope. This book then provides my explanation for my reason for hope. It also presents a challenge to become an active part of Jesus&amp;rsquo; prayer and plan for salvation.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I bid you now to read the story about the absolutely best thing that ever happened to me that I would never wish on my worst enemy.&lt;/p&gt;" />
