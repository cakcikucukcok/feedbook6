  <title>He Gave Me His Heart, so I Gave Him Mine - Dr. Showkat Alborzi</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Born into Islam, author Showkat Alborzi was an inquisitive young girl who longed to know her creator, her purpose in this world, and the meaning of life. One evening, she looked up to the depth of the sky and called God to reveal the truth of life to her. In her amazement, God showed up! He revealed His love for her in the evening sky by showing her His heart, carved out of clouds. It was the first time Showkat felt Gods presence. God was love. This was beyond Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1979, the Islamic revolution shook Iran and the country plunged into 7th century darkness. She fled to the United States. Years later, God revealed Himself again to her, this time through a poem about the abortion she had years ago. God brought to light her hidden secret and guilt. Although, Jesus was never more than a prophet for her, now she knew He was the true God and that He was ready to forgive her if only she was ready to be forgiven. That was the moment she believed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like a caged bird being freed for the first time, I flapped my wings harder, faster and flew higher to feel, touch, and taste the truth. My Deliverers words were music to my ears:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary. They walk and not be faint. Isaiah 40:31&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the story of Showkats journey from the bondage of religion to the freedom of knowing God, from deception of Islam to the truth of Jesus. It is also an examination of crucial differences between Allah and YHWH, challenging Muslims to examine their beliefs, and offering a glimpse into a religion most Americans know little about, and its profound effect on our world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
