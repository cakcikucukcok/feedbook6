Observe how the victorious Tuskegee Airmen and one of their fighter pilots, Lt. William M. Wheeler proved their superior aerial abilities while faced with discrimination and segregation in the military. Find out about flying the Hump in the &#39;Forgotten Theater&#39; of WWII. Learn what it was like for Marine Sergeant, Leroy Caughey to survive a rocket attack on his barracks in Vietnam. Read the stirring memorial to Captain Benjamin Sklaver, U.S. Army reserve officer killed by a suicide bomber in Afghanistan. These are some of the remarkable stories featured and the history about those who lived it. Interwoven in the essays, are the younger generation&#39;s (the young writers&#39;) introspective reasons why they chose to honor these heroes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
