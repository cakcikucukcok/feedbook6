  <title>First Fruits of Freedom - Janette Thomas Greenwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A moving narrative that offers a rare glimpse into the lives of African American men, women, and children on the cusp of freedom, &lt;i&gt;First Fruits of Freedom&lt;/i&gt; chronicles one of the first collective migrations of blacks from the South to the North during and after the Civil War. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Janette Thomas Greenwood relates the history of a network forged between Worcester County, Massachusetts, and eastern North Carolina as a result of Worcester regiments taking control of northeastern North Carolina during the war. White soldiers from Worcester, a hotbed of abolitionism, protected refugee slaves, set up schools for them, and led them north at war&#39;s end. White patrons and a supportive black community helped many migrants fulfill their aspirations for complete emancipation and facilitated the arrival of additional family members and friends. Migrants established a small black community in Worcester with a distinctive southern flavor.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;But even in the North, white sympathy did not continue after the Civil War. Despite their many efforts, black Worcesterites were generally disappointed in their hopes for full-fledged citizenship, reflecting the larger national trajectory of Reconstruction and its aftermath.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
