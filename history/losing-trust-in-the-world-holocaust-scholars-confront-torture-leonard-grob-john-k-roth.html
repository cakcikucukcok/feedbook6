  <title>Losing Trust in the World: Holocaust Scholars Confront Torture - Leonard Grob, John K. Roth</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;In July 1943, the Gestapo arrested an obscure member of the resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Belgium. When his torture-inflicting interrogators determined he was no use to them and that he was a Jew, he was deported to Auschwitz.

Their inquiry grapples with the euphemistic language often used to disguise torture and with the question of whether torture ever constitutes a &amp;#65533;necessary evil.&amp;#65533; Differences of opinion reverberate, raising deeper questions: Can trust be restored?
