  <title>Always in the Middle of the Battle: Edward Kiniry and the 1St Illinois Light Artillery Battery D - David Edward Wall</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Chapter One: Orphaned and Alone in Manhattan
Edward was an orphan at age ten, and he was now living with relative guardians who treated him with disdain. They certainly did not need another mouth to feed.
Chapter Two: Edward Joined McAllisters Battery and went camping.
The one who attacks now will be victorious, and the enemy will have to be in a hurry if he gets ahead of me. 
Ulysses S. Giant
Chapter Three: Shiloh, Nothing Would Ever Be the Same Again.
On my fall visit to Shiloh in 2006, the leaves were changing their uniforms for those of bright new fall shades, browns, oranges and reds, some so red they were almost purple. This contrasted to the green leaves and blood red earth that appeared on the ground those two deadly days in April, 1862.
Chapter Four: Vicksburg
The President then laid out the concerns and questions he had held about Grants movements and plans for capturing the city and concluded: I now wish to make the Personal acknowledgment that you were right, and I was wrong. A. Lincoln
Chapter Five: Chattanooga
On, On I must go, to meet a soldiers fate ....  William T. Sherman
With the opening of the cracker line, the besieged army was eating better than the investing army.
Chapter Six: Atlanta
At this critical moment a subordinate officer pulled out a pocket handkerchief and tied it to a ramrod, and was in the act of raising it in a token of surrender. Captain Cooper struck it down with his sword, explaining Never! As long as there is a man left.  They had kept track of the guns by the sound, having come to know it as it were, their voices.
Chapter Seven: Railroads, Trains, Indians, Cow Chips, and Chaps
One day as Mr. Murphy &amp; myself was baleing hay we heard someone crossing the Creek, Mike said there were Indians and told me to go to the cabin and get the guns. I started when a big Indian said hold up. I stopped and by then there was another one between me and the cabin so it was all off." />
