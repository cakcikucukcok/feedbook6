  <title>Surviving Biafra - S. Elizabeth Bird, Rosina Umelo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1961, Rosina &#39;Rose&#39; Martin married John Umelo, a young Nigerian she met on a London Tube station platform, eventually moving to Nigeria with him and their children. As Rose taught Classics in Enugu, they found themselves caught up in Nigeria&#39;s Civil War, which followed the 1967 secession of Eastern Nigeria--now named Biafra. The family fled to John&#39;s ancestral village, then moved from place to place as the war closed in. When it ended in 1970, up to 2 million had died, most from starvation. Rose (&#39;worse off than some, better off than many&#39;) had kept notes, capturing the reality of living in Biafra--from excitement in the beginning to despair towards the end.
Immediately after the war, Rose turned her notes into a narrative that described the ingenious ways Biafrans made do, still hoping for victory while their territory shrank and children starved by the thousand. Now anthropologist S. Elizabeth Bird contextualizes Rose&#39;s story, providing background on the progress of the war and international reaction to it. Edited and annotated, Rose&#39;s vivid account of life as a Biafran &#39;Nigerwife&#39; offers a fresh, new look at hope and survival through a brutal war." />
