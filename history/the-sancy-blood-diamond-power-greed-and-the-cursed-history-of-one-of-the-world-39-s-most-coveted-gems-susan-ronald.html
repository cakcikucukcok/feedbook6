  <title>The Sancy Blood Diamond: Power, Greed, and the Cursed History of One of the World&#39;s Most Coveted Gems - Susan Ronald</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The fascinating six-hundred-year history of one of the world&#39;s most coveted gems and the royal feuds, intrigues, and betrayals it engendered&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Sancy Diamond first came to Europe from India in the fourteenth century, and until 1661 it was the largest white diamond-and the most concentrated and secure form of wealth-in all of Christendom. Alternately believed to impart invincibility to its wearer and to bring ruin to any who owned it, the Sancy cast a seemingly mystical spell over everyone from the king of Portugal to Henry III of France to England&#39;s Elizabeth I to Napoleon Bonaparte and Queen Maria Luisa of Spain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The riveting account of one of the most hotly pursued gems in history, The Sancy Blood Diamond follows its six-century journey from the diamond mines of Golconda to where it now modestly resides at the Louvre, among the remnants of the French crown jewels. In a colorful, fast-paced narrative, historian Susan Ronald describes the often violent passions the Sancy engendered among many of the giants of European history. She also describes the pivotal roles it played on the chessboard of European geopolitics, and how it was used to raise armies, settle national debts, and enhance its owners&#39; power and prestige.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Working from primary sources, Ronald solves, once and for all, the mystery of the Sancy&#39;s disappearances in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and she explores the legend of the Sancy curse, which arose after the violent deaths of Burgundy&#39;s Charles the Bold, England&#39;s Charles I, France&#39;s Louis XVI, and other ill-fated owners." />
