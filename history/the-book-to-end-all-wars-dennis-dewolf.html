  <title>THE BOOK TO END ALL WARS - Dennis Dewolf</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;THE BOOK TO END ALL WARS, which is a prelude to a second book, THE PHILOSOPHY OF SELF DESTRUCTION, examins war from the perspective of a metaphorical virus contracted around the time the hunter/gatherer period of mankind&amp;#39;s existence was evolving into more stable lifestyles. Prior to that we see no evidence of war.&amp;nbsp;It then proceeds through subjective, prima facia evidence that the virus is a&amp;nbsp;contracted entity, but not a normal part of human existence. The virus is then tracked through history as we watch it evolve coexistent to human psychological evolution and social structure. We see how a symbiotic relationship evolves that leads us to a dilemma, quite simular to cancer, that questions how&amp;nbsp;to kill the disease without killing the patient. Through both books we look at all aspects of the virus, from its birth and establishment to the vectors it uses for its survival in the BOOK TO END ALL WARS, to a more nuanced appraisal in the second book, THE PHILOSOPHY OF SELF DESTRUCTION. The first book tracks its historical progress noting some early indications that mankind is not only becoming aware of the implications of its own survival versus the virus, but that we have tried to stop its growth through various means andf devices that work as, anti-bodies, so to speak.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;" />
