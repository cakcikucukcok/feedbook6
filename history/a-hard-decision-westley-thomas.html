  <title>A Hard Decision - Westley Thomas</title>
      <meta name="description" content="William and Zera were childhood sweethearts who got married after high school. Thats where the joy in their lives ended! William was off to fight in Vietnam, in service to his country that asked thousands of young men to give up their lifestyles to become soldiers. Like so many other families, William and Zeras lives were uprooted and changed forever. Torn apart by the war, they tried to hold on as best they could. When news came to Zera of Williams death, nothing could repair the pain she felt.
Time seems to heal all wounds and soon Zera met Steve. Although she felt uneasy about it, Zera began dating Steve and they were married. Many years passed before Zera got the shock of her life. One day, there was a phone call, then a visit. When Zera opened her door, of course who should be standing there but William! Zera couldnt believe it. Neither could Zeras current husband, Steve, who actually served with William in the war. Zera was forced to make a hard decision, who to continue her life with? Could you make such a choice? So, who does Zera choose? And what shocking conclusion does the author keep hidden until the very end?
The book is a tribute to the spirit and strength of every human being and what makes people do the things they do. There is something with which every reader will be able to identify. The book combines love, war, loss, family, friendship, death and all of the elements of daily life that anyone could humanly experience." />
