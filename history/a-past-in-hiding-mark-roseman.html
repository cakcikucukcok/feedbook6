  <title>A Past in Hiding - Mark Roseman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;A heart-stopping survivor story and brilliant historical investigation that offers unprecedented insight into daily life in the Third Reich and the Holocaust and the powers and pitfalls of memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the outbreak of World War II, Marianne Strauss, the sheltered daughter of well-to-do German Jews, was an ordinary girl, concerned with studies, friends, and romance. Almost overnight she was transformed into a woman of spirit and defiance, a fighter who, when the Gestapo came for her family, seized the moment and went underground. On the run for two years, Marianne traveled across Nazi Germany without papers, aided by a remarkable resistance organization, previously unknown and unsung. Drawing on an astonishing cache of documents as well as interviews on three continents, historian Mark Roseman reconstructs Marianne&#39;s odyssey and reveals aspects of life in the Third Reich long hidden from view. As Roseman excavates the past, he also puts forward a new and sympathetic interpretation of the troubling discrepancies between fact and recollection that so often cloud survivors&#39; accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A detective story, a love story, a story of great courage and survival under the harshest conditions, &lt;i&gt;A Past in Hiding&lt;/i&gt; is also a poignant investigation into the nature of memory, authenticity, and truth.&lt;/p&gt;" />
