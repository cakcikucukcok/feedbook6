  <title>Redemption - Nicholas Lemann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A century after Appomattox, the civil rights movement won full citizenship for black Americans in the South. It should not have been necessary: by 1870 those rights were set in the Constitution. This is the story of the terrorist campaign that took them away.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;Nicholas Lemann opens his extraordinary new book with a riveting account of the horrific events of Easter 1873 in Colfax, Louisiana, where a white militia of Confederate veterans-turned-vigilantes attacked the black community there and massacred hundreds of people in a gruesome killing spree. This was the start of an insurgency that changed the course of American history: for the next few years white Southern Democrats waged a campaign of political terrorism aiming to overturn the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments and challenge President Grant&#39;ssupport for the emergent structures of black political power. The remorseless strategy of well-financed &quot;White Line&quot; organizations was to create chaos and keep blacks from voting out of fear for their lives and livelihoods. &lt;i&gt;Redemption&lt;/i&gt; is the first book to describe in uncompromising detail this organized racial violence, which reached its apogee in Mississippi in 1875. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lemann bases his devastating account on a wealth of military records, congressional investigations, memoirs, press reports, and the invaluable papers of Adelbert Ames, the war hero from Maine who was Mississippi&#39;s governor at the time. When Ames pleaded with Grant for federal troops who could thwart the white terrorists violently disrupting Republican political activities, Grant wavered, and the result was a bloody, corrupt election in which Mississippi was &lt;br&gt;&quot;redeemed&quot;--that is, returned to white control.&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;Redemption &lt;/i&gt;makes clear that this is what led to the death of Reconstruction--and of the rights encoded in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. We are still living with the consequences.&lt;/p&gt;" />
