  <title>Casting with a Fragile Thread - Wendy Kann</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;In this poignant, lyric memoir, a sister&#39;s tragic death prompts a woman&#39;s unbidden journey into her turbulent African past.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A comfortable suburban housewife with three children living in Connecticut, Wendy Kann thought she had put her volatile childhood in colonial Rhodesia--now Zimbabwe--behind her. Then one Sunday morning came a terrible phone call: her youngest sister, Lauren, had been killed on a lonely road in Zambia. Suddenly unable to ignore her longing for her homeland, she decides she must confront the ghosts of her past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wendy Kann&#39;s is a personal journey, set against a backdrop as exotic as it is desolate. From a privileged colonial childhood of mansions and servants, her story moves to a young adulthood marked by her father&#39;s death, her mother&#39;s insanity, and the viciousness of a bloody civil war. Through unlikely love she finds herself in the incongruous sophistication of Manhattan; three children bring the security of suburban America, until the heartbreaking vulnerability of the small child her sister left behind in Africa compels her to return to a continent she hardly recognizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With honesty and compassion, Kann pieces together her sister&#39;s life, explores the heartbreak of loss and belonging, and finally discovers the true meaning of home.&lt;/p&gt;" />
