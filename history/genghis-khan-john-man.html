  <title>Genghis Khan - John Man</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Genghis Khan is one of history&#39;s immortals, alive in memory as a scourge, hero, military genius and demi-god. To Muslims, Russians and westerners, he is a murderer of millions, a brutal oppressor. Yet in his homeland of Mongolia he is the revered father of the nation, and the Chinese honor him as the founder of a dynasty. In his so-called Mausoleum in Inner Mongolia, worshippers seek the blessing of his spirit. In a supreme paradox, the world&#39;s most ruthless conqueror has become a force for peace and reconciliation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a teenager, Genghis was a fugitive, hiding from enemies on a remote mountainside. Yet he went on to found the world&#39;s greatest land empire and change the course of world history. Brilliant and original as well as ruthless, he ruled an empire twice the size of Rome&#39;s until his death in 1227 placed all at risk. To secure his conquests and then extend them, his heirs kept his death a secret, and secrecy has surrounded him ever since. His undiscovered grave, with its imagined treasures, remains the subject of intrigue and speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is more than just a gripping account of Genghis&#39; rise and conquests. John Man uses first-hand experiences in China and Mongolia to reveal the khan&#39;s enduring influence. He has traveled the length of the empire. He spotlights the tension between Mongols and Chinese, who both claim Genghis&#39; spirit. He is the first writer to explore the hidden valley where Genghis is believed to have died, and one of the few westerners to climb the mountain where he was likely buried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This stunning narrative paints a vivid picture of the man himself, the places where he lived and fought, and the passions that surround him still. For in legend, ritual and intense controversy, Genghis lives on.&lt;/p&gt;" />
