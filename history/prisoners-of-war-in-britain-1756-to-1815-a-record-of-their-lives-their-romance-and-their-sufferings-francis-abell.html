  <title>Prisoners of war in Britain 1756 to 1815; a record of their lives, their romance and their sufferings - Francis, Abell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Preface&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Two influences have urged me to make a study of the subject of the prisoners of war in Britain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
First: the hope that I might be able to vindicate our country against the charge so insistently brought against her that she treated the prisoners of war in her custody with exceptional inhumanity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Second: a desire to rescue from oblivion a not unimportant and a most interesting chapter of our national history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Whether my researches show the foregoing charge to be proven or not proven remains for my readers to judge. I can only say that I have striven to the utmost to prevent the entrance of any national bias into the presentation of the picture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As to the second influence. It is difficult to account for the fact that so interesting a page of our history should have remained unwritten. Even authors of fiction, who have pressed every department of history into their service, have, with about half a dozen exceptions, neglected it as a source of inspiration, whilst historical accounts are limited to Mr. Basil Thomson&amp;rsquo;s Story of Dartmoor Prison, Dr. T. J. Walker&amp;rsquo;s Norman Cross, and Mr. W. Sievwright&amp;rsquo;s Perth Dep&amp;ocirc;t, all of which I have been permitted to make use of, and local handbooks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yet the sojourn among us of thousands of war prisoners between the years 1756 and 1815 must have been an important feature of our national life&amp;mdash;especially that of officers on parole in our country towns; despite which, during my quest in many counties of England, Scotland, and Wales, I have been surprised to find how rapidly and completely the memory of this sojourn has faded; how faintly even it lingers in local tradition; how much haziness there is, even in the minds of educated people, as to who or what prisoners of war were; and how the process of gathering information has been one of almost literal excavation and disinterment. But the task has been a great delight. It has introduced me to all sorts and conditions of interesting people; it has taken me to all sorts of odd nooks and corners of the country; and it has drawn my attention to a literature which is not less valuable because it is merely local. I need not say that but for the interest and enthusiasm of private individuals I could never have accomplished the task, and to them I hope I have made sufficient acknowledgement in the proper places, although it is possible that, from their very multitude, I may have been guilty of omissions, for which I can only apologize.&lt;br /&gt;
