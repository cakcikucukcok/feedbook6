  <title>Reclaiming Israel&#39;s History - David Brog</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The Real History of Israel and the Palestinians&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
No history is so disputed as the history of Israel. Some see Israel&#39;s creation as a dramatic act of justice for the Jewish people. Others insist that it was a crime against Palestine&#39;s Arabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Author David Brog untangles the facts from the myths to reveal the truth about the Arab-Israeli conflict. In &lt;em&gt;Reclaiming Israel&#39;s History&lt;/em&gt; you&#39;ll learn how the Jewish people have maintained a continual presence in the Land of Israel for over 3,000 years&amp;mdash;despite centuries of Roman, Byzantine, and Muslim persecution; how the Romans invented the word &quot;Palestine&quot; as a way to sever the connection between the Jewish people and their land (and how subsequent conquerors doubled down on this strategy); how modern Jewish immigration to Palestine did not displace Arabs but instead sparked an Arab population boom; and the largely untold story of how the leader of Palestine&#39;s Arabs collaborated with the Nazis to murder Jews in Europe before they could reach their ancestral homeland. You&#39;ll also learn why most of Palestine&#39;s Arabs never identified themselves as &quot;Palestinians&quot; until after the 1967 War; the extraordinary lengths to which Israel&#39;s military goes to protect Palestinian civilians (and the high price Israel&#39;s soldiers pay for this morality), and how the Palestinians have on  separate occasions rejected Israel&#39;s offers of a Palestinian state in virtually all of the West Bank and Gaza.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Brog frankly admits to Israel&#39;s &quot;sins both large and small,&quot; but notes that in any fair-minded analysis these have been far out- weighed by Israel&#39;s commitment to Western values, including freedom, democracy, and human rights. Honest, provocative, and timely, especially given rising anti-Semitism and the aggressive delegitimization of Israel, David Brog&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Reclaiming Israel&#39;s History&lt;/em&gt; is the book for every reader who wants to understand what is really happening in the Middle East." />
