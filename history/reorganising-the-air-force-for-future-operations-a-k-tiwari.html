  <title>Reorganising the Air Force for Future Operations - A K Tiwari</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is an era of exponential growth especially in technologies. Air Forces are the most technology intensive fighting arms. An ideal Air Force would constantly embrace and adopt new technologies to retain it&#39;s cutting edge and all dominant status in battle space. Failure to do so may spell it&#39;s doom when faced with more current Air Force. Along with new technology there is  a need to reorganise many aspects in the organisation. These include, but are not limited to, command and control setup, inter-service integration, HR function, organisational culture and attitude etc etc. This study focuses on the reorganisation already due and suggests  ideas for the future.  About the Author Air Vice Marshal AK Tiwary, VSM was commissioned in the Indian Air Force as a fighter pilot. He served as a ground based Forward Air Controller during the 1971 Indo-Pak conflict.  His flying hours, over 4100, are mostly on Russian fighters and include about 2000 hours of instructional flying.  He has commanded a MiG-29 Squadron in late 80s.  His various command and staff appointments like Chief Operations Officer at a major Wing, operational planning at Command level, Director Concept Studies at Air HQ, Command of a major flying base, Head of the Training Team (Air) at Defence Service Staff College and Senior Directing Staff (Air) at National Defence College have conferred a rich practical experience.  The air staff course at DSSC Wellington (TN), instructional tenure at the College of Air Warfare Secunderabad, National Defence College New Delhi, Command and Air War Course at the Air University, Maxwell Airbase, Montgomery (USA), all inducted and accelerated his interest in air war studies.  He has published many articles in professional military journals in India and authored five books titled, &quot;Attrition in Air Warfare&quot; ,  &quot;Air Power and Counter Insurgency&quot;, &quot;Aerospace Defence&quot;, &quot;Glimpses of Western Air Command History&quot; and  &quot;Operational History of IAF&quot; After pre-mature retirement He now flies as Commander on Boeing 737-800 NG." />
