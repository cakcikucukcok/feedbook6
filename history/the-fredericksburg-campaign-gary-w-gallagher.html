  <title>The Fredericksburg Campaign - Gary W. Gallagher</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It is well this is so terrible! We should grow too fond of it,&quot; said General Robert E. Lee as he watched his troops repulse the Union attack at Fredericksburg on 13 December 1863.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This collection of seven original essays by leading Civil War historians reinterprets the bloody Fredericksburg campaign and places it within a broader social and political context. By analyzing the battle&#39;s antecedents as well as its aftermath, the contributors challenge some long-held assumptions about the engagement and clarify our picture of the war as a whole.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The book begins with revisionist assessments of the leadership of Ambrose Burnside and Robert E. Lee and a portrait of the conduct and attitudes of one group of northern troops who participated in the failed assaults at Marye&#39;s Heights. Subsequent essays examine how both armies reacted to the battle and how the northern and southern homefronts responded to news of the carnage at Frederickburg. A final chapter explores the impact of the battle on the residents of the Fredericksburg area and assesses changing Union attitudes about the treatment of Confederate civilians.      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The contributors are William Marvel, Alan T. Nolan, Carol Reardon, Gary W. Gallagher, A. Wilson Greene, George C. Rable, and William A. Blair.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;!--copy for pb cover:&lt;br/&gt;This collection of seven original essays by leading Civil War historians reinterprets the bloody Fredericksburg campaign and places it within a broader social and political context.
