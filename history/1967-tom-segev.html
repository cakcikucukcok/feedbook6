  <title>1967 - Tom Segev</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From Israel&#39;s leading historian, a sweeping history of 1967--the war, what led up to it, what came after, and how it changed everything&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Segev&#39;s acclaimed works One Palestine, Complete and The Seventh Million overturned accepted views of the history of Israel. Now, in &lt;i&gt;1967&lt;/i&gt;--a number-one bestseller in Hebrew--he brings his masterful skills to the watershed year when six days of war reshaped the country and the entire region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Going far beyond a military account, Segev re-creates the crisis in Israel before 1967, showing how economic recession, a full grasp of the Holocaust&#39;s horrors, and the dire threats made by neighbor states combined to produce a climate of apocalypse. He depicts the country&#39;s bravado after its victory, the mood revealed in a popular joke in which one soldier says to his friend, &quot;Let&#39;s take over Cairo&quot;; the friend replies, &quot;Then what shall we do in the afternoon?&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Drawing on unpublished letters and diaries, as well as government memos and military records, Segev reconstructs an era of new possibilities and tragic missteps. He introduces the legendary figures--Moshe Dayan, Golda Meir, Gamal Abdul Nasser, and Lyndon Johnson--and an epic cast of soldiers, lobbyists, refugees, and settlers. He reveals as never before Israel&#39;s intimacy with the White House as well as the political rivalries that sabotaged any chance of peace. Above all, he challenges the view that the war was inevitable, showing that a series of disastrous miscalculations lie behind the bloodshed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vibrant and original history, &lt;i&gt;1967&lt;/i&gt; is sure to stand as the definitive account of that pivotal year.&lt;/p&gt;" />
