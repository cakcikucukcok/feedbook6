  <title>The Greatest Horse of All - Charles Justice</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Using the most basic statistics, completely explained, the author selects the sixteen most likely candidates for the title: &quot;greatest horse of the twentieth century.&quot;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Fifty colts and fillies, listed mainly ina 1999 publication by The Blood-Horse, Inc., were compared using a three-part process. This process narrowed the top contenders to sixteen.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The past performance data for these Thoroughbreds were obtained from the Daily Racing Form&#39;s 2000 publication &lt;EM&gt;Champions.&lt;/EM&gt; &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Using results identical to those explained in the book, the author calculates that the best likely average time for Big Brown to run the upcoming Belmont is 147.54 seconds, or 2:27.54. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One hundred simulations at 12 furlongs, based on Big Brown&#39;s current 2008 performance data and the past 36 years of Belmont winning times, indicate he has a 72-percent chance of winning the triple crown.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The identical formulas used in the book on the past performance data for Secretariat, Seattle Slew and Affirmed, came within fractional seconds of predicting their Belmont/Triple Crown wins.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Of course, as most Wall Street pundits will warn, past performance is not a guarantee of future performance!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;And now, in retrospect, Big Brown sadly did not win. Had he run as he was capable, the predicted time stated above would have beaten the winner, Da&#39;Tara, by 2.09 seconds!&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Charles Justice&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;June 5 and 9, 2008&lt;/P&gt;
