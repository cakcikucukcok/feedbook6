  <title>On Strike and on Film - Ellen R. Baker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In 1950, Mexican American miners went on strike for fair working conditions in Hanover, New Mexico. When an injunction prohibited miners from picketing, their wives took over the picket lines--an unprecedented act that disrupted mining families but ultimately ensured the strikers&#39; victory in 1952. In &lt;i&gt;On Strike and on Film&lt;/i&gt;, Ellen Baker examines the building of a leftist union that linked class justice to ethnic equality. She shows how women&#39;s participation in union activities paved the way for their taking over the picket lines and thereby forcing their husbands, and the union, to face troubling questions about gender equality.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Baker also explores the collaboration between mining families and blacklisted Hollywood filmmakers that resulted in the controversial 1954 film &lt;i&gt;Salt of the Earth&lt;/i&gt;. She shows how this worker-artist alliance gave the mining families a unique chance to clarify the meanings of the strike in their own lives and allowed the filmmakers to create a progressive alternative to Hollywood productions. An inspiring story of working-class solidarity, Mexican American dignity, and women&#39;s liberation, &lt;i&gt;Salt of the Earth&lt;/i&gt; was itself blacklisted by powerful anticommunists, yet the movie has endured as a vital contribution to American cinema.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
