Woah&amp;hellip; what does he/she look like?&lt;br /&gt;
Very often, we are so caught up in our present world that we fail to look into our past and ahead into our future.&lt;br /&gt;
Homo Deus recounts the course of history and deals with the abilities acquired by humans (Homo Sapiens) throughout their existence, and their evolution as the dominant species in the world.&lt;br /&gt;
The book discusses many philosophical issues such as the human experience, individualism, human emotion and consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Homo Deus &lt;/b&gt;by Yuval Noah Harari is first published in 2015. Since then, it has been in the bestselling list in the top retailers. Time Magazine listed Homo Deus as one of its top ten non-fiction books of 2017.&lt;br /&gt;
