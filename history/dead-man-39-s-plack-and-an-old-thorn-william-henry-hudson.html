  <title>Dead Man&#39;s Plack and An Old Thorn - William Henry Hudson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Dead Man&#39;s Plack and An Old Thorn&quot; was written by Argentinian naturalist W. H. Hudson and first published in 1920. It contains two essays by Hudson, both of which are written in beautiful prose and concern a different location in the English countryside. This volume is highly recommended for lovers of nature writing, and it is not to be missed by fans and collectors of Hudson&#39;s seminal work. William Henry Hudson (1841 - 1922) was an Argentinian naturalist, author, and ornithologist. He was one of the founding members of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, and is best known for his novel &quot;Green Mansions&quot; (1904). Other notable works include &quot;A Crystal Age&quot; (1887) and &quot;Far Away and Long Ago&quot; (1918), which has since been adapted into a film. Many vintage books such as this are becoming increasingly scarce and expensive. We are republishing this volume now in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author." />
