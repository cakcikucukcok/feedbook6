  <title>The Shining Path - Gustavo Gorriti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="First published in Peru in 1990, &lt;i&gt;The Shining Path&lt;/i&gt; was immediately hailed as one of the finest works on the insurgency that plagued that nation for over fifteen years. A richly detailed and absorbing account, it covers the dramatic years between the guerrillas&#39; opening attack in 1980 and President Fernando Belaunde&#39;s reluctant decision to send in the military to contain the growing rebellion in late 1982. Covering the strategy, actions, successes, and setbacks of both the government and the rebels, the book shows how the tightly organized insurgency forced itself upon an unwilling society just after the transition from an authoritarian to a democratic regime.&lt;br/&gt;One of Peru&#39;s most distinguished journalists, Gustavo Gorriti first covered the Shining Path movement for the leading Peruvian newsweekly, &lt;i&gt;Caretas&lt;/i&gt;. Drawing on hundreds of interviews and an impressive array of government and Shining Path documents, he weaves his careful research into a vivid portrait of the now-jailed Shining Path leader Abimael Guzman, Belaunde and his generals, and the unfolding drama of the fiercest war fought on Peruvian soil since the Chilean invasion a century before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;" />
