  <title>Insights into Modern World History - James Litai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Insights into Modern World History is a material that uses interpretative approach to examine political, social, and economic changes of the twentieth- to twenty-first-century world. A substantially updated approach to 2015 exactly in line with Upper Secondary School Certificate Examination (USSCE) requirements. 
This book is perfected purposely for Papua New Guinea schools. A convenient text material for both teachers and students to have access and gain the insights of modern world history. 
The National Department of Educations motto is Prosperity through self reliance; thus this project is one out of many the department is yet to accomplish.
Plenty of maps and cartoons are included in each unit. All units are summarized by external exam-type review questions. 
The trends in Papua New Guinea history beginning 1526 from the first explorer who sited our island to 1884, formal proclamation by Germany and Britain to 1951, the first twenty-nine-member legislative council. The chronology counts on to 1964, first elections to 1973, self-government to 1975, our independence. As I write, the country is turning forty years now.
This text material is the 2015 latest version. There are four important chapters included and the chapters are (1) Writing a good Essay, (2) The Chronicles: Key Events of the World, (3) The Chronicles: Key Events of Papua New Guinea, and (4) The Glossary. These chapters gives detailed information chronologically." />
