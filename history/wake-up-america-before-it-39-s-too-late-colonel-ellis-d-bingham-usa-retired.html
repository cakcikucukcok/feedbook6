  <title>Wake up America Before It&#39;s Too Late! - Colonel Ellis D. Bingham Usa, Retired</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Deep within our own Unites States Government and elements within and outside our nation, there appears to be an insidious plot to destroy our Christian heritage and our American way of life.  This will never happen as long as our citizens are armed as provided for in our Constitution.  Unfortunately, most citizens are immersed in their day-to-day activities to provide for their families and do not have the time to sift through and analyze the wealth of information provided by modern technology.  Those that have the time to monitor the internet and other media are flooded with information, much of which is disinformation.  This causes uncertainty, fear, worry and stress on our citizens.  This Decision Paper puts together seven situations that, if not acted upon and corrected, will destroy this great nation.  All nations should realize that if America, as the world knows it is destroyed, the free world will cease to exist." />
