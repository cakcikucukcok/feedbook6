  <title>Haym by George - Jackson Grin, Spencer Grin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Many people know George is George Washington, the father of our country. Many, however, do not know the details of his brilliant career as a soldier, his stand on slavery, and his fervor in establishing the freedoms we hold dear. Nor do they know that despite his superb leadership we would have lost the revolutionary war and our chance to become an independent nation if it were not for foreign intervention.
Few know Haym Salomon, the savior of our country. Who was he, and why was he important? 
He was a Jewish Polish immigrant who was mainly responsible for financing the American Revolutionary War. He was caught by the British and sentenced to death as an American spy. How he escaped the hangmans noose and became a friend of George Washington is part of the story. 
George Washington said, Haym Salomon provided the funds for our army when everyone, including all the colonies, refused. If it were not for Haym Salomon, we could not have fought the Revolutionary War and won our independence, nor survived as a newborn nation. 
The lives and times of George Washington and Haym Salomon are inextricably woven into the fabric of the Revolutionary War, our fight for independence, and the ideals upon which this nation was founded. This book, therefore, encompasses much of the magnificent contributions of these two patriots and the actual events that led to the difficult birth, and early survival, of the United States of America and the principles forever enshrined to protect our democracy." />
