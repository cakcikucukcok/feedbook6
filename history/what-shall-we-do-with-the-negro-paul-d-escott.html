  <title>&quot;What Shall We Do with the Negro?&quot; - Paul D. Escott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Throughout the Civil War, newspaper headlines and stories repeatedly asked some
    variation of the question posed by the New York Times in 1862, &quot;What shall we do with the
    negro?&quot; The future status of African Americans was a pressing issue for those in both the
    North and in the South. Consulting a broad range of contemporary newspapers, magazines, books,
    army records, government documents, publications of citizens’ organizations, letters,
    diaries, and other sources, Paul D. Escott examines the attitudes and actions of Northerners and
    Southerners regarding the future of African Americans after the end of slavery. &quot;What Shall
    We Do with the Negro?&quot; demonstrates how historians together with our larger national
    popular culture have wrenched the history of this period from its context in order to portray
    key figures as heroes or exemplars of national virtue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Escott gives especial
    critical attention to Abraham Lincoln. Since the civil rights movement, many popular books have
    treated Lincoln as an icon, a mythical leader with thoroughly modern views on all aspects of
    race. But, focusing on Lincoln’s policies rather than attempting to divine Lincoln’s
    intentions from his often ambiguous or cryptic statements, Escott reveals a president who placed
    a higher priority on reunion than on emancipation, who showed an enduring respect for
    states’ rights, who assumed that the social status of African Americans would change very
    slowly in freedom, and who offered major incentives to white Southerners at the expense of the
    interests of blacks.Escott’s approach reveals the depth of slavery’s influence on
    society and the pervasiveness of assumptions of white supremacy. &quot;What Shall We Do with the
    Negro?&quot; serves as a corrective in offering a more realistic, more nuanced, and less
    celebratory approach to understanding this crucial period in American history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
