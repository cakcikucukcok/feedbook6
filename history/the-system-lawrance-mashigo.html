  <title>The System - Lawrance Mashigo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book reflects the real truth about South Africa today, what people cant tell others and what cant be said. Today SA is perceived and presented as a holy country that came from evil, which is not true since most people are suffering while leadership fails them. br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This is a book that refers to certain events and issues and compare, relate with honesty the position of the author around such events and issues. It talks of how the author sees the system, areas of governance and how it is done and he goes deep inside of identifying some of those who are at the top and their questionable acts. Government departments fail and are protected to undermine ordinary people intelligence. br&gt;
br&gt;
This book raises certain issues by taking your mind into an ordinary South African who lives where he is directly affected by the failures of governance because of corruption and power struggle by leadership. The author goes to the level of going into how certain leaders failed the public on executing their duties. br&gt;
br&gt;
This is not the book that will interest those who follow politics only; it goes further by introducing different topics and how they are mishandled by leaders. For a moment it goes into the ANC leadership and ANC as a political party to see and analyze real issues within. The author presents the view of controversial Julius Malema, and surprisingly presents the side that the media never presented. br&gt;
br&gt;
The book refers to various topics like politics, the media, traditional communities-laws and practice, the gap between the rich and the poor, xenophobia and many more. The most amazing and interesting angle of traditional communities presented through what is happening in the Bakwena Ba Mogopa Traditional Community who are rich in natural resources. br&gt;
br&gt;
He observed the most and critical systems that are not benefiting the people, and raising them as a black man with real references since his observation registered whites critics only, and differently present other issues around Land Restitution Corruption/Failures and Government strategy of undermining the rural leadership/communities etc. br&gt;
br&gt;
SA has been presented as a media free society, where media has freedom to report on different issues and no other platform seems to be there to criticize the media unless if the media itself open a limited debate along its criticism, this book criticizes the media. br&gt;
br&gt;
Touching on Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) and its effect, this time it brings a different angle! Be presented with different laws and simple interpretations and how leadership is failing to observe them. br&gt;
br&gt;
This is a book that everybody needs to have because it is simple and was written to present complex issues differently. You will see as you go by it that ordinary South Africans are being disrespected by leaders and all is not good in SA. br&gt;
br&gt;
The author has presented views and questions that needs to identify real challenges that SA faces. Why people are so afraid of criticizing the ANC, the media, government and many powerful factors that lead us? This is a book that will bring a good debate to fix some of the problems in SA." />
