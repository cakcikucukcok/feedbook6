  <title>The Avengement - V. A. Herbert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="One man, Abraham Lincoln, was the sole cause of the War Between the States, l861  1865, and the deaths of almost one million Americans.   Honest,  compassionate and kind hearted, but forthright to an extreme, Lincoln spoke for millions of Americans who detested slavery, and wanted to eradicate it, and for millions more who wanted to preserve the Union  upon  confronting the secession of eleven southern states
    By calling for  75,000 volunteers, men to defend the Union immediately following the attack in Charleston Harbor, Lincoln knowingly inflamed the situation.  The war was on.  Lincoln wanted it.  He also knew that it could have been avoided, it could have been settled amicably without the loss of any men from the North or the South.  Lincoln knew that the U.S. Constitution was silent on the issue of secession, that there was then, as there is now, absolutely nothing in the Constitution that prevents any state or any number of states, from peacefully leaving the Union.
