  <title>Supreme Commander - Seymour Morris, Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Seymour Morris Jr. combines political history, military biography, and business management to tell the story of General Douglas MacArthur&amp;#39;s tremendous success in rebuilding Japan after World War II in &lt;em&gt;Supreme Commander&lt;/em&gt;, a lively, in-depth work of biographical history complementary to &lt;em&gt;The Generals, The Storm of War&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Truman.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is the most decorated general in American history&amp;#8212;and the only five five-star general to receive the Medal of Honor. Yet Douglas MacArthur&amp;#39;s greatest victory was not in war but in peace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the uniquely titled Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, he was charged with transforming a defeated, militarist empire into a beacon of peace and democracy&amp;#8212;&amp;#8220;the greatest gamble ever attempted,&amp;#8221; he called it. A career military man, MacArthur had no experience in politics, diplomacy, or economics. A vain, reclusive, and self-centered man, his many enemies in Washington thought he was a flaming peacock, and few, including President Harry Truman&amp;#39;s closest advisors, gave him a chance of succeeding. Yet MacArthur did so brilliantly, defying timetables and expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Supreme Commander&lt;/em&gt; tells for the first time, the story of how MacArthur&amp;#39;s leadership achieved a nation-building success that had never been attempted before&amp;#8212;and never replicated since. Seymour Morris Jr. reveals this flawed man at his best who treated a defeated enemy with respect; who made informed and thoughtful decisions yet could be brash and stubborn when necessary, and who lead the Occupation with intelligence, class, and compassion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morris analyzes MacArthur&amp;#39;s key tactical choices, explaining how each contributed to his accomplishment, and paints a detailed picture of a true patriot&amp;#8212;a man of conviction who proved to be an outstanding and effective leader in the most extraordinary circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;" />
