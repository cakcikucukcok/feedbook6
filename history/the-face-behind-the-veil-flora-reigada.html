  <title>The Face Behind the Veil - Flora Reigada</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In ancient Israel, only high priests were allowed through the veil into the &quot;Holy of Holies&quot; of the temple.  Thousands of years later, this legacy continues with a baby girl.  As the Great Depression looms, Naomi is born with the legendary &quot;birth veil&quot; over her face.
