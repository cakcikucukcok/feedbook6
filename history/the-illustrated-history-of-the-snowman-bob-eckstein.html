  <title>The Illustrated History of the Snowman - Bob Eckstein</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;A thoroughly entertaining exploration, this book travels back in time to shed light on the snowman&amp;#39;s enigmatic past -- from the present day, in which the snowman reigns as the King of Kitsch, to the Dark Ages, with the creation of the very first snowman. Eckstein&amp;#39;s curiosity began playfully enough, but soon snowballed into a (mostly) earnest quest of chasing Frosty around the world, into museums and libraries, and seeking out the advice of leading historians and scholars. The result is a riveting history that reaches back through centuries and across cultures -- sweeping from fifteenth-century Italian snowballs to eighteenth-century Russian ice sculptures to the regrettable &amp;quot;white-trash years&amp;quot; (1975-2000). The snowman is not just part of our childhood memories, but is an integral part of our world culture, appearing -- much like a frozen Forrest Gump -- alongside dignitaries and celebrities during momentous events. Again and again, the snowman pops up in rare prints, paintings, early movies, advertising and, over the past century, in every art form imaginable. And the jolly snowman -- ostensibly as pure as the driven snow -- also harbors a dark past full of political intrigue, sex, and violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With over two hundred illustrations, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;The Illustrated History of the Snowman&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; is a truly original winter classic -- smart, surprisingly enlightening, and quite simply the coolest book ever.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
