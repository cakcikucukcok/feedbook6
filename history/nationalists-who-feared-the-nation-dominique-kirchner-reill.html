  <title>Nationalists Who Feared the Nation - Dominique Kirchner Reill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="We can often learn as much from political movements that failed as from those that achieved their goals. &lt;I&gt;Nationalists Who Feared the Nation&lt;/I&gt; looks at one such frustrated movement:  a group of community leaders and writers in Venice, Trieste, and Dalmatia during the 1830s, 40s, and 50s who proposed the creation of a multinational zone surrounding the Adriatic Sea. At the time, the lands of the Adriatic formed a maritime community whose people spoke different languages and practiced different faiths but identified themselves as belonging to a single region of the Hapsburg Empire. While these activists hoped that nationhood could be used to strengthen cultural bonds, they also feared nationalism&#39;s homogenizing effects and its potential for violence. This book demonstrates that not all nationalisms attempted to create homogeneous, single-language, -religion, or -ethnicity nations. Moreover, in treating the Adriatic lands as one unit, this book serves as a correction to &quot;national&quot; histories that impose our modern view of nationhood on what was a multinational region." />
