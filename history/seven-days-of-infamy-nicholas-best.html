  <title>Seven Days of Infamy - Nicholas Best</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;December 7, 1941: One of those rare days in world history that people remember exactly where they were, what they were doing, and how they felt when they heard the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marlene Dietrich, Clark Gable, and James Cagney were in Hollywood. Kurt Vonnegut was in the bath, and Dwight D. Eisenhower was napping. Kirk Douglas was a waiter in New York, getting nowhere with Lauren Bacall. Ed Murrow was preparing for a round of golf in Washington. In &lt;i&gt;Seven Days of Infamy,&lt;/i&gt; historian Nicholas Best uses fascinating individual perspectives to relate the story of Japan&#39;s momentous attack on Pearl Harbor and its global repercussions in tense, dramatic style. But he doesn&#39;t stop there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Best takes readers on an unprecedented journey through the days surrounding the attack, providing a snapshot of figures around the world--from Ernest Hemingway on the road in Texas to Jack Kennedy playing touch football in Washington; Mao Tse-tung training his forces in Yun&#39;an and the Jews in Nazi-occupied Europe cheering as the United States entered the war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Offering a human look at an event that would forever alter the global landscape, &lt;i&gt;Seven Days of Infamy &lt;/i&gt;chronicles one of the most extraordinary weeks in world history.&lt;/p&gt;" />
