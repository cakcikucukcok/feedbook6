~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Good morning,&amp;rdquo; Jason&amp;#39;s father said, walking into the kitchen. Shannon followed him, her golden head at a level with her father&amp;#39;s shoulder. He glanced at her, then back to his toast, and then back at her, doing an absurd double-take.&lt;br /&gt;
Shannon was naked from the waist up. Her thighs and hips were clothed in a brightly colored skirt, but her torso and breasts were exposed for everyone to see.&lt;br /&gt;
He felt the blood drain out of his face, and then return in a blazing flush.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well,&amp;rdquo; his mother said, her voice low, cool, and amused. &amp;ldquo;This is quite a change from what you usually wear to the breakfast table, Shannie.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Her skin blushed a delicate pink, contrasting beautifully with her rich golden hair and dark blue eyes. Jason tried to keep his eyes away from his sister&amp;#39;s chest, but was only marginally successful. &amp;ldquo;I talked with Dad about it last night. Before he went back to your room, Mom.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
She raised her chin, looking at the other members of her family. &amp;ldquo;I worship the Goddess,&amp;rdquo; she said, her voice soft but firm. &amp;ldquo;And she tells us that the human body is beautiful. It is something to be celebrated, not hidden. So, with your permission,&amp;rdquo; she added, looking at her parents, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m going to dress like this at home from now on. Sometimes. When it&amp;#39;s comfortable.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
His mother nodded. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;#39;s fine, honey.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Jason&amp;#39;s mouth fell open. She could not be serious! But she seemed to be. She spread her bagel with cream cheese as his father mixed up a bowl of instant oatmeal and put it in the microwave. He scattered some raisins on top and sat down between his wife and oldest daughter. &amp;ldquo;Where&amp;#39;s Angie?&amp;rdquo; he asked, through his first mouthful.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Still asleep, I think,&amp;rdquo; his wife answered.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, I&amp;#39;m not,&amp;rdquo; the subject of the conversation said, bouncing into the kitchen. &amp;ldquo;Whoa.&amp;rdquo; She stopped, glancing from her older sister to her parents and back again. &amp;ldquo;Did someone steal all your shirts and bras?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Shannon apparently worships the Goddess, and is going to be going around the house topless from now on.&amp;rdquo; Jason tried to keep the acidic bite from his words, but apparently failed, as both Shannon and his mother flashed annoyed glances his way.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Huh. Well, better be careful, Shannie. As big as you are up top, it won&amp;#39;t take much before you&amp;#39;re all floppy and dangly. Guys have problems with that sort of thing.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Shannon giggled, her face turning pink. The motion made her jiggle, and Jason looked away, though he noticed his parents didn&amp;#39;t seem to mind. &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;#39;t think I have to worry about that yet,&amp;rdquo; she said, a naughty gleam in her eye.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Don&amp;#39;t count on it. Remember puberty? One day I was an A-cup and was trolling the internet, looking for breast enhancers. Six months later I had these girls,&amp;rdquo; she said, smirking, reaching up to cup herself. She lifted them proudly. &amp;ldquo;Not quite as big as yours, but they do the job. So watch out. Dad might stop boning you if you look like Elsie the Cow.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hmmm. What do you think, Dad?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m not noticing an urge to run away screaming just yet,&amp;rdquo; his father replied. He reached around, pulling his daughter close, leaning over for a kiss.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Want to go back upstairs?&amp;rdquo; Shannon said softly.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You bet,&amp;rdquo; her father said, pushing away his empty bowl.&lt;br /&gt;
Beverly smiled as the two left the room, hand in hand and talking softly." />
