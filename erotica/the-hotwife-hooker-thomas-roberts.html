  <title>The Hotwife Hooker - Thomas Roberts</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An innocent fantasy becomes so much...more!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jennifer has no idea how her life will change when she discovers some racy hotwife movies and books. Suddenly she&amp;#39;s obsessed with becoming a hotwife! But things get way out of control when her husband uneasily suggests she pretend to be a hooker and he&amp;#39;ll be her eager john. Instead of meeting him as planned, why has she taken off with three huge black men?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#39;d stopped in a bar for a drink after dropping Jennifer off on a street corner and driving around. I&amp;#39;d even watched a few innings of a baseball game on the TV behind the bar, above the liquor bottles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn&amp;#39;t concentrate on anything. All I could think about was Jennifer, dressed like a whore, on the street with a woman named Mercedes. Who definitely was a whore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What had I done? I&amp;#39;d put my wife, the mother of our child, on the street looking like she was a hooker. What was wrong with me? Had I lost my mind?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was in agony. My stomach hurt, my heart was racing, and I felt like throwing up. I started to feel faint and the bartender walked over to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Are you alright, buddy?&amp;quot; he asked. &amp;quot;Do you need anything?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I tried to answer him but found my throat seemed paralyzed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Let me get you a ginger ale,&amp;quot; he offered. &amp;quot;Do you need me to call anybody?&amp;quot; I gulped the soft drink and shook my head no.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m just upset,&amp;quot; I finally got out. &amp;quot;I think I did something really stupid. My wife and I are playing a little game and she&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Under the Bridge&amp;quot; with a hooker.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Buddy,&amp;quot; he stood back and stared at me. &amp;quot;You better go get her. She&amp;#39;s not safe, especially if she&amp;#39;s with one of the girls. A lot of them come in here, and I even like a few, but I wouldn&amp;#39;t trust them with anything important. Especially not my wife.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was frozen with fear, it was as though everything stood still for a moment. I was staring at the bartender, who wasn&amp;#39;t moving. The people around me had frozen in place, their drinks halfway to their mouths, some people in midstride. Nothing moved.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly, the world became animated again. Everybody was moving again, but they were moving at twice the speed they&amp;#39;d been moving before. Voices sounded like cartoon characters. The bartender moved away from me at speed, talked to a cocktail waitress for what seemed like a second, and mixed two drinks before the clock could tick again.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I figured I owed a little more than five dollars, but I left a twenty wedged under my glass, and bolted for the door. I pushed past people, men yelled at me and a woman squealed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Out on the street I rushed toward &amp;quot;Under the Bridge&amp;quot; before remembering the car and turned around, catching the people behind me off guard. Again, men and women yelled, but I was running toward the parking lot and nobody cared to give chase. Seeing and hearing the commotion, people scattered in front of me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The lot was in sight when I fell to my knees and slid before hitting my head on the pavement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Are you all right?&amp;quot; a woman asked. I barely glanced at her before I was up and running again. I used my handkerchief to wipe blood from my forehead, there seemed to be a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn&amp;#39;t find the car!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What was happening to Jennifer? I love her so much.&amp;quot; I was gasping for breath. &amp;quot;I am so, so, so very stupid.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I mentally beat myself unmercifully, before forcing my mind to calm so I could find the car. I wasn&amp;#39;t doing my wife any good like this." />
