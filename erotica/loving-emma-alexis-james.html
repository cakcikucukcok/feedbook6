  <title>Loving Emma - Alexis James</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Liam Mathers is barely living his so-called life, running from the past and drowning his sorrows in too many women and an over-abundance of booze. Hiding from the pain of losing his first love, hell do whatever is necessary to avoid commitment or to admit he needs help. 
When he meets Emma Matticelli he knows one thing for certain; he needs to stay far, far away from her. Emma is smart and kind and beautifulthe type of woman who deserves a white picket fence and a husband. Although he is instantly attracted to the dark-eyed Italian beauty, Liam refuses to admit it to himself or to anyone else. He has no desire to start a relationship with anyone ever again. Hed had love once and lost it in the worst possible way. 
Emma leads a busy life and certainly has no time for love. But when she meets Liam shes instantly smitten.and very, very irritated. He may have an enticing set of haunting blue eyes and lips she wants to nibble on, but his cold behavior toward her is puzzling. Theres so much unspoken pain lurking deep inside of him that she cant help but want to gain his trust and be his friend. 
Friendship is easy. Love, however, can break you completely." />
