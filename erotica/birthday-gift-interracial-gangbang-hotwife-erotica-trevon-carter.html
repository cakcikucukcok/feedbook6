  <title>Birthday Gift (Interracial Gangbang Hotwife Erotica) - Trevon Carter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lily is an overworked, tired housewife with two kids. On her birthday, her husband, Paul, gives her a note to meet him at a shady motel. She wonders what gift could possibly be waiting for her at the motel. She remembers joking about swinging with a black couple while the two were drunk and wonders if her husband has a sexy gift in mind for her.
After a quick trip to the gym, she heads to the motel and walks into the room her husband texted to her... only to find three big black men awaiting her. Lily is soon surrounded by the three big black men who inform her that they are her gift. Lily&#39;s never been with a black man before, let alone three, and she&#39;s quite surprised by her husband&#39;s surprise gift. But, is her gift really from her husband or is a gift that she accidentally receives on her birthday?" />
