Perhaps his nephew and he could learn to share.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Are you sure Uncle Nigel says he wants us to move?&amp;quot; he hears her ask.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He does the first thing he thinks of, which is to hide in the walk-in closet and close the door as quietly as he can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sure,&amp;quot; Ryan answers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But... I like Uncle Nigel,&amp;quot; she murmurs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I know,&amp;quot; Ryan growls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You like Uncle Nigel too, don&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot; She sounds so innocent with the question too, as though she hadn&amp;#39;t spent the night earlier in his lap.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not the same way as you, darling,&amp;quot; he responds. There&amp;#39;s a fond smile on his lips, like the thought of her wanting him doesn&amp;#39;t bother him. It&amp;#39;s a peculiar thought, one that makes him wonder about its implications. Wolves don&amp;#39;t normally share their mates, but he&amp;#39;s heard about polygamous relationships amongst rabbit shifters often. Their high sex drives mean they usually take more than one lover at a time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Did he say anything to you?&amp;quot; she asks, timid and unsure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He wonders if she will tell him about what she tries to do the day before. Would she be too embarrassed to admit it. To his surprise, she continues.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I went to find him yesterday, after the girls and I went out drinking,&amp;quot; she admits before he could answer. &amp;quot;I um... I asked him to something inappropriate.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He hears the low growls from the other wolf and the swift sound of someone being pinned hard against the wall, followed by her sharp gasp.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Ryan?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You belong to me,&amp;quot; Ryan snarls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nigel feels his fangs lengthen in his mouth, pricking his lips. He almost gives himself away, but Ryan reacts first.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry. I didn&amp;#39;t- I didn&amp;#39;t mean that. Ari, Ari, I&amp;#39;m sorry. Are you okay? I didn&amp;#39;t hurt you, did I? I&amp;#39;m so sorry, baby.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She sniffles softly. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m okay. That wasn&amp;#39;t very nice Ryan.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I know. I know. I&amp;#39;m sorry, baby.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You know what I am. I told you since we were kids that you would have to share me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nigel inhales sharply. So, his dear nephew isn&amp;#39;t as ignorant as he thought. It&amp;#39;s why he has been hesitant to mate her properly. He knows that once she has a taste, she would want more, crave more than he is able to give... and he is not ready to share her just yet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry,&amp;quot; he says. &amp;quot;I know, I know I haven&amp;#39;t been giving you what you need. It&amp;#39;s why we&amp;#39;re here,&amp;quot; he says.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You are?&amp;quot; she asks, sounding so uncertain." />
