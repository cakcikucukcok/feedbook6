  <title>My Son, The Genius - Ona Dare</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#39;m rich, heiress to my grandfather&amp;#39;s fortune. And I want my son, sexually. I&amp;#39;ve wanted him for a long time but it isn&amp;#39;t until he begins studying all manner of sexual acts and kinks, that I am stimulated beyond holding back any longer. My son is a genius and he wants to learn everything about sex...and he wants it with me. And, God help me, I&amp;#39;m going to give him everything he wants and more. We have the time and freedom my money can buy. Mmmmm...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;There you are, darling. I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for you. Would you like to go out for lunch? It&amp;rsquo;s such a nice day.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, Mom. I&amp;rsquo;m working.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;On porn?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, I&amp;rsquo;ve become fascinated with sex, the more unusual the better. Did you know that some people will do everything they can to breach every orifice in their bodies? Look at this guy sticking rods in his cock until the hole is stretched out as far as he can get it. It looks delicious and I&amp;rsquo;m going to try it. Did you put my monthly allowance in my account yet? I&amp;rsquo;ve got a lot of stuff to purchase to try everything that looks so fucking stimulating.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You never go out, Michael. Who will you do all these things with?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, I thought you would be willing to participate. You&amp;rsquo;ve always been very supportive in everything I do. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think this would be so different. Do you mind?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do I mind? Oh, hell no, I don&amp;rsquo;t mind! I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted my son for a long while now but would never cross that boundary with him. But, oh, how I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted him to approach me. How many dreams have I had about him becoming my lover? Hundreds?" />
