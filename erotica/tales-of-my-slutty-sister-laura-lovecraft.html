  <title>Tales Of My Slutty Sister - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cole is obsessed with his sister Samantha. As a release for his frustration he&amp;#39;s been writing about his fantasies and posting them on an erotica site. There, he portrays his good girl sister as a ditzy slut he tricks and blackmails into nasty sex. Cole knows it&amp;#39;s wrong, but it&amp;#39;s not like Samantha will see them, right? Wrong! Samantha just found his stories and she&amp;#39;s not happy...or is she?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hey,Cole, you have a minute?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Sure, you feel okay?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No, not really.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She might not feel right, but she looked fine. Samantha wore a pair of pink spandex shorts with a skintight Hello Kitty top that like the rest of her work shirts&amp;#39; left her stomach bare.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;#39;d tried to look quickly, but couldn&amp;#39;t help staring at her chest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She wasn&amp;#39;t wearing a bra.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was unable to avoid gawking at her, and blushed when she asked, &amp;quot;Everything okay with you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah, yeah!&amp;quot; He managed to get his eyes to her face where he noticed her lips were painted a deep red, and she wore hot pink eye shadow, and added some blush to her cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Samantha rarely wore make-up and never this heavy. He wondered if she were skipping work to go out with her friends.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She pointed to his bed. &amp;quot;Sit down, I need to ask you something.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay.&amp;quot; He tossed his shorts on the bed and sat down next to them. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s up?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s a funny question.&amp;quot; She said, but without a smile. &amp;quot;Cole, how do I look?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Fine, I guess.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Like this outfit?&amp;quot; She did a slow turn, and he swallowed hard at how the snug shorts left the tip of her ass cheeks exposed. When she stopped, he noticed her I-Pad in her left hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s okay for your job. Not sure Dad would let you go anywhere else in it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I was thinking of wearing this to Trish&amp;#39;s party next week. Figured I&amp;#39;d start wearing my work clothes wherever I go. See how much attention I get.&amp;quot; She smiled, but something about it, had him on edge. &amp;quot;Think I&amp;#39;ll get it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d say so.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Good,&amp;quot; she walked slowly over to him. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re my brother so if you think it looks good, other guys will, right?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If that&amp;#39;s what you want.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What I want is to know what you think.&amp;quot; She stepped up between his legs. &amp;quot;I thought Hello Kitty was your favorite?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t remember saying that.&amp;quot; At least not to her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I know it&amp;#39;s meant for kids, but it can look hot to, right?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Depends on the girl.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What about this girl?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Um, well...&amp;quot; How to play this? &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s with not wearing a bra?&amp;quot; he gambled. &amp;quot;Dad and Mom would be apeshit they saw you out of the house like that.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Then maybe I should just stay here.&amp;quot; She put her hand on his shoulder. &amp;quot;Hang out with my little brother.&amp;quot; She put her lips to her ear. &amp;quot;Could be fun, spending time together. You like hanging with your big sis, right?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Did you just toke up?&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This close he could smell her perfume and her lips were so close to his ear he could feel her warm breath.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His heart raced and he had the insane thought that he was in one of his own stories.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Nope, I feel fine.&amp;quot; She squeezed his bicep. &amp;quot;So do you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s going on?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Nothing. Can&amp;#39;t a girl want to get close to her brother?&amp;quot; She sighed in his ear and the sound gave him goosebumps." />
