  <title>What Mom Really Wants - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sandra and her son Jeremy were always close, especially after her husband passed away. Then along came Heather who took Jeremy away with her to North Carolina. All Heather has to offer is the one thing Sandra can&amp;#39;t give her son: sex. Or can she? It&amp;#39;s Mother&amp;#39;s Day and Jeremy asks what she really wants. The answer is simple. What Mom really wants is for Jeremy to be her man of the house. In every way!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Enough, mom!&amp;quot; Jeremy snapped with uncharacteristic anger. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re making this really awkward.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry.&amp;quot; What the hell was wrong with her? Where was she going with that? &amp;quot;Guess I have porn on the brain today.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah, and about that.&amp;quot; He looked away nervously. &amp;quot;Mom, I need to ask you something.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here it comes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What is it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We know what happened. We know what I saw and it was a lot.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And I&amp;#39;m sorry, honey. I really am.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;My fault.&amp;nbsp; I shouldn&amp;#39;t have barged in your room. I should have called and said I was here.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s okay, you didn&amp;#39;t know what I was doing.&amp;quot; She rolled her eyes. &amp;quot;Not like I could say, when I hang up I&amp;#39;m going to...you know.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay, so it&amp;#39;s not about whose fault. Like you said, you&amp;#39;re a single woman and have needs.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;So what did you want to ask me?&amp;quot; As if she didn&amp;#39;t know.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;So when I was standing there the movie was playing and the woman was calling herself mommy.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sandra looked down and wanted to kick herself for doing it. Talk about admission of guilt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Catching you naked and getting off was embarrassing, but one of those things that we&amp;#39;ll laugh off and down the line.&amp;quot; He went on into her silence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But that was a mother son porn scene. I know there&amp;#39;s a lot of that stuff out there. I&amp;#39;ve seen them on sites I browse, but I&amp;#39;ve never watched one.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Look, Jeremy I know how it looks.&amp;quot; She made herself look at him. &amp;quot;But it&amp;#39;s just a movie. I was looking for something to watch and I saw Molly Minx and she&amp;#39;s a favorite of mine because she&amp;#39;s not young.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;She also does nothing but step mom and real mom movies.&amp;quot; He kept his eyes on hers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;For someone who doesn&amp;#39;t watch it, you know enough about her.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I watch porn and I saw her on a hottest milfs special. They did interviews before the scenes and she talked about how she&amp;#39;s the best mommy in porn.&amp;quot; He raised his eyebrows in the identical way she always did when making a point. &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t watch the video because at that point I knew what it would be.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay, fine. So what?&amp;quot; Sandra struggled to sound indignant. &amp;quot;I think she&amp;#39;s hot, I like older women with younger guys and as far as the mommy thing goes? It&amp;#39;s just dialogue. I watch for the action, not the words.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Really?&amp;quot; He looked skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s just like when you like a song for the music, but really don&amp;#39;t listen to the words.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jeremy continued to look dubious.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;So you&amp;#39;re telling me that&amp;#39;s all there is to it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What else would there be?&amp;quot; Sandra put on another Oscar worthy performance, by narrowing her eyes and in a shocked tone asked, &amp;quot;God, Jeremy, you don&amp;#39;t think I would ever think of you do you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He quickly looked away. &amp;quot;I...of course not. It just caught me the wrong way. I mean when it comes to porn or any movie or book or anything people seek out their fantasy and what they want.&amp;quot;" />
