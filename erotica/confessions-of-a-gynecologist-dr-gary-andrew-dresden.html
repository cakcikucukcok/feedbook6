  <title>Confessions of a Gynecologist - Dr. Gary Andrew Dresden</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Dresden leaves no stone unturned as he navigates through the exciting world of the development and practice of an obstetrician and gynecologist. From start to finish, his story is wrought with startling revelations and shocking exposes.&lt;/P&gt;	&lt;P&gt;His journey uncovers the needs, hopes, anticipations and expectations of men who choose to become physicians and, later on, obstetricians and gynecologists. He deals, without evasion, with the compromises that must be made in a physician&#39;s personal life in order to first learn and then practice his chosen profession.&lt;/P&gt;   &lt;P&gt;He explores, in stark detail, the life experiences that motivate men to strive to serve women&#39;s medical needs. He uncovers the self-serving and abusive nature of medical training and the resultant waste, inefficiency and danger. He confronts the flaws and dangers in the medical delivery system that threaten our expectation of quality medical care.  He exposes the rot, self-interest and hypocrisy that pervade the political power structure of hospitals and medical societies. Lastly, he uncovers the power that drug companies can exert to control the pricing and delivery of pharmaceuticals and concomitantly keep physicians in line.&lt;/P&gt;                                    &lt;P&gt;The task is monumental and the author has met the challenge.&lt;/P&gt;" />
