  	<div class="indent justify" style="visibility:hidden"><b><i>Dangerous Passion - Lisa Marie Rice</i></b> | Dangerous Passion is very much a typical Lisa Marie Rice book. Her hero, Viktor “Drake” Drakovich is a man living on the edge. He is cold, calculating and even though he has the whole world at his fingertips, he is an empty shell of a man. Drake is a nomad who has no place to call his own. He is a borderline villain because his past is a murky one.<br /><b><i>Dangerous Passion (Dangerous, #3) by Lisa Marie Rice</i></b> | I enjoyed Dangerous Passion, but I like Lisa Marie Rice's style. She doesn't deviate from her winning formula. But be forewarned: it is formula. If you've read Rice before, you know this couple. Drake is dangerous, filthy rich, and alone. Grace is loving, cultured, and gentle. They need each other desperately.<br /><b><i>Amazon.com: Dangerous Passion (The Dangerous Trilogy ...</i></b> | Of course, Lisa Marie Rice is a virtual woman and exists only at the keyboard when writing erotic romance. She disappears when the monitor winks off.<br /><p><h3 align="left">Download Ebook|PDF|Epub of <a href=>Dangerous Passion - Lisa Marie Rice</a> </h3></p><hr/>
