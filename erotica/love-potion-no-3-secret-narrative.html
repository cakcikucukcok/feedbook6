  <title>Love Potion No. 3 - Secret Narrative</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Love Potion No. 3: An Anthology of Provocative Erotica&lt;br /&gt;
Featuring a collection of exotica designed to turn you on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kiss From A Ghost by Elizabeth Woodham&lt;br /&gt;
No matter where it starts, a story must have a hero. A journey. A story of love lost and found again. People adore making comparisons or to invent an artificial existence. Does anyone really know what is going on in anyone else&amp;rsquo;s world? When Chloe Merrywell meets army medic, Dan Archer, her deepest nature is gradually transformed. Chloe embarks upon a journey of discovery and awakens to the delights of faithful sex. She unravels her past from her convent school education and the taste of girls to her seduction at the hands of charismatic Nicholas Kamarovsky. Chloe&amp;rsquo;s lifetime of learning isn&amp;rsquo;t easily undone; her former lovers taunt and tempt and she&amp;rsquo;s torn. The taste of her best friend Suzanne lingers and stimulates the memory of Sister Nuria as Chloe struggles to embrace convention and turn her back on the past for good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Savannah by Daniella Cerveny&lt;br /&gt;
Daniella Cerveny describes the metamorphosis of her marriage as she and her husband embark on their swinging, sexual awakening in a series of stunning truths straight from Daniella&amp;rsquo;s big heart. She&amp;rsquo;s unafraid and is willing to try anything at least once. Accompany Daniella and husband Todd as they swing their way through a string of hot, searing sessions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Generation Game by Secret Narrative&lt;br /&gt;
Sixty-something university lecturer, Sylvia Kent explores age-gap sex, and her new-found desire for steamy encounters with strangers, students, and colleagues. Explosive exploratory sex with teenage men." />
