  <title>Mommy Won&#39;t But I Will - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Over the last year Wayne&amp;#39;s sex life has gone from hardly ever to not at all. He has no idea why; he&amp;#39;s a hard worker, good father, and has always treated his wife Val with love and respect. But when he tells her he&amp;#39;d like a little appreciation, it just leads to another fight. That&amp;#39;s when his sexy young daughter Jodie steps in and shows her daddy some appreciation. Because if Mommy won&amp;#39;t, she will!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Everything okay?&amp;quot; She seemed genuinely confused. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not late.&amp;quot; Jodie looked down at herself. &amp;quot;You mad about my outfit?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Jodie!&amp;quot; He snapped. &amp;quot;Stop acting like you don&amp;#39;t know what you did!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She met his gaze, and he was stunned when a smile played about her lips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You talking about last night?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes!&amp;quot; He wanted to slap his forehead. &amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t think there was anything wrong with what you did?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t think so,&amp;quot; a look of concern spread across her face. &amp;quot;I thought I did a good job.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wayne stared at her trying to keep his mouth from falling open.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You really seemed to like it.&amp;quot; She sounded as if she were talking about something she&amp;#39;d made for dinner. &amp;quot;Was I bad at it?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You...&amp;quot; This was becoming something out of an X-rated version of the Twilight Zone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry, if I didn&amp;#39;t make you feel good,&amp;quot; she was beginning to sound upset.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;So you&amp;#39;re fine with what you did?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;As long as I made you happy.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Jodie,&amp;quot; Wayne sighed. &amp;quot;You make me happy every day. I couldn&amp;#39;t ask for a better daughter.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Thank you,&amp;quot; she said softly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But honey, I&amp;#39;m your father and you just don&amp;#39;t do that.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jodie giggled, and it was the same giggled from last night, and sent an immediate and unwanted thrill through him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s so funny?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You said do that&amp;#39;,&amp;quot; Jodie looked up at him with a grin. &amp;quot;I gave you a blow job.&amp;quot; She laughed. &amp;quot;Who&amp;#39;s the kid here?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t talk like that, I&amp;#39;m your father.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I know that, but you&amp;#39;re also a man, and I&amp;#39;m a woman and...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re eighteen!&amp;quot; He rolled his eyes. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not a woman,you&amp;#39;re my little girl.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Do I look like a little girl?&amp;quot; She winked. &amp;quot;I saw you looking me up and down. You see a little girl in front of you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I wasn&amp;#39;t checking you out, I was thinking you&amp;#39;re showing a little too much,&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And not minding it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Jodie, don&amp;#39;t get smart with me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Sorry.&amp;quot; She shrugged. &amp;quot;I shouldn&amp;#39;t have tricked you.&amp;quot; It wasn&amp;#39;t quite the admission he was looking for, but at least she&amp;#39;d admitted something was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But if I didn&amp;#39;t you would have never let me,&amp;quot; she winked. &amp;quot;Do that.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re sitting here talking like you baked a cake.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I did get to lick the frosting,&amp;quot; she giggled.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not funny. Jodie this was as wrong as wrong gets.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Fine, Dad, fine!&amp;quot; Jodie exclaimed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;I know it&amp;#39;s wrong and most people would say it&amp;#39;s flat out disgusting. I gave my father a blow job, and tricked him into it. It was low and sleazy, and I should be ashamed of myself.&amp;quot; She lifted her chin defiantly. &amp;quot;But I&amp;#39;ve decided you need to be taken care of, and if Mommy won&amp;#39;t, I will.&amp;quot;" />
