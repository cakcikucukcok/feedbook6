  <title>Truth or Dare - Delilah Dawson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Kai Armstrong has been secretly watching Sonya Drummond for weeks. Not because her sexy curves drive Kai wild. Not because her every move sets his body on fire. Kai&#39;s watching Sonya because she&#39;s in possession of a stolen butterfly necklace--and he&#39;s been hired to steal it back, even if he has to seduce it right off her beautiful neck...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sonya meets Kai on a single&#39;s cruise, she has no idea that he&#39;s looking for the necklace. She assumes he&#39;s there for the same reason she is: to indulge in a weeklong shipboard sex romp, no strings attached. Kai is the perfect candidate for what Sonya has in mind: Tall and gorgeous with a dark, muscular body that just won&#39;t quit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Sonya, Kai finds himself oddly off his game. Her shy blushes remind him of chocolate raspberries and her shivers drive him out of his mind! As things heat up, Kai must make a decision: Will he betray the woman who has captured his mind and body...or give in to a delicious game where everybody wins?&lt;/p&gt;" />
