  <title>Captives of Doctor Sodom - Kristine Lichtlider</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Earnest good girl and Space Fleet cadet Alexia Faith returns for more kinky adventures on Station 3x69. This time, she is sent on an undercover mission for Space Fleet intelligence to find the mysterious Dr. Sodom. Along the way she encounters tentacle sex, bondage, lesbian love, and an amorous android. Can she escape the clutches of Dr. Sodom in time to study for her next exam? Or is she doomed to be his plaything forever?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I need you to disrobe,&amp;rdquo; Phibes said without turning around.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Of course you do,&amp;rdquo; Alexia said, sighing. She knew better than to try to argue with Dr. Phibes, who had a way of twisting your own words around on you. Hooking her fingers under the hem of her skirt, she lifted the uniform off of her head and laid it carefully over the back of a chair. In a moment she&amp;#39;d shimmied out of her pink brassiere and panties, and planned to take off her boots when Phibes shook his head.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You can leave the boots on,&amp;rdquo; he said &amp;ldquo;they won&amp;#39;t interfere with the operation of the device. Here, we need to get you situated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What do you mean, get me situated&amp;mdash;oh, no!&amp;rdquo; Alexia said, wide eyes staring in alarm at the familiar micro mesh straight jacket.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We have to minimize damage to the ambassador,&amp;rdquo; Dr. Phibes said, lifting her numb arm and sliding the first sleeve up to her shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, darn it!&amp;rdquo; Alexia said, though she didn&amp;#39;t resist as Phibes slipped her other arm into the jacket. He stepped behind her and pulled on the straps dangling off the ends of the sleeves. Alexia obligingly folded her arms under her breasts as Phibes pulled the straps taut. Kelly watched with acute interest, eyes glassy and lips slightly parted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Where&amp;#39;s my jacket, Dr.?&amp;rdquo; Kelly asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Oh, it won&amp;#39;t be necessary for you to wear one,&amp;rdquo; Dr. Phibes said. He grunted, putting his knee in Alexia&amp;#39;s back as he pulled hard on the straps and cinched them tight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;#39;s snug!&amp;rdquo; Alexia cried out, nearing a panic. The jacket held her arms strapped to her body, and covered most of her torso above the waist, save cutouts for her breasts. Phibes pulled twin straps through her crotch, going on either side of her pussy, thus securing the coat tightly while allowing access to her most intimate area. &amp;ldquo;Does it have to be so tight?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;It&amp;#39;s medically necessary,&amp;rdquo; Dr. Phibes said. He picked up a long, smooth rod vaguely reminiscent of a penis with straps dangling from it. Phibes pushed a button on the end and it lit up with circuitry along its length. &amp;ldquo;This device will transmit physiological data to our computer. If all goes according to my calculations, the creature should be able to use your body&amp;#39;s responses to communicate.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;My body&amp;#39;s respon-ughk!&amp;rdquo; said Alexia as Phibes shoved the device deep into her mouth. The silicon rod&amp;#39;s tip tickled the back of her throat, making her gag as Phibes strapped it securely into place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;There we are,&amp;rdquo; Phibes said, taking Alexia by the shoulders and turning her to face the creature. &amp;ldquo;Now, do your duty, cadet!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Phibes shoved Alexia forward, making her stumble at a near run until Gphloryxmangallahcu&amp;#39;s olfactory senses detected her presence. A tentacle shot out and slithered around her waist, lifting her flailing legs off the floor. Alexia tried to scream, but the choking gag prevented her from doing anything but struggle to breathe. More tentacles slithered around her body and drew her toward the writhing mass.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The grasping tentacles slithered around Alexia&amp;#39;s breast...&lt;br /&gt;
