      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Your husband owes us a lot of money, Mrs. Joy&amp;hellip; Now, you could continue working eighteen hour days for the rest of your life, or you could come with me and settle the debt another way&amp;hellip; Who knows, this might actually be enjoyable for you.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;ldquo;What other way?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Why don&#39;t you come and find out?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Mrs. Joy,&quot; he said, opening the door forcibly and walking inside despite my protests. &quot;Your ex-husband owes as a hundred grand and I intend to collect.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gaped at him, opening and closing my mouth a few times. &quot;A hundred grand?&quot; I choked. &quot;What kind of idiot would lend him that much money?!&quot; I gasped before I could take it back. My blood ran cold as I waited for his response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He had made himself comfortable on my couch. The rain had misted the window completely, blocking the view of my neighbors. I closed the door quietly behind me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He chuckled low, &quot;Yes. I assure you. That &#39;idiot&#39; has been properly dealt with.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I kept my mouth shut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Mrs. Joy, I do intend to collect. Since Mr. Joy is not around, I&#39;ll collect from you,&quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Please stop calling me Mrs. Joy,&quot; I said. At his curious look, I added, &quot;My name&#39;s Alice.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He interlinked his fingers and turned his dark eyes at me, his expression carrying none of the mirth earlier. &quot;Now, you could continue working eighteen hour days for the rest of your life to pay off your husband&amp;mdash;sorry&amp;mdash;ex-husband&#39;s debt. Or you could come with me and settle the debt another way&amp;hellip; Who knows, this might actually be fun for you.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;What other way?&quot; I eyed him suspiciously, distrustful for good reason. My phone sat in the table between us and I wondered if I needed to call the police.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He grinned then, a cruel, slightly sadistic grin that sent shivers down my spine and solidified my thought that I wouldn&#39;t want to get on his bad side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Why don&#39;t you come and find out?&quot; he asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I&#39;d much rather not,&quot; I responded without thinking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Alice,&quot; he said standing up, towering over me easily as he stood in front of me. I leaned so far back against the couch that I wondered if it was going to swallow me whole. &quot;Alice, you seem to think this is some sort of discussion. I&#39;m offering you a way out of paying a hundred thousand dollars and possible earn a little more.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a fleeting thought of being caught in the airport with a luggage filled with illegal goods and shuddered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;When Mr. Joy comes back, I&#39;ll let him know he has to pay you,&quot; I tried again, choosing to stay strong despite the fact that he was radiating danger. Maybe I just didn&#39;t care anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I&#39;m willing to bet you will be changing your mind real soon, Mrs. Joy,&quot; he growled, leaning down so that his eyes met mine and our breaths mixed together. Our lips parted and we breathed each other&#39;s air. For a moment, I wondered if he was going to kiss me. It was absurd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Keep your distance, Nick,&quot; I said with as much venom as I can muster. He was intimidating, his strong arms on either side of my head, trapping me in my seat." />
