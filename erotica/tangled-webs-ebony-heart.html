  <title>Tangled Webs - Ebony Heart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are different philosophies women and men learn on their winding paths to dealing with relationships.
Cheyenne learned to get what you want you must use what youve got. She never heard the word no unless it came from her own lips. 
Lexi never let her wants and needs out of the mental box in which she kept them. Calling herself a rug for men to walk on was putting it lightly.
Devon was more common sense based than street sense. Women usually came into his life because of what he had and his looks, but he still failed to develop long lasting relationships because of his lack of emotional experience. 
Adrian felt that his players card was as much a part of him as his skin. Commitment was one word that could not be found in his vocabulary, followed quickly behind by fidelity.
Each one felt they were safe and hidden in their emotional homes. Then, fate or opportunity knocks. Who knows which? Nonetheless, whether opening the door or not means your days are numbered and youll be forced to deal with whatever is outside. 
Each of these people felt they had sufficiently protected their secret selves.
But, fate has plans for us all and will force us to deal with our real selfwhether we want to or not. 
Some cower and try to hide their secret deeper.
Some emerge like a butterfly and go on transformed.
Some will find themselves consumed by the raging fires of their own ignorance.
May it be emotional wreckage, caged introvert or sexually driven, most of us, like these four people, will find ourselves tangled in our own webs." />
