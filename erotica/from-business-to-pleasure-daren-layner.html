  <title>From Business to Pleasure - Daren Layner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When his most recent break-up leaves Hunter feeling like he&#39;s too nice of a guy, he decides that his next relationship is going to be on his terms - emotionally &amp; physically! He can see Jessica wants to try for a deep relationship-tempting!-but won&#39;t fall for any more lies. If she wants him to open up and share his heart with her, she&#39;s going to treat him right-or he&#39;ll drive her body past the point of reason! Jessica has pushed away every commitment her whole career, but now she&#39;s looking for more. Hunter is brooding with secrets and mysteries. She wants to love him the way he deserves, but only if she can survive the whirlwind of lust he inspires!  As he makes her desperate for more of his touch, he finds a way into her heart and shows her there is more to the game of life, as he enjoys her body and the chance at believing in someone again, and having something real! A steamy story of love, lust and ecstasy, these two find a way through their busy lives, all the way from Business... to Pleasure!" />
