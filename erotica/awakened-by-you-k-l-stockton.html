  <title>Awakened by You - K L Stockton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Skye Darcy is a highly successful workaholic artist, a superstar of the fantasy and science fiction genre she works in. Disowned and kicked out by her wealthy family at the age of eighteen, she has now, at the age of twenty-six, built a multimillion-dollar fortune from nothing by using her natural business aptitude and instinct. Preferring to concentrate on her work for years, she shied away from intimate relationshipsuntil she met Clayton Blake. The attraction is instant as he awakens her inner sex goddess and sense of sexual adventure, but at the same time, he makes her face a horror from her past. Can she overcome her innermost fears to explore and enjoy the sexual pleasures he promises to take her on?
Clayton Blakegood-looking, thirty years young, free, single, and billionaire. He thought he had it all, a loving, supportive family, an abundance of easily available women, and an extremely successful business. That was until Skye Darcy walked into his life, and everything in his world shifted. His burning lust and passion for her awakens and ignites emotions and pleasure like hes never experienced before; however, it also brings out a horror from her past he is determined to lay to rest. Will his love be strong enough to help Skye conquer her nightmare memories and fears?
Awakened by You follows Skye and Claytons journey of self-discovery, their developing relationship and sexual exploits. 
Come along for the ride, and experience it with them." />
