  <title>All Change: Gina Joy Book 3 - Maria Hooch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="With her husband out of prison and her life finally starting to make sense, Gina has one more shock to deal with. On the day comes home, Lara phones with news that will change the lives of everybody involved.  A taste of what&#39;s to come:  &quot;It&#39;s just me,&quot; Laurie hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. &quot;And my mum and dad. I hope you don&#39;t mind.&quot; &quot;That&#39;s fine. Where are they?&quot; &quot;They&#39;re in the car. Mum didn&#39;t want to spoil my homecoming by being in the way and dad wanted to finish listening to the piece of music on the radio.&quot; &quot;What was it?&quot; &quot;Hell knows,&quot; Laurie laughed. &quot;Something by Bach or Purcell, I think-one of the Baroque composers anyway.&quot; &quot;You&#39;re into classical music now?&quot; &quot;You&#39;re into cricket?&quot; he asked, nodding toward the cricket bat. &quot;That&#39;s a surprise for somebody who once said that hell would have had to, and I quote, &#39;not only freeze over but to be flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and then smashed with a hammer for good measure&#39; before she even considered watching it.&quot;" />
