  <title>Never Look Back - Roger Goldingay</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;She reached for me and her lips replaced Karla&#39;s. It was the first time I kissed her. It was a deep passionate kiss, the juice of her mouth hot, her tongue exploring. A moment later, I felt Karla kissing my neck, her busy fingers unbuttoning my shirt and rubbing my chest. I reached for her breasts and found them free and loose under her T-shirt. Diane straddled my thigh and rubbed her vee on my leg through our blue jeans&quot; 
&lt;p&gt;
&quot;We sat in awed silence, metamorphosing from points of light to prehistoric man fascinated with flame. For eternal nanoseconds we flitted back and forth. One moment we were the fire, no more than ethereal flame. Nothing but a flicker of light and everlasting energy. The next moment we sat outside it and saw the flame as God, our beneficiary, our protector from woolly behemoths. In pagan disorder we danced around the fire all night, our hearts racing with discovery.&quot;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Never Look Back&lt;/i&gt; is a novel that is breathtaking in its boldness and candor. As groundbreaking and colorful as Kerouac&#39;s &quot;On the Road&quot;, Roger Goldingay has written a book that records a window of time when adventure, exploration, sexual freedom, daring and challenge ruled the day." />
