  <title>For My Boys - Madame Gallivant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
A stay at a hotel turns into more than what Tabitha was expecting when a chance encounter with a young couple leads to some hard choices. Caught watching, Tabitha must do what she must do- for her boys.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Stacy then rose on her unsteady feet. Stepping completely out of her jeans, and her panties, she stood naked in the room with these three naked young men. She was covered in the sheen of her own sweat and the sweat from my boys, and she had a mix of their cum and her pussy juice dripping out of her little snatch and onto the dark blue-red checkered carpet of the hotel room.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Who are you?&amp;rdquo; she asked, suddenly looking directly at me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I, uh,&amp;rdquo; I stammered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why is it that every time I try and spy, I always keep getting caught?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;#39;s my girlfriend,&amp;rdquo; Destin said, lying as naturally as a used car salesman.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;#39;re girlfriend?&amp;rdquo; Kyle said, his eyes looking me over before staring into my own. He had the cold stare of a criminal almost, appraising me and what he could get from me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah,&amp;rdquo; Destin managed, his voice now sounding unsure, &amp;ldquo;My girlfriend, Tammy.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Huh,&amp;rdquo; Kyle said, &amp;ldquo;Well Tammy, did you like watching your boyfriend fuck my girl, huh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; I admitted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What was this young stranger going to expect from me?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Huh,&amp;rdquo; Kyle said, &amp;ldquo;Well, D, you owe me, man.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I owe you?&amp;rdquo; Destin asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah, you do,&amp;rdquo; Kyle said, friendliness seemingly evaporating from his persona, &amp;ldquo;You got to fuck Stacy, so you owe me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I told you, we don&amp;#39;t have any money,&amp;rdquo; Durrell said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;#39;t want money,&amp;rdquo; Kyle said, looking at me in the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So what do you want?&amp;rdquo; I asked, as I stood on the kitchenette floor.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I only want what is fair,&amp;rdquo; Kyle stated, &amp;ldquo;You fucked Stacy- you both fucked Stacy- so now I get to fuck your girlfriend.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;#39;t-&amp;rdquo; Destin began.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Look, man, this is going to go one of two ways,&amp;rdquo; Kyle said, his voice as cold as ice, &amp;ldquo;Either I am going to fuck Tammy here, or you are going to come up with some money. Nothing in life is free, D and D, nothing at all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t like the way this was going- not at all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have a weakness for younger men, and I&amp;#39;ll admit that to you. That doesn&amp;#39;t mean every man that is younger than me is someone that I would fuck. Kyle wasn&amp;#39;t fat, he wasn&amp;#39;t ugly, but he was mean looking. Durrell was rough around the edges, but the difference between Durrell and this stranger was that Durrell didn&amp;#39;t look like he would rob someone as soon as look at them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And I definitely did not want to fuck someone who was demanding it. Seeing his girlfriend sucking his cock as my boys fucked her was hot enough to make me cum- hey, I am a voyeur- but his order that I had to fuck him destroyed the slim chance he had at my pussy. If they had caught me while they were all fucking and sucking, I probably would have joined in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now, though, I wanted to throw him and his little bitch out on the street.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How dare he demand that I fuck him!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;She doesn&amp;#39;t have to do shit,&amp;rdquo; Durrell said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He was naked, but he had gotten off the couch; he wasn&amp;#39;t going to let this street person come in here and start pushing me around!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, mom, you don&amp;#39;t,&amp;rdquo; Destin blurted.&lt;br /&gt;
