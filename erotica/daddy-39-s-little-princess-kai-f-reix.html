  <title>Daddy&#39;s Little Princess - Kai F. Reix</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;rsquo;t find it a bit weird, since your father is sitting right next to you?&amp;rdquo; Jessica asked handing over the remote to Amy, who was stuck between us with her legs curled up in front of her, her head resting on her knees. &amp;ldquo;And shouldn&amp;rsquo;t you start dressing more seriously, by the way?&amp;rdquo; My wife was right, Amy&amp;rsquo;s choice of &amp;lsquo;pajamas&amp;rsquo; was very tempting. She was wearing only some panties and a short t-shirt. Just watching her gave me a hard on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly I felt something on my crotch area and I looked down, only to see Amy&amp;rsquo;s hand clutching the bulge over my pants. I panicked for a second and looked at my daughter, who glanced at me and raised a finger to her lips, signaling me to keep quiet and increased the pressure on her grip.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I cast my eyes in Jessica&amp;#39;s direction and I could see that she didn&amp;rsquo;t notice a thing, and she couldn&amp;rsquo;t even if she focused her attention on me because Amy blocked the view with her body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I could&amp;rsquo;ve push her hand away, or just stand up and leave the room, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Shit!&amp;rdquo; Jessica said and I stopped breathing and Amy&amp;rsquo;s hand stopped moving as well. I was getting ready for a drama when my wife said &amp;ldquo;Who the hell puts commercials in the middle of that kind of scene?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re right, Mom. I&amp;rsquo;ll change the channel and see if there&amp;rsquo;s something else.&amp;rdquo; Amy said with composure and picked the remote.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What, you&amp;rsquo;re into history now? Want to know how to handle a sword?&amp;rdquo; Jessica skeptically asked as Amy paused on a middle ages documentary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Why not, Mom?&amp;rdquo; she said seriously pushing her hand in my pants and her fingers took hold of my naked, hard flesh. &amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re knights, you see? And what is most important for a knight than a sharp sword?&amp;rdquo; Her hand slowly moved up and down my cock stroking it gently, but with a firm grasp. &amp;ldquo;How else would they be able to save their Lady, or&amp;hellip; Princess? Don&amp;rsquo;t you think so Daddy?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s right, honey. Every knight needs a sharp sword for the sake of his Lady, or Princess.&amp;rdquo; I said, enjoying the &amp;lsquo;sharpening&amp;rsquo; my little girl was giving to my &amp;lsquo;sword&amp;rsquo;." />
