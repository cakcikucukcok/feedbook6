  <title>Big Book of Spanking II -  Lizbeth Dusseau, Lizbeth Dusseau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="WOODSHED IN THE WOODS &amp; Other Stories Casey Birches finds out her back woods manners don&#39;t cut it with Jack. A few trips to the woodshed and she learns to mend her naughty ways. In the sequel, Casey&#39;s Arrangement, when the brat turns to Jack for help, the two go at it in his woodshed one more time. When a strong-willed Kate is forced to live with her Uncle in Kate&#39;s Burning Lessons, she must live down her mother&#39;s wanton reputation, and she endure discipline from Uncle and her tutor. Then, as Stuart tells his girlfriend, Karen, how he maintains discipline in his office, she can&#39;t wait for an Appointment of her own. And, in Another Time--Lauren is ready to face her feelings about the only man she&#39;s ever loved; even if it means surrendering to the spankings she&#39;s sure to get. REMEMBERING HOW IT ALL BEGAN and other stories.  In the title story, a bratty wife is spanked for her flagrant misconduct, and enjoys the erotic aftermath. In Submission, Lizbeth&#39;s letter to her friend details her remarkable relationship with her husband Edward, and the powerful spanking fantasy that drives her--startling, graphic and candid. And, One Summer, Jeremy advises his friend, Stephen, to spank his ill-tempered wife, just as he does his own. When the couples get together there are plenty of fireworks, both ladies going over their husband&#39;s knee. It&#39;s Plots, Schemes and Paddlings, when John Neville finds his progressive discipline methods don&#39;t work with the spirited hellions at Cassidy School. He&#39;s forced to use the time-honored &quot;school paddle&quot; to bring the wayward brats in line. In the sequel, Emily Gibbs, Paddled At Last, Neville&#39;s young secretary finds herself feeling that nasty paddle when she defies her boss; which only enhances the budding romance between she and John." />
