  <title>Christmas Joy: My Festive Mother - Justin Luxure</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Mike is coming home for the holidays and is greeted by his Mother, Joy and new husband Trevor. His Mom has gone through changes in her life and is now a total fox! The three years away from home has gotten to him and he starts to find himself attracted to his own Mother. Leading to a forbidden relationship they must keep hidden from their family during the holiday season.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Climbing out of bed, I headed past Todd&amp;rsquo;s bedroom and gingerly walked towards the stairs in hopes I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t wake anyone. The stairs creaked with each step, but not enough to jolt anyone from their slumber. Halfway down the stairs I noticed the glare of the Christmas tree lights against the wall, even though I distinctly remember unplugging them before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I stealthily continued down the stairs and peaked around the corner laying eyes on something I could only dream of. My Mother was bending over under the Christmas tree rustling around with the lights. She was wearing a sexy Christmas outfit with a red Santa skirt and red lace underwear. How did I know what kind of underwear she was wearing? The fabric was creeping up between her ass cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My foot slipped and banged on the ground; my Mother quickly stood up and I continued down the stairs as if I wasn&amp;rsquo;t there long. Quickly she flicked on the light and revealed her entire outfit. Her breasts wrapped tightly in a matching Santa Clause bra; her cleavage shining with a layer of sweat under the living room light. I was able to see her long smooth legs for the first time as she rested the palm of her hand on her hip; staring at me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What are you doing up?&amp;rdquo; she asked." />
