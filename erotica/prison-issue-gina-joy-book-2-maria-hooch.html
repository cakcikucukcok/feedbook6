  <title>Prison Issue: Gina Joy Book 2 - Maria Hooch</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Gina Joy receives a letter from the prison where her husband is currently locked up for drug dealing, her whole world is rocked to the core. She finally faces up to the reason why she hasn&#39;t seen him for the four years he has been in prison, but with so much change in her life she finds it hard to cope with the thought of having him back in her life.  A taste of what&#39;s to come:  &#39;I came to my senses and pulled his hand out of my shorts. There was a hint of regret in his eyes, but he looked away as Lara snatched the letter from his hand. &quot;Bloody hell, Gina! Why didn&#39;t you tell me about this?&quot; she demanded. &quot;First you finally decide that you&#39;re interested in your hunky neighbour and then you neglect to tell me that your husband has got a prison guard to write to you because you&#39;ve been ignoring him.&quot; &quot;I wasn&#39;t ignoring him,&quot; I told her. &quot;Actually, that&#39;s not entirely accurate. I was ignoring him, but only because I wasn&#39;t prepared to drag my kids across the country to visit him.&quot;&#39;" />
