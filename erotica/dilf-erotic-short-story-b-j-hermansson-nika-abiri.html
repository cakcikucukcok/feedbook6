  <title>DILF - Erotic Short Story - B. J. Hermansson, Nika Abiri</title>
      <meta name="description" content="There are MILFs, and then there are DILFs...
&quot;And I held his cock in my hand. Stroking it, I alternated between a fast and a slow pace. I rubbed his tip. Moistened my fingers, caressed his cock and watched it get wet and slick. I rubbed my pussy against him, held his erection unbelievably close without really feeling me. Without penetrating me. Yet.&quot;
Leon, Aaron and Raphael. They all have a few things in common. They’re older, experienced and off limits. But most importantly, they’re dads. DILFs: Dads I’d Like to Fuck.

DILF is an erotic short story about a desire and longing for the forbidden." />
