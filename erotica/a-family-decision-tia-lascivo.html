      <meta name="description" content="Mom gets a shocking offer to make a porn movie with her family.&amp;nbsp; It&amp;#39;s too great an offer to resist. She has to pitch it to her family, but there&amp;#39;s a lone voice of dissent they have to overcome. What will they do?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Makes you uncomfortable, huh?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jerome avoided his father&amp;#39;s eyes when Ralph asked the question. He nodded and grimaced and said, &amp;quot;Yeah. Mom in the nude&amp;nbsp; and my sister&amp;nbsp; I shouldn&amp;#39;t be exposed to that, dad.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Your mom&amp;#39;s forty-five,&amp;quot; Ralph said quietly. &amp;quot;She works out a lot, really watches her diet. It&amp;#39;s important to her to look good.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Maybe,&amp;quot; Jerome said in a petulant tone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And she does look good, you can&amp;#39;t take that away from her. She&amp;#39;s smoking hot, Jerry.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Da-ad,&amp;quot; Jerome groaned at his father. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m your son. This is inappropriate on a whole bunch of levels. You shouldn&amp;#39;t talk to me about mom that way.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ralph chuckled and shook his head in wry amusement. &amp;quot;Okay,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;maybe you&amp;#39;re right. But your mom and your sister are certainly making a hit. I think every guy out here is checking them out.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Appalled by his father&amp;#39;s casual acceptance that men were blatantly eyeing up his wife and daughter, Jerome gasped, &amp;quot;And you don&amp;#39;t care? Jesus, dad--&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t say I don&amp;#39;t care, but I sure don&amp;#39;t mind, Jerry. I trust your mom. I trust her completely. If guys want to look at my wife, let them look. I bet they&amp;#39;re envious of the guy who gets to take your mom home. And that would be me.&amp;quot; Jerome&amp;#39;s father grinned and pointed to his own chest. &amp;quot;And your mom will look after your sister,&amp;quot; he added. &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re perfectly fine.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Which is when the creepy old guy detached himself from the group close to where Jerome&amp;#39;s mom and sister were walking." />
