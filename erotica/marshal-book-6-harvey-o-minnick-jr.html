  <title>Marshal Book 6 - Harvey O. Minnick Jr.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is a well-written adult science fiction superhero adventure with a little humor thrown in. If you believe in aliens, you can believe in Marshal and his crew of superheroes as they try to protect Earth from a never-ending stream of threats, including humans. Life on Earth has never been quite the same after the coming of Marshal, and this is the sixth book in the series, but it is written to bring new readers up to speed. 
The story takes place in current-day Chicago, Illionois; Danville, Virginia; and on an exotic alien planet. 
I write to entertain. I try to put you in the middle of the action. You will know what is going on, how it feels, sounds like, and experience the emotions of the characters. 
The book is self-censoring for more sensitive readers, warning them in advance, giving the reader the option to read on and experience all the blow-by-blow action or allowing them to read on a little and then skip to the next break to pick up the action." />
