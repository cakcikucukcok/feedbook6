  <title>As Bad As Can Be (Mills &amp; Boon Blaze) (Under the Covers, Book 2) - Kristin Hardy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="
        &lt;p&gt;Having Bad Reputation is Mallory Carson&#39;s dream come true. The bar represents something of her very own.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;And thanks to her, it&#39;s the trendiest spot in town. At first, she and the other female bartenders dancing atop the bar counter was a one-off, a joke, but when it causes carloads of patrons to show up, Mallory sees the potential in terms of large dollar signs. She thinks all lights are flashing green and all signs read Go. Little does she know about the guy who&#39;s got his eye on her….&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Shay O&#39;Connor has his own quiet Irish pub nearby, unlike Mallory&#39;s roaring place. He&#39;s meant to be looking out for Mallory and her new business adventure on the Q.T. But after seeing her hot body and cool attitude in motion, he wants to keep a lot more than just his eye on her…. Problem number one is that she&#39;s his good buddy&#39;s sister. Family means a lot to Shay–he&#39;s the third generation to run O&#39;Connor&#39;s. Little does he know, however, that Mallory already plans to bed him!&lt;/p&gt;
