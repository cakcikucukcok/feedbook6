      <meta name="description" content="Joan is divorced and horny, the only outlet for her sexual cravings watching kinky videos on the internet. but when she discovers her only son is a virgin, fantasy is rapidly transformed into reality. Joan is going to take her son Jerry to bed, because she got &amp;quot;Mom&amp;#39;s Virgin Urge!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Christ, this is uncomfortable.&amp;quot; She squirmed irritably. The headboard of the bed seemed to be drilling a hole into the back of her skull, even through the pair of pillows which propped her up. And the straps of her bra were digging into her skin. &amp;quot;Oh, to hell with it.&amp;quot; With a practiced move, she slid her hands behind her back and popped the hooks of her bra. In seconds, it was hanging loose, and she snaked the constrictive garment out from under her sweater.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh, that feels good,&amp;quot; she sighed. Unthinkingly, she rubbed the undersides of her breasts, where the bra-cups had worn a groove into her flesh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; she demanded as she caught Jerry&amp;#39;s uncomfortable glance. &amp;quot;Try wearing one of those things for fifteen or sixteen hours a day, and see how you like it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not that,&amp;quot; he muttered. Then she saw the direction of his look, and understood. Well, crap. Her cashmere sweater was loosely knit, designed to keep the wearer cool on warm days or indoors. As a result, peeks of her skin could be seen through the tiny gaps in the weave. And her areolae, erect after an afternoon in her son&amp;#39;s presence, were obviously&amp;nbsp; indeed, one might say spectacularly&amp;nbsp; visible, poking up like erasers on the tip of a pencil.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;Do they make you uncomfortable?&amp;quot; she asked quietly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What? No!&amp;quot; But he still wouldn&amp;#39;t look at her for more than a second at a time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Jerry.&amp;quot; She made her voice firm. &amp;quot;Jerry, look at me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her son&amp;#39;s face was beet-red as he met her gaze. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the matter, honey? I know you&amp;#39;ve seen me like this before. What&amp;#39;s changed?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He sighed. &amp;quot;Oh, I don&amp;#39;t know.&amp;quot; His jaw clenched. &amp;quot;Last night, I guess. I&amp;#39;d been looking forward to it for weeks. And then the rug was pulled out from under me, you know?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re just boobs, Jerry.&amp;quot; Her voice was tinged with exasperation. &amp;quot;All women have them.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Sure. For you they&amp;#39;re just boobs.&amp;quot; His dark eyes gleamed with black humor. &amp;quot;But for guys, they&amp;#39;re the path to the promised land.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sudden understanding lit her mind. &amp;quot;And you&amp;#39;ve never seen one, have you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He twitched back, stung. &amp;quot;Of course I have!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Magazines and porno movies don&amp;#39;t count, Jerry. Or the internet.&amp;quot; She fixed him with a stern gaze. &amp;quot;Tell me the truth. Have you ever seen a bare tit in the flesh?&amp;quot; She smiled to take the sting out of her words.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Well...&amp;quot; he squirmed as she eyed him. &amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
