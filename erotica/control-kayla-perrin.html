  <title>Control - Kayla Perrin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Their romance was a modern-day fairy tale: handsome older millionaire falls for struggling young waitress. Robert swept Elsie off her feet&amp;#151;and into his bed&amp;#151;put a huge diamond on her finger and spirited her away in his private jet destined for happily-ever-after.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;Eight years later, Elsie Kolstadt realizes the clock has struck midnight. The five-star restaurants, exclusive address and exotic vacations can no longer make up for Robert&#39;s desire to control everything. From her hair to her music, Robert has things the way he wants them. No matter what.&lt;Br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;But it&#39;s Robert&#39;s ultimate, unforgivable manipulation that finally shocks Elsie into action. Though divorce would strip her of everything, she can&#39;t live under his roof any more. Making her decision easier is Dion Carter, a high-school football coach with a heart of gold and a body of sculpted steel. Suddenly Elsie is deep in a steamy affair that could cost her everything&amp;#151;because Robert will stop at nothing to keep her under his thumb." />
