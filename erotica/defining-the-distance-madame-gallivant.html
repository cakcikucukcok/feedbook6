  <title>Defining The Distance - Madame Gallivant</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Tabitha is not sure of how things are developing between her and her son. Is it Destin that turned her on so much, or was it just the excitement of being with a new man? And how will the nature of their unique relationship affect his development as a man? There is only one way to find out, to define the distance between them!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Bullshit,&amp;rdquo; Fiona said, &amp;ldquo;Seriously, though? You?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, serious,&amp;rdquo; I said, no nonsense in my tone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What made you finally do it?&amp;rdquo; she asked, the laughter replaced by pure curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I caught my son playing with himself, he caught me, and then we fucked; oh, and I sucked his best friend&amp;#39;s cock, too, while he was filling up my pussy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;#39;t know,&amp;rdquo; I lied, trying to backtrack my way out of this one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Tell me,&amp;rdquo; Fiona demanded, &amp;ldquo;So is he older, younger?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Younger,&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;Much younger.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;How young?&amp;rdquo; she asked, digging further, &amp;ldquo;Come on, tell me.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Eighteen,&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;Why?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You better be careful,&amp;rdquo; Fiona laughed, &amp;ldquo;I like them young, too, but that&amp;#39;s dangerous territory. Eighteen year olds don&amp;#39;t know how to keep their mouths shut.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You don&amp;#39;t want to leave Andrew, do you?&amp;rdquo; she asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No, I don&amp;#39;t,&amp;rdquo; I said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;#39;m bored with him, but I don&amp;#39;t want to leave him.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Well then you better get over it girl,&amp;rdquo; Fiona suggested, &amp;ldquo;If you don&amp;#39;t, you are going to end up wrecking your life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;#39;t do that,&amp;rdquo; I said, also true.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You must have feelings for him,&amp;rdquo; Fiona ruminated, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;#39;s really not good.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I do,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course I do- he&amp;#39;s my, son!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Be careful,&amp;rdquo; Fiona advised, &amp;ldquo;Is he the first man you fucked since Andrew?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You know the answer to that,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;#39;t blame you,&amp;rdquo; Fiona said, &amp;ldquo;It gets boring fucking the same man, day in and day out. But since he is the first, maybe you have feelings for him just because he is someone new and different.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So what should I do?&amp;rdquo; I asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Tread lightly, play carefully,&amp;rdquo; she said, &amp;ldquo;And go and try someone else. If you still feel so strongly about this new man, then keep doing what you&amp;rsquo;re doing. But tell him flat out that you ain&amp;#39;t going to leave your husband, and make sure you set the rules of the relationship. Is he married?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;No,&amp;rdquo; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;#39;s good and that&amp;#39;s bad,&amp;rdquo; she explained, &amp;ldquo;Good because you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about a jealous wife showing up at your door one day; bad because he&amp;#39;s just out of high school, and he&amp;#39;s probably in love with you, and he might show up at your door!&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oh he does- he&amp;#39;s one room down!" />
