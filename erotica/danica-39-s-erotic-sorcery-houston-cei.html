  <title>Danica&#39;s Erotic Sorcery - Houston Cei</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Danica is a benevolent witch who resides in an eerie Gothic house that rests on a large lot where she grows fruits, vegetables and herbs. She makes her Halloween treats and also serves her specially blended tea as an aphrodisiac for those in need.&amp;nbsp; Everyone leaves her house feeling upbeat and confident to face their problems. Danica&amp;#39;s powers include casting spells, telepathy and transformations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Is it possible to purchase cobra eggs?&amp;quot; she asked the charmer. Danica had an instant plan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Very unlikely,&amp;quot; he responded with an Indian accent. &amp;quot;The mothers guards their nests tenaciously.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; On the other hand, he saw the potential for a nice tip from the American tourist that was so curious about cobras.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the charmer was finished playing, he said that he could show her a mother cobra guarding her eggs, and commented, &amp;quot;We must be very careful. Cobras do not attack people unprovoked, and will surely strike if they feel threatened.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For a hundred dollar gratuity the charmer led her to the nest and upon approaching it, the mother cobra immediately reared up the anterior portion of her body and made a hissing sound similar to the growl of a dog. Danica had communicated with many birds and animals in her own yard but this would be her first attempt with a snake. She slowly went to her knees while looking directly into the eyes of dangerous snake that was preparing to strike in defense of her eggs. Danica then went down on all fours and slowly crawled closer and as her head was at about the same level as the snake&amp;#39;s head she channeled her thoughts to the thoughts of the snake:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Danica:&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt; I am not here to hurt you.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Snake:&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Why are you here?&amp;nbsp; I must protect my eggs. The young will be hatched in less than 30 days.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Danica:&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt; That is wonderful! It is very noble of you to protect them. What will happen when they are hatched?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Snake:&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;Then, they will be on their own and I can leave.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Danica:&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;That is very different from the ways of my species, but I know that nature has her ways. You are very beautiful.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Snake:&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Likewise, you are also beautiful.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Danica:&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Thank you!&amp;nbsp; I wish to be your friend.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Danica moved closer to the cobra that had ceased her hissing and relaxed her hood. The heads of the snake and Danica were now only inches apart. The snake&amp;#39;s forked tongue served as its sense of smell, and with that flicking tongue she licked Danica&amp;#39;s lips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The charmer was speechless and in awe of what he was witnessing; he had kissed many cobras on the top of the head at the end of his performances, but never had he let one lick his lips. Danica and the snake continued their mental conversation:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Snake:&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;We are not enemies with humans but we don&amp;#39;t make friends with the either. We may never see each other again after today. Why do you want to be my friend?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Danica:&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;You are right. We may never see each other again, but the memory of a friendship may endure throughout our lives.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Snake:&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Okay, I will be your friend. Is there something we can do to seal this friendship?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Danica:&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Yes, there is something. Is it not true that all of your offspring will not survive?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Snake:&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;That is most likely.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Danica:&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;Then, may I have two of your eggs to take back to my country to raise your offspring as my own?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Snake:&amp;nbsp; &lt;i&gt;That is a highly unusual request, but somehow it makes sense. Yes, you may have two of my eggs.&lt;/i&gt;" />
