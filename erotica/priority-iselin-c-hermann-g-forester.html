  <title>Priority - Iselin C. Hermann, G Forester</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Priority is a lovely and erotic exploration of intellectual admiration that develops into consuming passion. The novel begins as a young Danish woman, Delphine, writes a letter of thanks to Jean-Luc, a French painter whose work has touched her deeply. She is sure he will not read it - but he does, and he answers. Over the next eighteen months, a passionate correspondence evolves, and Delphine&#39;s letters bare her soul layer by layer, making her ever more vulnerable to his teasing replies and long silences. Helplessly, Delphine finds herself falling in love with a man she knows only through what he reveals in his letters. Her fascination with him begins to overwhelm her, until she begins to long for a lover she has never seen. Finally, it seems, a meeting may no longer be postponed.
Iselin C. Hermann was born in 1959. She earned a degree in Scandinavian literature at the University of Copenhagen, and has studied in France, Italy and Spain. This is her first novel.
