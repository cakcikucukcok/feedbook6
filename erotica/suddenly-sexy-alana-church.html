  <title>Suddenly Sexy - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jane Richardson&#39;s experiment has been incredibly successful. A medical researcher, her body is transforming to become more feminine, a result of her gene-splicing technique.
But her family wants to join the fun. Her two nieces convince her to try her procedure on them. What will happen when the three women realize the consequences of their actions? Because they are all...Suddenly Horny!
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
“What?” Zach stared at her, his mouth falling open. “Holy damn,” he breathed disbelievingly. “She...”
Colleen nodded. “She injected herself with genetic material from another woman. She hoped it would make her own breasts grow. And it worked.” She smiled triumphantly. “It worked, Zach!”
“So that&#39;s why her appetite has been through the roof lately?”
“Yes. Breasts are mostly made up of fat cells. And it takes a lot of food to generate fat. Especially if you have a body like a rake like she did. But in another week or two she&#39;ll have a set of D-cups. I saw them earlier today. They&#39;re beautiful.”
“Huh.” Zach turned the incredible story over in his mind. “Still, it&#39;s a risk. And she&#39;ll need more than one successful experiment to prove she&#39;s right.”
“We know,” Colleen said serenely. “That&#39;s why Lillian and I volunteered for the treatment, too.”
“You what?”
“We volunteered. To be honest about it, we practically blackmailed her into it, once we figured out what was going on. Aunt Jane injected us yesterday morning.”
“They&#39;re getting bigger now,” she said, a strange smile playing across her face. “I can feel it. My chest is sore. Tender to the touch.” She rubbed her breastbone with the heel of her hand, grimacing slightly. “In a week or two I&#39;ll have the breasts I&#39;ve always wanted.”
“It&#39;s pretty silly, if you ask me. Like I told you and Lillian and Aunt Jane the other day, you&#39;re all gorgeous. Why take such a big risk?”
“Because it&#39;ll make me happy. And I don&#39;t think I need to justify my decisions to you.” Her brows furrowed in a frown, as if she was just catching up in the conversation. “Wait. You think I&#39;m gorgeous?”
