  <title>Good Sport, Yellow Peril &amp; Lashed and Stowed - Straitjacketed</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Straitjacketed is attracted to kidnap and moderately long-term enclosure type bondage scenarios - especially when combined with heavy bike leathers, thick industrial rubber or layers of sweaty, shiny PVC or oilskin/raingear.   Having a distinctly exhibitionistic streak, he likes looking at hot photos of himself all tied up in gear - hence his stupidly vast array of uniforms and outfits. He also gets off on a slight edge of humiliation. Not Master/slave &quot;you pathetic worm&quot; type roleplay, but being mocked for failing an escapology challenge, then having no choice but to accept additional punishments or forfeits - or just being left to endure an uncomfortable situation because he hasn&#39;t managed to get out of it on his own.   This is a collection of 3 stories: Good Sport, Yellow Peril &amp; Lashed and Stowed." />
