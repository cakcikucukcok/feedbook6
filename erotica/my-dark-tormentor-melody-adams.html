  <title>My Dark Tormentor - Melody Adams</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;br /&gt;
A dark romance that transcends all boundaries of morality. Iwan is a dangerous criminal and he is a sadist. Sophia is his obsession. He will hurt her and he will push her limits. She is the only one who can give him what his dark heart demands. But can she save his soul?&lt;br /&gt;
Sophia:&lt;br /&gt;
The memory of Iwan falling to the ground is imprinted in my brain. But no matter how much I protest against Iwan&amp;#39;s bodyguards driving me from the scene to an unknown future, the armored limousine rolls on and on. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what will happen to me now. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;#39;ll ever see Iwan again. The man who abducted and tortured me is probably dead and instead of feeling relief, I feel a deep loss that breaks me apart.&lt;br /&gt;
Iwan:&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;#39;s no fun to be shot. When the second bullet knocks me down, I know my life is forfeit. My only consolation is that my Sophia is safe. I see the limousine move away from the scene. My men will take care of her. I just wish I had confessed to her how much I love her. This is my only regret before the world around me turns black.&lt;br /&gt;
