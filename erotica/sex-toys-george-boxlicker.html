      <meta name="description" content="For whatever reason, lack of men or lack of the right men or for something else, some men and women feel the need to provide their own orgasms. Here are 14 short stories of women who use toys or other methods to accomplish this. The writing is explicit so these stories are all intended for adults only.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Excerpt from &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;ldquo;Samantha and the Wind&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Samantha felt really good about herself when she walked out of her apartment building and onto the sidewalk that breezy spring morning. Wearing a light sweater and a pair of shorts and walking shoes, she exited through the front door and turned left. The shorts hung slightly below her bottom, with a very loose fit, and the dark green material was so thin that she could feel the wind cutting right through it. Other gusts swirled up the legs of the shorts, which were so loose, they flapped around her hips. In itself, that wasn&amp;#39;t unusual, but she felt the wind more acutely than she otherwise would have, because Samantha was completely naked under her outer garments.&lt;br /&gt;
She had chosen that day to go outside without her usual panties and bra, and she felt deliciously naughty, as the breeze penetrated the light fabric, tickling her bare crotch, which she had shaved just minutes earlier. Samantha was glad she was wearing her glasses; otherwise the strong breezes would have made her eyes water. Walking slowly, wanting to receive the maximum pleasure, she headed fully into the breeze, which fondled her in that most sensitive place, or found its way up the legs of the shorts to reach her from a different angle. A few of the other blasts of wind caressed her breasts under their almost non-existent covering, turning her nipples hard, and not just from the chill. Within a few minutes of starting her trek, Samantha could feel the wetness trickling from her, warm and pleasant at first, but cooling quickly when the wind focused on it.&lt;br /&gt;
Immensely relishing her walk, especially what the breeze was doing, she turned left at the corner and hurried down the short block to the next intersection, where she would turn left again. Samantha couldn&amp;#39;t feel any breeze tantalizing her sexually when she was on the narrow side street that connected the two main thoroughfares, and she wanted, as quickly as possible, to get to a place where she could. That breeze, and the effect it was having on her private parts, was her reason for being out on the street wearing such skimpy clothing with nothing but her bare skin under it.&lt;br /&gt;
Once she had made the second left turn, the breeze began sending thrills through her body again. This time it was blowing directly against her ass, which was just as bare under the shorts as her mound was. A few tendrils of more adventurous air even whooshed between her cheeks, teasing her rear end and contributing to the feeling she had of being wicked and wanton, as well as adding to the flow from her body. The wind and that feeling of wickedness were so erotically pleasing that she bent slightly from the hips, reveling in how much better the strong breeze blew through the fabric and worked its way up the legs of her shorts, to feel the way she wanted." />
