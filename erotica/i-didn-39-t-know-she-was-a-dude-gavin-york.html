  <title>I Didn&#39;t Know She Was A Dude! - Gavin York</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Chris is your stereotypical jock. He likes to party, he likes to play rough, and he likes to get laid. Problem is, he&amp;#39;s so big and handsome, no one can resist him. He&amp;#39;s partied, played, and laid his way over the last three years of college...and he&amp;#39;s bored. Enter Sam, an enigmatic, androgynous beauty that Chris just can&amp;#39;t ignore. Sam drives Chris wild with desire, and he&amp;#39;ll do anything to take her to bed. There&amp;#39;s just one hitch: Sam is a man! Being the macho hetero man he is, Chris knows he should be disgusted by his mistake...except he could never be disgusted by Sam. He wants the man with a mad passion he&amp;#39;s never felt before!&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
The night air hit us like a frigid kiss. Instantly, my nipples hardened under my Venus semi-sheer blouse, and the humidity of Saperstein evaporated like a distant dream. Without the bodies to block us, without the music to drown out our words, the silence and the space of the outside world hummed with illicit promise.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;My dorm&amp;#39;s just up the way,&amp;quot; I said. The logical part of my brain was screaming at me to drop his hand and run for the hills. My body refused to comply.&lt;br /&gt;
Chris squeezed my hand, and gazed into my eyes. &amp;quot;You sure?&amp;quot; He was so sincere... I hated him. I wanted him. I would have let him have me right there, up against the house, but I knew if that happened this would all be over. I wanted to prolong this feeling for as long as I could. It would make the truth more painful when it finally came out, but I&amp;#39;d never wanted a man this much. And I&amp;#39;d wanted. I couldn&amp;#39;t stop myself from wanting. I&amp;#39;d had lovers, men I liked and men I loved and men I outright loathed, but none so fine as him, none so thick and slick and smooth. Before we left the shadow of the house, I grabbed him again, pulled him down into a messy kiss.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Remember this,&amp;quot; I whispered into his lips. &amp;quot;Remember how much you like this.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
His big hands nearly encircled my waist. &amp;quot;You kidding? I&amp;#39;ll remember this the rest of my life.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You have no idea,&amp;quot; I muttered to myself. I was setting myself up for failure. For pain. I was too drunk, too horny. Inside the house, I knew Stella and the others would be trying to find me. They wanted to protect me. They wanted to protect me from myself, and from him. &amp;quot;Quick,&amp;quot; I hissed at him. &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s get out of here.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t have to tell me twice,&amp;quot; he said. He let me take his hand, and lead him from the housing quad.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re an idiot,&amp;quot; a voice inside me screamed. &amp;quot;Are you trying to get yourself killed?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
I wasn&amp;#39;t. I swear I wasn&amp;#39;t. I was trying to live. I was trying to live out the magic night he thought we were having. He thought I was some confident Snow White, wooed by his charm and his bluster.&lt;br /&gt;
It didn&amp;#39;t have to end in tragedy, I promised myself. I could tell him I didn&amp;#39;t do it on the first date. &amp;quot;Just give me tonight,&amp;quot; I prayed to the queer gods." />
