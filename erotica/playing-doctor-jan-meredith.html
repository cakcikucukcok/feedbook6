      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Playing Doctor by Jan Meredith&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;One night with a sexy stranger is just what the doctor ordered...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a fellow RN predicts Beth Roberts will meet a tall, ripped, and totally lick-o-licious stranger who will fulfill her deepest desires, she laughs it off. Given her tragic love life, Beth has no desire to become involved again. But who could have predicted the doctor with the mischievous smile she meets at a wedding, or the chemistry sparking between them that threatens to break through her defenses?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Gabriel North spent two years blaming himself for his wife&#39;s death. Having finally battled through the guilt and overcome his demons, he&#39;s ready to move on. When he meets a sexy nurse at his friend&#39;s wedding, the attraction is swift and strong, and he wastes no time in pressing his advantage. One night with the woman who makes him feel alive again isn&#39;t enough, but gaining Beth&#39;s trust is going to take more than seduction...&lt;/p&gt;" />
