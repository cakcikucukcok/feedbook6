  <title>My Son, My Distraction - Victoria Blackstone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;:DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Every wife, at some time in her marriage, struggles with the possibility of her husband straying. For me, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t some irrational fear; it was an almost tangible thing. I&amp;rsquo;d met her. I knew what she looked like. I knew, with absolute certainty, that if he hadn&amp;rsquo;t been intimate with her, it was only a matter of time. I found comfort in the arms of the one man I was never supposed to turn to. I was hooked, though, the moment my son slid into me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;:EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I stood and, with a finger beneath his chin, directed his lips to mine for a brief but warm kiss. &amp;ldquo;Think your momma&amp;rsquo;s pretty, huh?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He nodded, his gaze on my lips. My smile faded as I leaned back in for another, longer kiss, and when it broke, I straightened and pulled him to my chest. I pressed my lips to the top of his head, and for almost a full minute, we stayed just like that, but I laughed soundlessly when he moved against me, nuzzling me. &amp;ldquo;Aren&amp;rsquo;t you a little old to be looking for milk?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rather than answer, he moved his cheek against my hardening nipple. I exhaled, long and slow. &amp;ldquo;Gonna make &amp;lsquo;em hard again,&amp;rdquo; I murmured.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My words only spurred him on, though, and I moaned softly when I felt his hand close around my breast. &amp;ldquo;No, baby,&amp;rdquo; whispered, moving my cheek against his hair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My breath caught, my knees threatening to give out, when he bit down on my nipple, gently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Robert&amp;rsquo;s footsteps in the hall shattered the moment, and as I pulled away I waved a finger at Bobby, making him smile." />
