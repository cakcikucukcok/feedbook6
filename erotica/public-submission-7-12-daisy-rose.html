      <meta name="description" content="More men, more love, more humiliation.&lt;br /&gt;

Public Submission 7: Student&lt;br /&gt;

There&amp;#39;s only one problem. Professor Andres Keon isn&amp;#39;t one to bend his rules so easily...&amp;nbsp; The domineering older man thinks everything needs to be earned. But after he lays eyes on her, he decides to give her a chance... if she is willing to submit.&lt;br /&gt;
Just how far is she willing to go to ace a class? Will she let him and his friends have his way with her?&lt;br /&gt;
Just one peek.&lt;br /&gt;
Public Submission 9: Tied Up&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Your husband owes us a lot of money, Mrs. Joy... Now, you could continue working eighteen hour days for the rest of your life, or you could come with me and settle the debt another way... Who knows, this might actually be fun for you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
What other way?&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Why don&amp;#39;t you come and find out?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
I would much rather not.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m willing to bet you will be changing your mind real soon, Mrs. Joy... real soon...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Public Submission 11: Bosses &amp;amp; Punishments&lt;br /&gt;
Gerald Davis is a successful billionaire who, for all intents and purposes, runs a successful, multi-million-dollar business. The alpha male is rich, powerful, and sexy beyond reason.&lt;br /&gt;
At least that&amp;#39;s what the public knows. What most people don&amp;#39;t know, is that he is absolutely insane.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You know the rules, intern.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
I stare at him and begin to question all my life choices that brought me to his office. Then, drawing in a deep, shuddering breath, I turn to him and say something no one had said to him for a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
These six steamy standalone short stories feature unapologetic alpha Doms showing young submissives their rightful place.&lt;br /&gt;

Excerpt Public Submission 11: Bosses &amp;amp; Punishments:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You know the rules, intern.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
I jumped when I heard Gerald&amp;#39;s voice, a low growl that shuddered through me like a cold breeze.&lt;br /&gt;
The office had been completely empty for the past hour and he was the first to arrive. I stared at him and questioned all my life choices that brought me to this office. Then, drawing in a deep, shuddering breath, I turned to him and said something no one had said to him for a long, long time.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
I stood up, challenging him with my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
His raised his eyebrows. &amp;quot;No?&amp;quot; he echoed, his voice a deep growl that frightened me.&lt;br /&gt;
I gulped. &amp;quot;If you want me to surrender to you, you&amp;#39;re going to have to work for it,&amp;quot; I challenged.&lt;br /&gt;
The corner of his lips curved into a grin. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m going to enjoy this.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
I cursed myself for answering. What in the world was I thinking?!&lt;br /&gt;
I stopped myself from shuddering when he walked towards me and rested his hands on my shoulders, pulling the jacket that I had donned when I realized I was alone.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You smell of desire and rose petals,&amp;quot; he murmured, his voice tickling my skin even from afar. I wondered if he knew the effect he was having on me.&lt;br /&gt;
He stood in front of me and inhaled deeply, closing his eyes as if to memorize my scent completely. His hand reached behind me and he gripped my hair, pulling back to arch my neck towards him.&lt;br /&gt;
Then, he pressed his nose to the curve of my neck and breathed in, his stubble brushing against my skin delicately. His exhale warmed my sensitive skin and I shuddered as he continued to speak against it, &amp;quot;I can feel your body reacting to my touch. Are you wet for me already, intern?&amp;quot; he licked the pulsating hollow of my neck, sending a ripple of pleasure through my skin.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; I breathed the lie like a caress.&lt;br /&gt;
With his other hand, he unzipped the back of my dress, slowly moving downwards until he reached the end of the zipper. The dress fell onto the floor unceremoniously.&lt;br /&gt;
I closed my eyes, fighting back the pleasure the bubbled from deep inside me. I couldn&amp;#39;t stop the gasp from escaping when he held me tighter.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Liar,&amp;quot; he growled." />
