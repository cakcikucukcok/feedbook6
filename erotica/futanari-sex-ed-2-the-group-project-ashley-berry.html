  <title>Futanari Sex Ed 2 - The Group Project - Ashley Berry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everything was going great for Leslie at White Reef High, the all-girls school where half the students have an extra something dangling between their legs. But then a new futanari student named Amber shows up to derail Leslie&amp;#39;s budding relationship with the dynamite futanari Zara. How can Leslie choose between two strong-willed futanari? Is there a way she can please them both at the same time?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s juice in the fridge, alright girls? And if you get hungry, I&amp;#39;ve left some money on the counter for pizza.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Thanks, Mom!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leslie&amp;#39;s mother swung her handbag around her shoulder. A look of concern flittered across her face. &amp;quot;Are you sure you&amp;#39;re going to be okay here, Leslie dear? I may not be back til after midnight; these conferences usually end much later than they say.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll be fine, Mom, trust me! The assignment is due tomorrow, so we&amp;#39;ve got lots of work to do.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah, Mrs. Hall. We&amp;#39;re going to be working hard all afternoon. Don&amp;#39;t be surprised if you come home to find Leslie passed out from exhaustion.&amp;quot; She smirked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay, if you&amp;#39;re sure.&amp;quot; Her mother gave her an uncertain smile. &amp;quot;If you need anything, and I mean anything, give me a call, okay? I&amp;#39;m only half an hour away.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll be fine! I&amp;#39;m not dragging you all the way back here unless we burn the house drinking juice.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Thanks again for letting us stay here, Mrs. Hall,&amp;quot; Amber said cheerfully.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh, you&amp;#39;re welcome dear. I&amp;#39;m just glad Leslie has made such nice friends at White Reef. Now, I can leave some extra money if you need a cab to get you home.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Amber shook her head. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m parked just down the road.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay.&amp;quot; Leslie&amp;#39;s Mom nodded, as if thinking of something, anything else she needed to cover before she went.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was driving the teenager crazy. &amp;quot;Okay, have fun at the conference, Mom! Bye!&amp;quot; She was practically shoving her out the door at this point.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Bye, girls!&amp;quot; Mrs. Hall said as she left, the door closing behind her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leslie leaned against the wooden door and took one long, deep sigh. Then she looked at her classmates and a smile broke out on everyone&amp;#39;s faces.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Your room?&amp;quot; Zara asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She nodded. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll show you.&amp;quot;" />
