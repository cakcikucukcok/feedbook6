  <title>Flames of Desire - Pornelope</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Father Matthew has taken sacred vows to the Church, and they don&amp;#39;t include falling in love with--or making love to--pretty Marlie, the sexy teen who&amp;#39;s had a crush on him for years. But when disaster strikes and they&amp;#39;re stranded together on a camping trip, sparks explode and the flames of desire burn too hot for them to resist!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry.&amp;quot; When she finally spoke again, Marlie&amp;#39;s voice was strangled with remorse. &amp;quot;This is all my fault, and... I&amp;#39;m so sorry!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Father Matthew glanced up in surprise, and was appalled to see hot tears brimming in her pretty blue eyes. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t blame you, Marlie! If I hadn&amp;#39;t been in such a hurry...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But I was too close, and I fell and knocked you down! If I hadn&amp;#39;t...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I wasn&amp;#39;t watching my footing.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I still...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Marlie.&amp;quot; He cut her off by reaching over and curling both hands around her pale cheeks. Her skin felt as soft and fine as a baby&amp;#39;s. &amp;quot;This is not your fault. I wasn&amp;#39;t paying attention, and I knew better.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Whenever God throws a hurdle in my path,&amp;quot; he continued earnestly, &amp;quot;I consider it a test. I&amp;#39;m very good at passing tests; I got the highest grades in my class all through high school and then in seminary. I will not fail this one...and I won&amp;#39;t allow you to fail it, either.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But I...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No, Marlie.&amp;quot; Firmly he shook his head. &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re both going to come out of this safely, and stronger for the experience.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She wanted to believe him! &amp;quot;My knee&amp;#39;s feeling better.&amp;quot; Her voice quivered as she told the lie...then she gasped in pain when he casually dropped one hand and rested it on her aching leg. &amp;quot;Well, maybe a little.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was so transparent, but trying so hard to be brave, that he nearly smiled. &amp;quot;We have enough food between us to last several weeks,&amp;quot; he assured her, &amp;quot;and plenty of fresh mountain water. The batteries in my flashlight are new, so they should last over a week if I keep the beam on low. And I have a whole pack of extra batteries in my backpack, because you just never know what you&amp;#39;ll encounter in the mountains.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;So we won&amp;rsquo;t starve, we won&amp;rsquo;t die of thirst, and we won&amp;rsquo;t be lost in the darkness.&amp;rdquo; She managed a wobbly smile, and wished that she could feel as confident as he sounded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s right.&amp;rdquo; He gently squeezed her cold hand. &amp;ldquo;And once your sleeping bag dries out, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to sleep more comfortably, too.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I liked it better sleeping with you.&amp;rdquo; Again she spoke without thinking, then blushed beet-red. &amp;ldquo;I mean, I&amp;hellip;&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Father Matthew fought to ignore the surge of heat that rocketed through his lean frame as he remembered holding her soft, warm body all night long. &amp;ldquo;I know what you meant. I&amp;rsquo;m afraid we&amp;rsquo;ll have to keep doing it for a while longer. It&amp;rsquo;s so humid down here that your bag may take a long time to dry out.&amp;rdquo; Pensively he slid one long finger down a glistening rock, and wondered whether his wavering resolve would survive that long." />
