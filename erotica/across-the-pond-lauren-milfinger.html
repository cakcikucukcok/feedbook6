  <title>Across The Pond - Lauren Milfinger</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A trip to England to visit her uncle and his family during college summer break provided Lauren with a new outlook on family relations. Her fraternal twin cousins, Eve and Andrew, were eager to show her some things in the old carriage house. Her aunt and uncle both wanted to give her a personal welcome. It was going to be an intimate, and very stimulating, experience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Did you three have a good day today?&amp;rdquo; Aunt Imogen asked, after we&amp;rsquo;d eaten and were sipping at our wine glasses. That was a new experience for me, being able to drink legally. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be able to do that for another two years at home.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;You have a lovely place here.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Eve nodded, smiling. &amp;ldquo;Oh, yes, Mum, it was grand. Lauren is a wonderful quim gobbler.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was very glad I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a mouthful of wine at that moment, because it would have been all over the table if I had.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aunt Imogen looked at me thoughtfully. &amp;ldquo;Are you really, dear? I do hope you&amp;rsquo;ll demonstrate that talent for me before you go home. Eve is wonderfully talented herself, but one always hopes a new partner will introduce some previously unknown nuance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;How&amp;rsquo;d you do with them, son?&amp;rdquo; Uncle Ralph asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Fine. Eve let me bugger her, as usual, and then the both of them sucked me and Lauren took my whole load and swallowed all of it. Bit of all right, that was.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I said something at that point. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what. It probably wasn&amp;rsquo;t coherent. The whole situation was just weird. I was worried about how to keep this from Uncle Ralph and Aunt Imogen, and here were the twins telling them everything, as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Not like Georgia, is it, Lauren?&amp;rdquo; Uncle Ralph commented.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;They&amp;rsquo;re just, uh, kidding you, you know?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aunt Imogen&amp;rsquo;s laugh went a long way toward taking the edge off the situation. &amp;ldquo;Oh, don&amp;rsquo;t be silly, dear,&amp;rdquo; she said, still chuckling. &amp;ldquo;We have a very open household when it comes to sex.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes,&amp;rdquo; Uncle Ralph said. &amp;ldquo;We had to be a little circumspect when these two were younger, but once they turned eighteen, well, we just let them know that whatever they wanted to do would be just fine with us.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;We already had our suspicions, but they assured us they waited until the day after their eighteenth birthday before they actually did anything.&amp;rdquo;" />
