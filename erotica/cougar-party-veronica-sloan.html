  <title>Cougar Party - Veronica Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION&lt;br /&gt;
Stacy&amp;#39;s quarterback son is an undeniable alpha male, but when his fraternity throws a kinky &amp;quot;Cougar Party,&amp;quot; his usual girlfriends won&amp;#39;t do. Looking to inject a little fun in her busy life, Stacy suggests they go as a fake couple. She&amp;#39;s been so lonely, and Jason makes her feel so alive. She knows it&amp;#39;s naughty, but after a night of fun and drinking, all Stacy wants is for Jason to take her upstairs!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT&lt;br /&gt;
He slid his fingers through my hair and gently tilted my head back. Warm lips caressed mine, and for an instant the sensation was so wonderfully alien I couldn&amp;#39;t remember how to kiss. I hadn&amp;#39;t been kissed like that in ages. Truthfully, I&amp;#39;d never been kissed like that. My hand hooked around Jason&amp;#39;s waist. My other hand dropped my drink. Encouraged, Jason crushed me to his body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he released me, the group was nowhere to be found. But our hour was clearly up. The rest of the hotel surrounded us on the dance floor. &amp;quot;Sorry,&amp;quot; said Jason quickly. He rubbed a thumb gently against his lip. &amp;quot;I just-&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I threw my arms over Jason&amp;#39;s neck and kissed him more fiercely. He gave a pleasant if startled grunt and quickly crossed his arms over my bare back. My breasts pushed into his rock hard chest and my heels left the dance floor. We kissed longer this time, and I didn&amp;#39;t object when his tongue came out to play. I tasted like gin, he tasted like beer, and we drank each other in. I simply couldn&amp;#39;t stop.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We pressed our heads together when we had to take a breath. &amp;quot;That was a hungry kiss,&amp;quot; my son whispered to me. &amp;quot;I think you want something.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I just want to enjoy this,&amp;quot; I said. Did I dare to meet his eyes? Would he judge me? The hand he slid over my ass was my answer. &amp;quot;I feel so good,&amp;quot; I murmured.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes you do,&amp;quot; he agreed. &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s that?&amp;quot; he asked, eyeing the card. As if he didn&amp;#39;t know.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Ana said we could use their room,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;If we get tired, I think.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Are you tired?&amp;quot; His eyes searched mine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I think I would like to lie down,&amp;quot; I said. My lips still thrummed from his kiss. &amp;quot;Do you think they&amp;#39;ll mind? If we leave for a little bit?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He smiled at what remained of our party in the corner. &amp;quot;I think everyone&amp;#39;s exactly where they want to be,&amp;quot; he said. Becky was sitting in Bradley&amp;#39;s lap and he was eating her with his eyes. She giggled madly, her drink spilling over its brim. Chuck and Giselle looked like they were fighting, but maybe it was a form of foreplay. The others, the ones that I could see, were all dancing or chatting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jason&amp;#39;s fingers slipped through mine. &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s go.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Just for a little bit,&amp;quot; I reminded him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Just a little bit,&amp;quot; he agreed." />
