  <title>Bad Ink Prequel: Book VI - Michelle White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="For those that need a little help getting through the rest of the day, &quot;Bad Ink Prequel&quot; is part of what the Author calls her &quot;Lunch Break SFF Series, &quot; the &quot;SFF&quot; stands for &quot;Sexual Fantasy Fix.&quot; These books are short and hot, just the right length to read over a lunch break, and you&#39;re guaranteed to start the 2nd half of the day with a new bounce in your step. Some books will be part of a series, and some will be stand alone, but all come with a WARNING... Ladies, always have a dry pair of panties to change into, or the rest of the day could be a little uncomfortable. Gentlemen, well on 2nd thought, I guess you know how to relieve yourselves if the need comes up, so just carry on! This is how Bad Ink started... Twenty-nine-year old Sean has life by the balls: great middle management suite and tie position, the looks that make women easy to approach, and the confidence to pull it off. Sean knows exactly what he likes in a woman, and he&#39;s not settling for anything less just to get laid." />
