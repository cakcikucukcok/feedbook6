      <meta name="description" content="Fired and homeless, 18-year-old Bonnie and her Doberman, Ninja, found shelter in an abandoned warehouse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Only to realize that it was territory controlled by Butch the German Shepherd.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And Butch wanted payment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She was suddenly startled from her thoughts by a deep growl that sounded like thunder. She looked up to see a large, menacing German Shepherd.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ninja and the German Shepherd greeted one another. Bonnie watched, wondering if the Shepherd was a friend or foe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;This is Butch. He says we can stay, but he wants payment.&amp;quot; Ninja said, with his dark brown eyes sparkling.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Payment? Would does that mean?&amp;quot; She asked, furrowing her brows.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He whispered something in her ear and her eyes snapped open in shock.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re crazy!&amp;quot; She exclaimed, but feeling excited and stunned at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Nope. That&amp;#39;s all you have to do.&amp;quot; Ninja sat down and scratched behind his ear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m a virgin. I don&amp;#39;t know anything about having sex.&amp;quot; She gasped, wondering what she was going to do.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s the best kind.&amp;quot; Ninja grinned excitedly and looked at the German Shepherd.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bonnie had always wondered what sex was like. Her parents had always sheltered her from that aspect of life, even when she asked questions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;#39;ll understand once you&amp;#39;re married. They&amp;#39;d told her in a cryptic manner and so she took them at their word.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now that I&amp;#39;m an adult, I can find out. Bonnie smiled at the thought.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Sure, you boys are going to have to teach me. Agreed?&amp;quot; She told them and was pleased that they nodded their head as eagerness filled their eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What do I do?&amp;quot; she wanted to know." />
