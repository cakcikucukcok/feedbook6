  <title>The Commodities Market - Patrick Richards</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Adam Jensen had it all - money, a beautiful wife and the uncanny ability to launder money for a very wealthy and extremely evil man.  But when he dealt with Rafael Rodriguez, he was dealing with Satin himself.  And as they say, &quot;If you dance with the devil you&#39;re going to get burned.&quot; He gets far more than that.  Adam mysteriously disappears while on a Caribbean cruise and finds himself deep in the jungles of Central America.  He is brutally tortured and physically conditioned by a sadistic Mistress and her two ruthless helpers.  But that is just a prelude to what comes next. After months of hard labor and pain he is sold at an auction in Rio de Janeiro to Frau Strobel, where he is to be kept in her dungeon to suffer in constant agony and absolute misery every day for the rest of his life.  Eva Strobel and her two heartless female assistants use diabolical tortures, fiendish games and even crueler punishments as well as daily agonizing bondage to satisfy their sadistic cravings and serve revenge to their cartel friend. During this horrendous life sentence he meets Tomás, another young man who crossed Rafael Rodriguez.  The tortures that they each endure are far beyond anyone&#39;s comprehension. Strictly by accident the lives of these two men change drastically one day but who knows what will happen tomorrow." />
