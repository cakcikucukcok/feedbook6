  <title>Anything He Wants - Sara Fawkes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;First published as a five-part e serial novel, Anything He Wants inflamed imaginations everywhere and became a national bestseller.  Now available for the first time ever as a complete book, this edition contains never-before-released scenes and special bonus material. Don&#39;t miss Sara Fawkes&#39; erotic tale of  a powerful billionaire who &lt;u&gt;always&lt;/u&gt; gets what he wants and the young woman who&#39;s about to enter his exclusive realm--a world of glittering opulence and all-consuming passion, where she&#39;ll explore the darkest reaches of her own desire.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lucy Delacourt&#39;s temp position isn&#39;t quite her dream job but it pays the bills. The highlight of her day is riding the elevator in the mornings with a handsome stranger. Tall, dark, and sexy as hell, Lucy knows he&#39;s way out of her league, but a girl can look, right?&lt;br&gt;Everything changes the day the stranger seduces her. Completely out of character, she yields without a fight, but she has no idea her wanton acts with a man whose name she doesn&#39;t know will change her life forever. Because the sexy stranger is none other than Jeremiah Hamilton, billionaire CEO of Hamilton Industries, and one taste isn&#39;t nearly enough to satisfy his need.  As the billionaire pulls Lucy deeper into his world of high stakes business deals and ruthless takeovers, he demands nothing less than her complete surrender.  But even as enemies seek deadly revenge against him, she&#39;ll discover that her greatest threat is falling for her fiercely guarded boss...and yielding to her own darkest needs.&lt;/p&gt;" />
