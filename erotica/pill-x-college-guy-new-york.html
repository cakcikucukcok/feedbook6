  <title>Pill X: College - Guy New York</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;When a big drug company released Pill X, curing the world of every disease known to man, what they didn’t say was it also heightens libido and lowers inhibitions. The day the pill was launched went down in history as Pill Day, and sexual pandemonium swept the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pill X: College, follows two roommates as they got lost in the debauchery sweeping their campus. From frat house orgies to a first time experience between two college boys, this book is filthy, unprotected, hilarious, and incredibly sexy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s both gayer and more over the top than the first book with plenty of guy and guy and guy on girl action as well. If you’ve ever fantasized about what it would be like to live without the risk of disease, especially on a rambunctious college campus, then this is the book for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just like in the original Pill X, each of the stories connect through characters, leading to one gloriously day of filthy and taboo debauchery.&lt;/p&gt;
