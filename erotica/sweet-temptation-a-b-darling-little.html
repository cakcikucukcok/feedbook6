  <title>Sweet Temptation - A.B. Darling Little</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Everything is falling apart in Sally&amp;#39;s life. She loses her family, then her job, her home, and then, she loses everything she owns. So, nobody can blame her for being careless and trusting her doctor to know what&amp;#39;s best when he gives her a bunch of forms to sign.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly, she finds herself in the grasp of a Werewolf Alpha and a Vampire King, both intent on claiming her as their Little.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Just one last thing,&amp;quot; Doctor Shaw says.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The micro-chipping?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m afraid so. It might pinch a little more and she&amp;#39;s grumpy already, so be prepared for a tantrum.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She huffs. She&amp;#39;s not going to throw a tantrum. But what did he mean with a micro-chip? Was it the tracking chip he had mentioned earlier? She&amp;#39;s not some sort of animal. She doesn&amp;#39;t need to be tracked!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Perhaps it&amp;#39;s best to put her in a diaper first,&amp;quot; Doctor Shaw recommends. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve had a few patients...&amp;quot; he trails off and makes some sort of gesture with his hands that she doesn&amp;#39;t understand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll do it,&amp;quot; Mr. Blair says immediately. &amp;quot;Shh... It&amp;#39;s alright, darling. Daddy&amp;#39;s just going to change you into something comfortable,&amp;quot; he says, pinning her wrists over her head and bending down to lick up her cheek with the flat of his tongue. The action startles her into stillness that he takes full advantage of, capturing her ankle and tugging her shoes off, and then her sock. &amp;quot;Daddy&amp;#39;s gonna change you into something comfy, okay, Baby?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;#39;s not her Daddy. She doesn&amp;#39;t even know who he is!&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll have to bring her in for a full-body check-up before you do anything else with her,&amp;quot; Doctor Shaw says. &amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s rather small and you are a big man, Erik.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Erik? Is that his name? Erik Blair? The name sounds so familiar, but she can&amp;#39;t figure out why that is because she is reeling from humiliation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Blair frowns. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not going to knot her until she&amp;#39;s ready.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wait. What?" />
