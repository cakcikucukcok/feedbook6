&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Ted was gone and Pain stood there. Morgan poked her head out looking both ways for him. He was nowhere in sight. Fucker.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Morgan brought her attention back to Pain. He stood there mouth open. That pissed her off more. &amp;ldquo;Never seen a woman before?&amp;rdquo; Pain looked her up and down. He&amp;rsquo;s eyes appeared to get wider as they rose up her body. They stopped predictably at her chest. Morgan clicked her fingers at him. &amp;ldquo;Up here buddy.&amp;rdquo; She told him pointing to her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pain couldn&amp;rsquo;t believe what he was seeing. Morgan dressed to kill, and he was sure, he&amp;rsquo;d stopped breathing, as he gazed at her in all her glory. Then she&amp;rsquo;d snapped at him and his cock had twitched in delight. He&amp;rsquo;d heard her comment on his gaze not going passed her chest. But dam, it was a fine chest. And so much of it was on show. Morgan had squeezed into a body fitting dress that stopped at her thigh.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was short and deep red. It set off the halo of her hair perfectly and showed her hourglass figure, long legs and firm filled breasts, that were practically spilling out. Begging him, to come out and play. His mouth watered. Her nipples demanding his attention.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Hay,&amp;rdquo; Morgan shouted, &amp;ldquo;if those eyes do not get off my tits this date is over.&amp;rdquo; She crossed her chest with her arms and that just made it worse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pain grinned and lifted his gaze. &amp;ldquo;Your fucking beautiful Morgan and I want to fuck you into next week.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Morgan&amp;rsquo;s body fired. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t hungry for food and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do the date thing, but suddenly she needed cock. It had been a while. She grabbed his T and pulled him into her room. The door closed behind them. &amp;ldquo;Ok, let&amp;rsquo;s see what you&amp;rsquo;ve got soldier.&amp;rdquo; She demanded as she kicked off her shoes, grabbed the hem of her dress and drew it up and off her body, throwing it on the chair in one movement. She stood in her bra and panties facing him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pain stood stunned. He&amp;rsquo;d expected to have to wine and dine Morgan and wear her down but no, there she stood in all that glory and demanded what she wanted. She was a goddess. His emotions told him. Pain pulled off his T and bent to untie his boots. Kicking them off with his socks, he unbuttoned his jeans. Morgan&amp;rsquo;s eyes followed every movement. The bulge of his cock clearly evident, the tip now peaked out the top of his open jeans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;You sure about this Morgan? I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to stop.&amp;rdquo; He&amp;rsquo;d give her an out even now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Morgan shook her head. &amp;ldquo;O I&amp;rsquo;m sure we both want this. Show me.&amp;rdquo; Pain undid the buttons on his jeans one by one. As each button slipped open, his cock pulsed and became more visible. Morgan licked her lips. On the third button it sprang free. Morgan&amp;rsquo;s eyes got very round. Pain watched the emotions crossing her face. She licked her lips again, leaned forward and grabbed both sides of his jean waist, and yanked them down. His cock sprang free. Morgan&amp;rsquo;s eyes lit up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Before he could say anything, Morgan bent forward and sucked him into her mouth, grabbing his ass with both her hands.&lt;br /&gt;
