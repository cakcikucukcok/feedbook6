He&#39;s gotten over the betrayal he felt when he found her and his best friend together on the eve of his wedding, but it&#39;s obvious he&#39;s never given up wanting her. And now that she&#39;s back he&#39;ll show her what she&#39;s missed, how good he makes her feel, how easy it is for him to take control and bring her to the edge of sweet surrender.  .  . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;This book has something for everyone: hot sex scenes, a sexy hero with a tragic past, a smart and compassionate heroine, intrigue, danger and Regency London at its most decadent!&quot; &amp;#8212;&lt;i&gt;Romantic Times&lt;/i&gt; on &lt;i&gt;Simply Sexual&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Can you say HOT? Well it doesn&#39;t get much hotter than Simply Sexual. From the first scorching page to the last, Kate Pearce takes you on a wild ride of sex and suspense, keeping you guessing until the very end.&quot;  &amp;#8212;&lt;i&gt;Simply Romance Reviews&lt;/i&gt;" />
