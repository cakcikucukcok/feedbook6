  <title>Vengeance - Ronald A. Moore</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The book is mainly a crime story with a heartwarming love theme built in to the context. The crime is the illegal sale and distribution of drugs through the equine sports of horse racing and show jumping and how the sports became infiltrated by shady owners and people working within the two sportsfor instance, race horse trainers and jockeys. The novel takes you on a journey at breakneck speed on how the drugs come into the country and are then dispersed through a network of outlets on the racecourses all over the south of England. Furthermore, the novel tackles how the drugs are passed to customers in such a unique manner without money actually changing hands. 
The novel tells the story of the jockey clubs security agents, Discreet Intelligence Reports &amp; Technical Services (DIRTS), an independent company that deals with all the jockey club security problems, with the jockey club running horse racing in Great Britain. Steve Hurst is the main character in the novel, and DIRTS is his company. The two sports are being swamped with the illegal sale and distribution of cocaine and heroin. Steve loses his fiance, Jane Coe, an international show jumper, to the influences of drugs as she falls for a fellow show jumping junky, Chris Cobb. Steve falls into the arms of one of his employees, Laura, and the love story quickly gathers pace. But who wants to kill Laura and Steve, what do they know, and can Chief Inspector Heyes of the Sussex Police Constabulary save them in time before the contract killer strikes?
Initial Review of Vengeance; Readers Digest Magazine.
VENGEANCE which is supurbly crafted, intricately detailed story is by turns joyful, sorrowful, and uplifting. A must-read story of relationships, prejudice, and a vivad paean for justice.
Overall this fine book offers well-drawn, human characters and logically flowing action.. all written in a striking style
If you enjoyed Vengeance, the sequel, The Secret Syndicate, is under way! Its set in Sussex and filled with more intrigue regarding the horse-racing industry. (Release date: September 2015.) Find out how Steve and Laura, Ricky and Charlie, and DCI John Heyes crack their second case. Will Miles and Natalie get together? And how will Laura deal with a yard full of horses?
Ronald Moore had the incredible experience of working as an assistant trainer in a racing yard during the late 1980s and early 1990s. He has also held a jockeys licence during that time and rode in races. His niece was an international showjumper who represented her country many times before turning to race riding; she rode in two Grand Nationals. Ronald has always been interested in horse racing and showjumping, and has owned many racehorses and showjumpers over the years.
One of his favourite authors is Dick Francis, who wrote many novels based on the horse-racing theme. Jilly Cooper, famed for her book Riders, set in the promiscuous showjumping world, is another author he admires.
Vengeance is Ronalds first novel, and he sought to blend racing and showjumping as the storys backdrop, peppering the action with romance, as well as various criminal activities regarding the illegal sale and distribution of drugs. This provides a unique spin on this tried-and-trusted equestrian theme that has served countless authors so well in the past. Ronald intends to utilise the main characters in this novel in the sequel which he is writing at the moment. He hopes the poignant scenes and moral issues threaded through the story, together with the romance and fast-paced action, will make Vengeance a memorable and enjoyable read." />
