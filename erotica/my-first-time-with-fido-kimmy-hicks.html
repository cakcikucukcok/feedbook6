  <title>My First Time with Fido - Kimmy Hicks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The sexual tension that had been growing between my male Rottweiler, Joey, and I was hard to ignore. His advances were getting more and more persistent, but I just wasn&#39;t sure that I could let my dog lick me...down there. The more interested he became in my pussy, the more I considered letting him have it- until one night in bed, when bad weather had us cuddled together for a cozy night in. That night, I finally gave in, opening my legs to my frisky dog and letting him pleasure me with his tongue, and more - and not regretting one moment of the ecstasy that was to follow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the pleasurable shudder had subsided, I felt different. Enchanted, as if a blockage had been removed. I felt sexually free, and safe to explore whatever I thought would feel good, without inhibition or worry. I wanted more. My pussy was soaked, and I wasn&#39;t done. Sexual need coursed through every vein in my body and I knew that I wanted to be properly fucked, right then and there. I also knew that Joey&#39;s was the cock that I wanted, the one that I trusted to bring me to cloud nine and keep me there. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if in a dream, I sat up next to Joey on the bed, and rubbed low on his ribs so that he would roll over for a belly scratching. When he rolled to his side, to my delight, I found his penis was fully unsheathed and erect. I had never touched a dog&#39;s cock before, and I hoped that he would like it. I rubbed his stomach with one hand, and reached out to take his cock in my other hand. It was smooth and warm to the touch. I stroked his hard cock up and down a few times, and he let his back legs fall apart, enjoying the attention." />
