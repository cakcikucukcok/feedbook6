  <title>Daddy’s Forbidden Desire (Complete Collection) - Veronica Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION
Volumes 1-4 of &quot;Daddy&#39;s Forbidden Desire&quot; is now available in one box set! Dale is a hard-working husband and father with a lot on his mind, but he&#39;s still got the libido of a young stallion! His wife is no longer interested in sex, so what can he do when his hot and horny daughter sets out to seduce him? As Katie tempts her father at every turn, will Dale give in to this forbidden desire?
EXCERPT
&quot;Dad, do you know Vanessa Linares?&quot;
He didn&#39;t have to think about it. Dale knew Vanessa Linares very well. He had fucked her eight ways to Sunday off and on throughout college. He thought he was in love with her at one time. Then she got married to her boyfriend who—apparently—she&#39;d been dating since high school. He wasn&#39;t invited to the wedding.
&quot;She&#39;s my Social Policy professor.&quot;
If Dale had been drinking the water he would have spat it out in classic cinematic fashion.
Katie went on, &quot;We&#39;re really close. Sometimes we go for drinks at the bar on campus and she asked me about my last name.&quot; Katie grinned like a cheshire cat. &quot;She remembers you very fondly.&quot;
Dale was pleased. &quot;You don&#39;t say.&quot;
&quot;Yeah.&quot; Katie drifted off again. Her eyes kept flicking from his face to his chest as if he wasn&#39;t watching her watch him. &quot;She said all it took to get you to drop everything was a wet, sloppy blowjob.&quot;
Dale didn&#39;t know what to say. He stared at his daughter. Katie had her arms crossed over her chest, the glass pressed against her upper arm. She broke the silence. &quot;I was kind of thinking about it.&quot;
What did she mean?
&quot;Dad, do you and mom have sex?&quot;
&quot;Katie, I don&#39;t know what—&quot;
&quot;Come ON, Dad.&quot; She strode to him and let him catch her as she draped her arms over him. She was sleepy, staring up at him. &quot;Don&#39;t pretend I&#39;m too young to hear the truth.&quot;
&quot;Well,&quot; he said. How did one proceed in this conversation? &quot;Well,&quot; he said again. And finally, &quot;No, Katie, your mother and I don&#39;t really have sex that much anymore.&quot;
Katie stared up at him with something akin to sympathy and something very much like loneliness. &quot;Vanessa said you kind of had a reputation at college.&quot;
Dale&#39;s head swam. He became intensely aware of his daughter&#39;s breasts pressed against his chest. She continued, &quot;And I was thinking about that. I kind of couldn&#39;t stop because, um, you&#39;re my dad? But, I was thinking how I never thought of you that way. Mostly because,&quot; she looked at him intensely, &quot;I don&#39;t think I ever heard you having sex. With mom.&quot;
&quot;Katie, I don&#39;t think this is appropriate.&quot;
&quot;OK,&quot; she said. &quot;So you and mom don&#39;t have sex?&quot;
&quot;Katie—&quot;
&quot;But you used to have a lot of sex back in the day.&quot;
&quot;It wasn&#39;t &#39;back in the day&#39;—&quot;
&quot;And now you just don&#39;t have sex at all?&quot;
&quot;Katie—&quot;
&quot;That sounds like it really sucks, Dad.&quot;
He stared down at his daughter. Her eyes flitted over his, over his cheeks, over his nose, his ears. Her face was flushed. Suddenly he felt her heart ramming against her breasts and beating on his ribcage; he felt his own heart pounding.
&quot;I love you,&quot; she said to him.
&quot;I love you, too, honey.&quot;
&quot;Uh huh,&quot; she breathed up at him. &quot;I&#39;m sorry you don&#39;t have sex anymore.&quot;
&quot;Oh, Katie—&quot;
&quot;I said it sucks. Does it suck?&quot; She pronounced the word in a very deliberate way. He started to say something but she reached down and grabbed him in a place—the exact place—that was eternally off-limits. &quot;Does it suck, Daddy?&quot;" />
