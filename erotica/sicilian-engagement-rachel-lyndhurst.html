  <title>Sicilian Engagement - Rachel Lyndhurst</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sicilian Engagement Series, Book One&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Billionaire Lorenzo Ferrante has tried marriage before and knows it for the trap it is. However, like it or not, he needs a fiancée now in order to close a deal that will set him free from his family&#39;s sordid past. All the Sicilian wants is to start fresh somewhere and build a good life for himself and his two little girls. A wife would also be able to help him care for and guide his twin daughters. It&#39;s as simple as that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks to her lowlife brother, Lora Pryce-Howard is being blackmailed into playing Lorenzo Ferrante&#39;s fiancée. She&#39;ll have to play along if she wants to keep her business, a roof over her ailing mother&#39;s head, and her brother alive. She refuses to be seduced by a luxurious Mediterranean lifestyle, but it&#39;s Lorenzo&#39;s soft words and burning kisses that make it impossible to leave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Money can buy the billionaire a fiancée, but it may cost more than he&#39;s willing to give to gain her heart.&lt;/p&gt;" />
