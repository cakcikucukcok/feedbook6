  <title>The Package - Juleigh Patrick</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Holly Lane Couture is a successful author who is hard at work on her fourth novel. When she is overcome with a challenging case of writers block, she decides to move from Chicago to Anchorage, Alaska, where she hopes to be inspired. As she buries herself in her work, Holly cannot help but wonder if she will ever meet Mr. Right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Billionaire entrepreneur--Tim Davenport--is gorgeous, sexy, and going through the motions with his live-in girlfriend. After she secretly drugs him and kicks him out, Tim decides to head to Alaska. When a minor fender bender in the parking lot of the luxurious apartment complex he owns leads him to Hollys door, she invites him to take refuge on her couch, without any idea that he is the most eligible bachelor in America. Their chemistry is undeniable and soon develops into a passionate relationship. After Tim finally convinces a hesitant Holly to marry him, their life together begins unfolding, providing Holly inspiration for her next book and leaving her hoping that their story will have a happy ending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Package&lt;/em&gt; shares the erotic tale of a billionaire and his new writer wife as they attempt to overcome their obstacles and build a life together.&lt;/p." />
