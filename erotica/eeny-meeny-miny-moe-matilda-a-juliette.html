  <title>Eeny, Meeny, Miny, Moe - Matilda A. Juliette</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Ever tempted to get inside your yoga teachers mind? 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
North American author and yoga teacher, Matilda, transparently invites us into her realm of reality vs rendezvous. Slim pickins is defined as a small amount left after others have taken a share and that describes dating in a mountain ski village perfectly; a small amount of men after others have taken a share. Boooo 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The more she mindfully meanders the dating scene in search of true love, the more unique her tastes have become. She amusingly depicts each alluring tale. Yes, ladies and gentlemen the guy that ends up sticking by her side will be an exceptionally rare breed of human. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Liberated by yoga, slinky Matilda excitingly views the world as an open door. Around each corner a new irresistible moment waits to be discovered. She lives in the moment and appreciates the journey. Becoming her true self kinda made her awkward as hell, kind as can be, and fabulously bitchy. ;) 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
She takes on the world with not her heart on her sleeve, but her soul. It is comforting to hear that regardless of stature or physique, strength or spirit, people struggle just the same both with others, and with ourselves.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Matilda is a sultry storyteller, and this book is a collection of beautiful short stories, a compilation of risky and seductive encounters paired with tasteful karma. Perception should never be interpreted as truth, but simply flirtatious fiction.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Come-hither." />
