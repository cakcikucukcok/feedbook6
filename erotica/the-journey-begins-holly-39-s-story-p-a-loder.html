  <title>The Journey Begins-Holly&#39;s Story - P. A. Loder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After a failed Dominant/submissive relationship, HOLLY STANTON is forced to move back home with her family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Determined to understand why she was unable to adapt, Holly sets out to learn everything she can about the lifestyle and in the process, she hopes to discover and correct her shortcomings. During the course of her research, she finds the concept of a true Dominant/submissive relationship fascinating and intriguing. Resolved to learn more, Holly finds herself at the door of a local BDSM club about to embark on the journey alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MASTER JASON WOODS is part-owner of Paradise Isles and instantly sees something in her he rarely sees in a newbie. His interest is piqued, and he assigns her training to a fun-loving guy who is a no-nonsense , by-the-book Dominant. MASTER MARKUS ANASTOS has trained submissives for years, but never a newbie. He firmly believes that when training a submissive, the training should be only about discipline and kinknever personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once inside the dark and steamy world of BDSM, Holly finds the deep sense of belonging she craves, and the sensuality she never knew existed.
&lt;p&gt; Unable to resist Holly&#39;s quiet beauty, Markus finds himself straying from his set-in-stone training protocols. The growing trust between the Dominant and submissive is threatened when a beautiful young woman enters Paradise Isles determined to destroy the budding relationship.&lt;/p&gt;" />
