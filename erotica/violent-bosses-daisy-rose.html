  <title>Violent Bosses - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marie is a shy, law-abiding secretary by morning and a titillating, rule-bending seductress by night. Everyone needs something. It&amp;#39;s her job to fulfill those needs, however depraved and perverse. Her life is going to be even more interesting when The Master arrives at her night job and demands her submission, and even more so when her best friend professes his love to her and demands her consent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Marie.&amp;quot; His mask tilted up and down, piercing blue eyes drinking in the sight of my body, wearing only the hospital-like paper gown that he had provided exactly for his purpose.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Master,&amp;quot; I said. Master. No names. Just Master.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Safe word.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Red,&amp;quot; I said, like every other time he asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;And if your lips are otherwise... occupied?&amp;quot; His teeth flashed at the thought, excitement crackling in the air.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not for the first time, I wondered who he was beneath the mask. I wondered what he did for a living that made him so angry. His shoulders were tensed, his fingers trembling from anticipation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A sharp tap with my fingernail,&amp;quot; I said, swallowing the lump in my throat. &amp;quot;Hard enough to leave a mark,&amp;quot; I said, suddenly breathless. I&amp;#39;d never had to use the safeword before.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Good.&amp;quot; He let go of a breath he had been holding. His hands stilled. I considered asking why he insisted on repeating this every session but I could sense that the ritual calmed him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He stood up and I took an involuntary step back, surprised by the sudden movement. His grin widened and he advanced towards me like an animal cornering prey.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt the cold wall against my back.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Remember your safe word if things get too... intense,&amp;quot; he whispered against my ear. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve been having a particularly stupid week.&amp;quot; His words vibrated through my bones. I had misjudged his calm. He was practically trembling.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, Master.&amp;quot; I found myself saying and prepared myself for the pain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was a professional. I had done these sessions before. But he was quick. He backhanded me across my face before I saw his hand move. My head turned with the blow and it stung. My ears rang from the sharp impact. The taste of metal was on my tongue when I licked my lips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Look at me,&amp;quot; he demanded. taking my chin between his thumb and forefinger to make me comply. &amp;quot;Look at me,&amp;quot; he growled, a guttural sound that rumbled up from deep in my chest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Master.&amp;quot; My lower lip trembled, but I led him guide my face to his.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His sharp gaze locked me in place. At the sight of him, heat slammed into my body, suddenly, violently, and my hands curled into fists to keep myself from pulling him closer and kissing him senseless." />
