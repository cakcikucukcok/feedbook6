  <title>Her Daughter&#39;s Boyfriend - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Tina has always tried to do the right thing, but when she catches her daughter Kelly&amp;#39;s boyfriend, Jason, staring, she likes the attention and plays it up. When Jason breaks up with Kelly, Tina realizes it was her fault and feels terrible. But when he shows up the next day her guilt is replaced with another emotion; lust. Tina is about to prove that sometimes wrong can feel pretty damned good!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s not here!&amp;quot; Tina yelled loud enough for Jason to hear her through the glass.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I just want to talk, Miss Denny, please?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You have balls showing up here, kid.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I know.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not getting in the middle of you two.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You didn&amp;#39;t mind getting in the middle yesterday.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What the hell does that mean?&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I know to you I&amp;#39;m a kid, but I&amp;#39;m not stupid. Can we just talk?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Go ahead.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Can I come in?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tina saw no reason to talk and saw the reason the answer should be no. Jason was already staring at her legs&amp;nbsp; and like yesterday, was making no effort to conceal he was checking her out&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Also like yesterday, she returned the favor. Jason was simply dressed in a snug black t-shirt and a pair of tight jeans that showed off the large bulge she&amp;#39;d taken far too much interest in yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Miss Denny?&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tina looked up to see Jason now looking at her, and with a slight smile on his face. Smug bastard had caught her looking. Tell him to leave!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay but be quick about it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tina slid the door open and stood to the side, closing it after he entered. She walked over to the counter and leaned against, gesturing at the table.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You can sit if you want.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d rather stand.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You don&amp;#39;t have to stand so close; I know to you I&amp;#39;m an old lady, but I can hear just fine.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re no old lady, Miss Denny,&amp;quot; Jason didn&amp;#39;t move. &amp;quot;And you know it.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s that supposed to mean?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Really?&amp;quot; Jason raised his eyebrows. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re going to pretend you weren&amp;#39;t putting on a show for me yesterday?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When Tina&amp;#39;s response was to look away, he nodded.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Thought so, and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure you knew I was enjoying the show.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay, it&amp;#39;s been awhile since I had that kind of attention, and I was playing it up,&amp;quot; Tina admitted. &amp;quot;What does that have to do with why you&amp;#39;re here?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m here because you had just as much fun being watched.&amp;quot; Jason grinned. &amp;quot;You really didn&amp;#39;t think I saw that lame mirror trick? I do that at the beach all the time.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tina blushed, she needed to end this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If you don&amp;#39;t tell me why you&amp;#39;re here, I&amp;#39;m going to tell you to leave.&amp;quot; Her tone made her even more angry for letting him know he&amp;#39;d gotten to her.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m here because I figure it&amp;#39;s what we both want.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Excuse me?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I was looking, you were looking, and I&amp;#39;m pretty sure we were both thinking about doing more than looking.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Kid, you&amp;#39;re out of your mind if you think I felt anything other than flattered.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That why you went in and &amp;#39;flattered&amp;#39; yourself?&amp;quot; Jason smirked. &amp;quot;Sounded like a good one.&amp;quot;" />
