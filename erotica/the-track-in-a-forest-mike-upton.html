Author Mike Uptons 12th novel is his 2nd book of ghost stories. Five separate erotic tales of ghosts and unusual occurrences all set in his home county of Norfolk. Are ghosts real? Do they exist? 
Billy: An old ghostly fisherman long dead appears to recently divorced Theo in the small sailing harbour where he keeps his own boat. But can he convince either Hannah with whom he is having a torrid affair and then Patsy of what hes seen? 
The Roman: A family move into an old cottage but soon strange happenings occur in one of the bedrooms as they uncover a past story of the missing Roman Legion.
The Track in A Forest: A young couple walking in a forest stumble on a past event which inexplicably seems to be re-enacted to them in the present day. But are they themselves all they seem?
The White Lady: Who is the mysterious beautiful lady reputed to haunt the old Barnton Manor house and will David be lucky enough to meet with her?
Millie: After discovering love and then betrayal, she finds solace with the ghost of her beloved horse Jupiter." />
