  <title>Shattered Crystal - Jasen Flint</title>
      <meta name="description" content="He married the girl of his dreams&amp;hellip;and stepped headfirst into a nightmare.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Tim and Crystal are blissfully happy together until Shane moves into their quiet little trailer park. The outlaw biker is mysterious, a little dangerous, and ruggedly handsome. Crystal is instantly captivated by his sexy body and no-holds-barred lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shane is happy to help fulfill their sexual fantasies&amp;hellip;and then introduce Crystal to the steamy world of stripping, Meth addiction, and drug trafficking.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She&amp;#39;s the perfect drug mule&amp;hellip;gorgeous, na&amp;iuml;ve, seductively innocent. No one will ever suspect her of a thing&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I met your mule today,&amp;rdquo; Jingles admitted, then raised both hands when Shane looked at him sharply. &amp;ldquo;I just said hi, buddy. That&amp;rsquo;s it.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Good. I need her&amp;hellip;for now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cautiously Jingles scanned the room, then turned back. &amp;ldquo;Look here, man. You got your mules, and you got the hook in &amp;rsquo;em. That method works, and I use it, too&amp;hellip;but eventually they ain&amp;rsquo;t gonna be reliable enough to make deliveries. Too much risk to both our organizations. Know what I&amp;rsquo;m saying?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What happens if one of them gets clean, or finds religion, or gets busted? You and your club could find yourselves in court or, worse, in another jail cell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I got a better solution. Sell them to me.&amp;rdquo; Jingles&amp;rsquo; expression was serious. &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll take them off your hands, and I guarantee they&amp;rsquo;ll never be a threat to your organization in the future.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Is that right?&amp;rdquo; Despite the fact that he knew the black man was trustworthy, Shane couldn&amp;rsquo;t help sneering just a little. &amp;ldquo;For argument&amp;rsquo;s sake, say I&amp;rsquo;m interested. How could you guarantee they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be a risk? You gonna babysit them?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;In a way,&amp;rdquo; Jingles conceded very quietly. &amp;ldquo;Listen, I have another side of my business where these girls could be put to good use. It&amp;rsquo;s extremely profitable, and I&amp;rsquo;ll take care of any disposals.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Silently Shane considered his offer. It would definitely solve his biggest problem, because Jingles was right&amp;mdash;sooner or later the girls would be too hooked on Meth to be useful, and they&amp;rsquo;d become a security risk. Meth always took over. No exceptions. And since the club wanted to avoid simply murdering them, they were a loose end he hadn&amp;rsquo;t figured out how to tie off yet. This would be both painless and profitable.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;How much?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jingles hid his satisfaction behind a casual smile. &amp;ldquo;Well, let&amp;rsquo;s take the mule I met this afternoon. If you were interested in selling her today, I&amp;rsquo;d go as high as $50k, cash on delivery. Man, she just looks like a walking, talking good time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;The girls I buy from you will either work for me, or I&amp;rsquo;ll sell them to buyers overseas. In most cases, they&amp;rsquo;ll start by working with higher-end clients&amp;hellip;but eventually we&amp;rsquo;ll move them to the street. They won&amp;rsquo;t stay in one place for long, and we&amp;rsquo;ll manage their drug use as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Sooner or later,&amp;rdquo; he admitted, glancing at Shane, &amp;ldquo;they reach a point where their expenses outweigh their income. When that happens, we sell them to organizations in other countries, and those girls never return. Less profit that way,&amp;rdquo; he added, cautiously glancing around again, &amp;ldquo;but I still make money, and the girls still disappear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Once in a while, a girl like Crystal comes along, and my overseas clients will buy her immediately. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen very often,&amp;rdquo; he conceded, leaning back on the bench. &amp;ldquo;But when it does, the chick brings a really high price.&amp;rdquo;" />
