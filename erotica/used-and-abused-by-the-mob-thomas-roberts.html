&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&amp;#39;t know what to expect when I was led out of the bar by Vlad. Doug looked so alone. I was an emotional mess leaving the husband I loved so dearly but knowing there was no way to avoid being taken by Vlad.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was still shocked by the threat to my husband. It had sounded unreal, like a line from a gangster movie. But Vlad didn&amp;#39;t make empty threats, I knew he meant what he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I sat next to Vlad in the backseat of a huge black SUV, Michael drove. Vlad was such a strong, dangerous man. I tried to deny the warm rush running through my body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Neither man said a word to me until we were several blocks away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s nice to see you again, Candy,&amp;quot; Vlad said, in a flat voice. His voice made my skin prickle, and goosebumps of excitement covered my arms and legs. My sex felt achy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, Vlad noticed. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re excited, aren&amp;#39;t you, Candy?&amp;quot; he looked over at me. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s no sense lying about it. You&amp;#39;re mine now.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shivered, knowing I now belonged to Vlad. &amp;quot;Where are we going?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Michael laughed and Vlad said, &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re going to your new home so you can meet the boys. You like meeting new people, don&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Vlad&amp;#39;s voice was flat and cold toward me. I was terrified, and aroused. I had no say in where I was taken or what Vlad&amp;#39;s boys did to me. A combination of fear, anxiety and arousal pounded through my body. Vlad was incredibly appealing. He was handsome as well as rich and powerful; and he had a huge down there. The problem was: he didn&amp;#39;t care what happened to me, or if he ruined my marriage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I squeezed my knees together and felt the buzz it caused. For some reason Vlad excited me more than my husband ever had.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We pulled into a large driveway entrance under an industrial building. Michael maneuvered the SUV among several large garbage trucks and backed into a spot marked private,&amp;#39; next to a heavy looking steel door.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Michael pointed me toward the steel door which was rapidly closing behind Vlad&amp;#39;s back. Once through, I was met by a short, strong looking older man with only a fringe of black hair surrounding a shiny bald dome. He was wearing a dirty, torn tee shirt, and a pistol. He seemed to know only a few words of English, making him hard to understand through his thick Russian accent.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Take off,&amp;quot; was all he said, pointing at my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Where?&amp;quot; I asked. We were in a room with plain egg yolk colored walls and a concrete floor covered in a patchwork of thin rugs. There was a small bar at one end of the room along with five sets of tables and chairs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Men were standing at the bar and sitting at some of the tables. Two were playing pool in one corner. All had stopped what they&amp;#39;d been doing to watch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Here. Take. Off,&amp;quot; he repeated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You want me to strip here?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Here. &lt;i&gt;Glupyy&lt;/i&gt;,&amp;quot; he yelled. Later I was told he&amp;#39;d called me stupid. It could have been worse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
