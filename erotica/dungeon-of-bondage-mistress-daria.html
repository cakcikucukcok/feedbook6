  <title>Dungeon of Bondage - Mistress Daria</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I had been asking her for weeks, but it had seemed like forever, &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;What is behind that door?&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her response had always been the same.&lt;i&gt; &amp;ldquo;Be careful for what you wish for&amp;hellip;..&amp;rdquo;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My day had finally come.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I showed up at that afternoon, she took me to the locked door.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She asked me, &lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;Do you really want to know what is in this room? You may fear what is on the other side of this door.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m ready.&amp;quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She laughed, unlocked the door and before she turned on the light. She said, &lt;i&gt;&amp;ldquo;This my little slut, is my &lt;b&gt;Dungeon of Bondage&lt;/b&gt;&amp;rdquo;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There were&lt;b&gt; posts with pulleys to bind my body and suspend me. Stocks &lt;/b&gt;.... lowered enough to&lt;b&gt; make me bend over while my neck and wrists fit in the holds&lt;/b&gt;. There were &lt;b&gt;hooks in the floor ... to tie me down on my hands and knees, &lt;/b&gt;along with&lt;b&gt; a padded sawhorse&lt;/b&gt; that had &lt;b&gt;straps on each leg to tie my wrists and ankles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I walked to that and slid my hand over the padding, looked back at her, and &lt;b&gt;licked my lips.&lt;/b&gt; There was &lt;b&gt;a work bench with a number of toys &lt;/b&gt;to be used, including &lt;b&gt;an electronic wand, a set of three crops, a flogger, several paddles, and a whip. &lt;/b&gt;She watched &lt;b&gt;my body tremble &lt;/b&gt;as I touched them. There were&lt;b&gt; handcuffs, wrist and ankle bracelets, and an abundant supply of rope.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I looked at her. Anxiety and fear had me like a deer in headlights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Maybe she was right after all...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
