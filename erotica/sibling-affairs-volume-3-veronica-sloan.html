  <title>Sibling Affairs - Volume 3 - Veronica Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In this collection of five taboo tales, siblings are terrible at keeping their dirty secrets. The bundle opens with a sexy vignette about a man, his sister, and her talent for sloppy satisfaction. Then, in &amp;quot;Blind Man&amp;#39;s Bluff,&amp;quot; Dan finds himself in the wrong place at the exact right time. His sister is naked, horny, and handcuffed to the bed...and she thinks Dan is her boyfriend!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;re both a little crazy,&amp;quot; I sighed. &amp;quot;I love you. And I&amp;#39;ll do what you tell me to do. But what if I hadn&amp;#39;t come? What&amp;#39;s next time look like?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She squirmed out of her seatbelt and lunged into my chest. She clawed at my shoulders and I wrapped her up in a big bear hug. Then I slid the seat back and let her bawl into my chest. I kept my hand on her back while she cried and cried and cried.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She wiped her nose on her ripped sleeve and delicately took my hand. She spent a long while licking up the blood, rolling her pink tongue over the pad of my callused palm and sucking my fingers between her lips. &amp;quot;Thank you,&amp;quot; she whispered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Please tell me you don&amp;#39;t do this just for me to rescue you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She kissed my ear. &amp;quot;Thank you, big brother.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not okay, Beck.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She kissed my temple. Her hands touched the scars on my neck. &amp;quot;I have an idea.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I had heard enough of Becky&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;ideas&amp;quot; to know it was not going to solve her problems. It would only be a distraction. And sure enough...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;How about I&amp;#39;m your slave for the weekend?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;No. What does that have to do with anything?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I said I&amp;#39;d make it up to you. You&amp;#39;re hurt. I feel bad.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Date guys that aren&amp;#39;t psychopaths. That would make me feel better.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She grinned. &amp;quot;Okay, but I&amp;#39;ll be your slave for the weekend. I&amp;#39;ll do anything you want me to do.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s not what I&amp;#39;m asking you to do,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Sure it is.&amp;quot; She kissed my lips. &amp;quot;We can do it at Carl&amp;#39;s place.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I pushed her away from me. &amp;quot;What do you mean?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Becky reached into her pocket and pulled out a ring of keys. &amp;quot;Carl has a house in the hills. We can spend the weekend there. No bad boys, just you and me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I stared at the ring of keys. I stared at my sister. Her wide wet eyes were devious, but also fragile. &amp;quot;What do you mean?&amp;quot; I said again, more slowly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll be your slave and you can make me do anything you want. I&amp;#39;ll get you the paper or rub your feet or make you breakfast...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Like a dog or something.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her grin was not sisterly at all. &amp;quot;Yeah, like a dog or something.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shook my head. &amp;quot;How did you get those keys?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Doesn&amp;#39;t matter. They&amp;#39;re mine now, and the police have Carl. He&amp;#39;s not going to come up. No one will be there. Except us. Our place. Ours.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We shouldn&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You know why.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She kissed my lips again. &amp;quot;Let me take care of you.&amp;quot; She pressed her body against me and I felt her softness underneath the tattered shirt. &amp;quot;You can punish me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t want to punish you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes you do,&amp;quot; she whispered. She took my bitten hand and sucked it between her lips again. &amp;quot;Please. No more waiting. I&amp;#39;m tired of waiting.&amp;quot; She squirmed in my lap. &amp;quot;Tired of watching other girls take my man...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
