  <title>Pantherra Unleashed - Adion Cole</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Jane, Suzette, and Valentine&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;  are three seriously dedicated entrepreneurs who run Business Documents by Secretarial Mechanics, a lucrative double endeavor with a sweet-ass retirement package. To the casual observer, they provide perfectly legitimate clerical services to their clients, but to those in the know, the menu of additional services offered is what they crave.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just as there are rules in the jungle, there are rules for what happens behind the scenes at their office. Each person who enters the domain of the Mistresses of Pantherraa professional dungeonmust obey these rules or risk being denied the pleasure of their control. Just as mothers tend to their young, dominants tend to their submissives. Lessons are taught, learned, and handed down. It is a society in perfect balance for those lucky enough to experience it in the flesh.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;Just how does a 401(k) plan work when youve passed on the usual nine-to-five career path to become a dominatrix? Outside the dungeon, their everyday lives are far from mundane and humdrum. Theyre no different from any other personexcept maybe for the fact that they are paid well for living out the fantasy (while wearing some seriously sexy and sometimes scary attire). Lydia, their receptionist/secretary, balances out the whole system while she juggles her own interests and insecurities, with good reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Congratulations.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have been summoned by the Mistresses. Do you dare to disobey their command?&lt;/p&gt;" />
