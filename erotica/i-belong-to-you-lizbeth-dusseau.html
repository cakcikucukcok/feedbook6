  <title>I Belong To You - Lizbeth Dusseau</title>
      <meta name="description" content="After an unexpected three-year interruption, Michelle Monroe begins her life anew as a documentary journalist - a major change from the hideous years she spent at the hands of Middle Eastern terrorists who kidnapped her for sexual slavery. Freed by a sympathetic but dangerous soldier of fortune, Col. Daniel Broc, she&#39;s determined to put the past to rest...to put aside slavery, dungeons, humiliation and pain...but can she? Will she be allowed to live without the threat of slavery hanging over her head? She&#39;s in love with Steven, an All-American gentleman and a skilled lover with a surprisingly kinky streak she can&#39;t wait to explore. Life couldn&#39;t be more perfect... that is until anonymous notes begin to arrive alluding to her past. She&#39;s rightfully alarmed. As the torrid memories of her slave life resurface, she obsessively seeks out risky sexual interludes with strangers in public places. And when Aman, a terrorist from that &#39;other&#39; life, appears out nowhere to reclaim her as his slave, she&#39;s forced to submit to his villainous schemes, to torture and sexual exploitation, or risk the lives of those she loves. Her life with Steven must end. Only one small ray of hope remains in Daniel Broc, whose sudden reappearance is as unexpected as Aman&#39;s. What does it mean? Is he there to take her as his own, or to set her free again? Who will her life belong to when the war between these three men ends? To the savage Aman and his brand of abject slavery? Or to Steven and the peaceful future he promises. Or to the Colonel, whose dark influence has never disappeared, despite time and distance. One thing is certain - Michelle can deny the truth no longer. She must dive back into the dark realms of submissive sexuality with the man who finally wins her." />
