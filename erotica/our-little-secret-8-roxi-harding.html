  <title>Our Little Secret #8 - Roxi Harding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Oh God, don&#39;t stop.&quot;
Everybody remembers their first time. But when you&#39;re a little brat and that first time is with the prince of the house ... well, that&#39;s definitely something you&#39;ll never forget!
How can you say no to this?
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~
As Riley waits for Paige, his 18-year old stepsister, to come back out and show him some clothes she just bought, he wanders around her room.
Here&#39;s her desk, where she does work for her college courses. Here&#39;s her bookshelf, where she has some of her classic favorites. Riley remembers reading Paige to sleep when she was just a little sister ... it&#39;s funny how time flies.
&quot;Okay!&quot; Paige calls out, and a moment later she comes into the room wearing her new clothes.
Riley nods. &quot;Not bad, not bad,&quot; he says. Paige smiles at him.
&quot;I know, right?&quot; she says. &quot;And these things were so cheap, I thought they were joking.&quot;
Riley barks out laughter and Paige smiles up at him.
Ever since she turned 18, Riley feels like Paige&#39;s been a whole different person. Smart and sexy, she goes to college and Riley completely envies the boys who get to see her there, shaking that ass of hers all day. Of course, he gets to see her at home, in a towel when she comes out of the shower, wearing hardly anything on her days off.
&quot;So ... which did you say was your favorite outfit?&quot; Paige asks her stepbrother as she approaches him.
&quot;Oh, well,&quot; he says. &quot;They all look so good.&quot;
She stops in front of him, her eyes up, locked onto his.
&quot;Is that right?&quot; she asks. Her voice sounds deep now ... sultry. Riley has to swallow.
&quot;Yeah,&quot; he says. &quot;That&#39;s right.&quot;
Riley looks down at his little sister, at his own stepsister Paige. She&#39;s looking up at him, neither of them speaking, and Riley&#39;s surprised to find crazy, twisted thoughts go through his head.
Thoughts of grabbing onto Paige, kissing her hard and fast and with passion. Thoughts of tearing her clothes off, seeing her fully naked body up close. Thoughts of taking her…
&quot;You know, Riley,&quot; Paige says. &quot;I ... I think I have to tell you something.&quot;
&quot;Oh?&quot; Riley asks his stepsister, raising an eyebrow. &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;
