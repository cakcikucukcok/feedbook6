  <title>Twins: Breeding with Daddy - Sara Kitty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My twin sister Mia and I know that our daddy needs to relax. He hasn&#39;t been seeing anyone, and he needs a release. 
We also want babies, but no other man would be a more perfect father than our own. So we&#39;re going to seduce daddy tonight and he&#39;ll fill us with his seed.
*Hot daddy daughter erotica with TWINS. You&#39;ll be quivering in your panties when you read this story.*
Now, let me back up for a second. Mia and I loved daddy. He was a successful alpha male who always gave his girls whatever we wanted. But he had no one in his life to take care of his sexual needs. We knew this because he often told us how frustrated it was that he couldn’t find the right woman. But that was okay with us, because we had decided that we were the right women for daddy and we were going to seduce him and have his babies. 
Mia poured daddy a tall glass of merlot. 
“Can I get you anything else, daddy?” She asked. She flashed him her perfect smile. Tonight we were wearing short skirts with red v neck tops that showed off our matching 34DD’s. 
“I’m good, sweetie,” he said. 
“Are you sure daddy? You’ve looked really stressed out lately,” I offered.
“I am. Big case coming up. I just need to get laid.” He laughed and took a sip of wine. 
“Mia and I were thinking, daddy…and we decided to do something for you.”
“What’s that, princess?”
I looked at Mia. She nodded. That was my signal to proceed. We each pulled our tops off. We weren’t wearing bras. His eyes got big." />
