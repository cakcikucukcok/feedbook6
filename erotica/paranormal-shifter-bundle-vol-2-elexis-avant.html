      <meta name="description" content="Five more hot, sexy tales in one low cost bundle! Approximately 25,000 words in all. Titles include:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
HOT FOR TWO ALPHAS&lt;br /&gt;
Just a week from the most important decision of her life, Nicki Francis must choose between following her werewolf lineage or joining a tribe. Or perhaps she&amp;#39;ll sacrifice it all to be a normal human?&lt;br /&gt;
The thing is, when you&amp;rsquo;re about to turn 21 and you&amp;rsquo;ve got no experience with men...it&amp;rsquo;s all about the sexy, hunky, fit men, not tribal tradition or culture that factors into these decisions.&lt;br /&gt;
Two rival werewolf alphas want her, bad. And Richard and Ferdinand will do whatever it takes to seduce Nicki into siding with them.&lt;br /&gt;
Which hunk will she choose? Perhaps Nicki will test both...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THE WOLF&amp;#39;S CURVY MIDNIGHT APPETITE&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;rsquo;s such an alpha male &amp;mdash; he knows what he wants, and he takes it.&lt;br /&gt;
Tara hasn&amp;rsquo;t had much chance to explore her love life, being a busy graveyard shift reporter. Writing about the Forrester attacks &amp;mdash; a series of seemingly vigilante crimes against men on the run from the law by what is reputedly a werewolf &amp;mdash; tells her she should avoid driving down there.&lt;br /&gt;
But when she gets into a nasty accident and is saved from certain doom by Wade,&lt;br /&gt;
a seemingly good samaritan, everything changes.&lt;br /&gt;
The more Tara spends time with Wade, the more she realizes there&amp;rsquo;s some hidden secret to his bestial, passionate yet gentle, loving ways&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THE WOLF LOVES MY CURVES&lt;br /&gt;
He&amp;rsquo;s such an alpha male. He knows what he wants, and he takes it.&lt;br /&gt;
Nadia&amp;rsquo;s been dating Kurt for a few weeks, and the passion and intensity of their love making has been electric. She loves his athleticism, sex appeal and passion for the environment. He loves her sharp wit, geeky interests, and most of all...her curvy, Rubenesque body.&lt;br /&gt;
But the more he&amp;rsquo;s involved with her, the closer she is to discovering his dark secret...a revelation that will threaten her very own life.&lt;br /&gt;
An incredibly hot paranormal romance with a real, alpha male werewolf lover who&amp;rsquo;s obsessed with his BBW mate&amp;rsquo;s curvy body!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
WHAT THE WERE-BEAR WANTS&lt;br /&gt;
Jared Ursa has been hunted all his life, simply for being born a shifter, and like every male in his family, he can transform into a giant black bear at will.&lt;br /&gt;
Hiding out in the woods, he crosses paths with Diana, a huntress dedicated to bringing him in. Sexy, sultry, and definitely dangerous, Diana makes a formidable foe.&lt;br /&gt;
But their face-to-face encounter changes the whole perspective of their relationship: from hunter and hunted to sexy, steamy lovers.&lt;br /&gt;
She&amp;rsquo;s entranced by his passionate, predatory nature tempered by a natural gentility; he can&amp;rsquo;t stop thinking about how she&amp;rsquo;s the first woman not to be afraid of him...and his size...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
THE BEAR STOLE MY HEART&lt;br /&gt;
Won&amp;rsquo;t you come protect me?&lt;br /&gt;
All her life, Jenny&amp;rsquo;s been an accidental troublemaker: a good girl playing the role of a brat. What she needs, her family decides, is to figure things out on her own. And so Jenny is forced to swap her high-flying city life for a more quiet living out in the woods.&lt;br /&gt;
Enter Conrad, the dark and daring lumberjack living next door, whose gentle sensibilities leaves him surprised by her spoiled upper-class attitude.&lt;br /&gt;
As they come to terms with each other, their attraction is very real &amp;mdash; but little does Jenny know, Conrad&amp;rsquo;s protectiveness and chivalrous nature comes from his grizzly-sized secret: the well-endowed lumberjack is also a primal bear shifter.&lt;br /&gt;
Will Conrad&amp;rsquo;s desire to make Jenny his mate be too much, too soon for the clueless city girl? Or will Jenny acknowledge her need for an alpha male who&amp;rsquo;ll help her get back on her feet?" />
