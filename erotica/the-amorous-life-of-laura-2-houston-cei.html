  <title>The Amorous Life of Laura 2 - Houston Cei</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Super sex bomb Laura is back in action! She, her immediate family and best friends offer a sensual drama with intrigue and surprises in her journey through life as a single mother. She raises her son Jason to be a fine gentleman with&amp;nbsp; ambitions. He is&amp;nbsp; handsome with a passion for body-building. The sexy body he has built is very appealing to Laura and she wants to be more than just a mother.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After going steady and even living together for about ten years, Sandy and Roy finally decided to get married and have a family. Witnessing the joy that motherhood brought to Laura inspired them both to become parents. The Fitzgerald&amp;#39;s were delighted with the news and offered to help with the wedding plans.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was an outdoor occasion in the month of May at the New Brighton Beach in Capitola, California and was attended by the families and closest friends of both the bride and groom. Laura was the bridesmaid, Jason the ring bearer and Sandy&amp;#39;s father was to give the bride away. Plans for the honey moon were all set:&amp;nbsp; they would be going back to Jamaica the island of paradise they loved so much several years ago. This time there would be an added treat:&amp;nbsp; Janet and Blake would be going with them for an entire week. Normally, honeymooners are expected to enjoy a period of harmony together alone, but Sandy and Roy, and the Fitzgerald&amp;#39;s are certainly not commonplace persons by anyone&amp;#39;s standards. Laura had to stay with Jason and could not be included, but she was nevertheless amused by the plans.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The two couples were all smiles when they checked in at the hotel in Jamaica. They were not at all concerned that the desk clerk seemed confused that all four of them would be in the honeymoon suite. Maybe this was a first, but it did not matter because there was plenty of room, and it had a king bed. The accommodations were more than adequate for this sensual foursome.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sandy and Roy knew their way around the island and were looking forward to enjoying the sights and activities with their friends, but first it was time to dress for the occasion. The long airplane ride called for refreshing showers after which Roy and Blake wore shorts and tee shirts while Sandy and Janet displayed their physical charms in bikinis. When Roy first saw Janet come out of the bathroom, he could not help but let out his favorite expression, &amp;quot;Whoa!&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; He knew that his bride would now be wearing the skimpiest of bikinis but he was not sure what to expect from Janet. All eyes were on the voluptuous woman who was now now in her fifties, but as sexy as even the imagination would allow. She and Sandy were both revealing plenty of skin in their thong style attire. Janet&amp;#39;s breasts were now about 44 double Ds and her large nips made their impression on the bikini top as just a glimpse of their color was also visible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Is my wife going to get arrested?&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; Blake asked with a chuckle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry, Blake,&amp;quot; Roy responded, &amp;quot;there will be plenty of women showing off their asses in thong bathing suits, but we&amp;#39;ve got the best.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sandy was not jealous of the attention Janet was getting from her husband, but rather was pleased to have such a sexy friend, whose sexy charms they would both enjoy before the day was over.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Roy took Sandy by the hand addressed Blake, &amp;quot;Well, my good friend, we&amp;#39;ve traded partners before but now it&amp;#39;s official. We are wife-swappers.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp; He presented his wife&amp;#39;s hand to Blake and the four burst out laughing. They were all ready for a great time in this Caribbean paradise with Janet and Roy as partners while Sandy paired with Blake." />
