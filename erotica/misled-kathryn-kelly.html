  <title>Misled - Kathryn Kelly</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Christopher &amp;ldquo;Outlaw&amp;rdquo; Caldwell deals in a world of violence, sex, drugs, and crudity. As current president of the Death Dwellers&amp;#39; MC, he presides over a club in chaos after the death of their longtime president and his mentor, Joseph &amp;quot;Boss&amp;quot; Foy. Outlaw is trying to keep everything with the club in his control. What happens when more trouble arises in the form of a blonde haired, 18 year old, beauty with the same eyes as his former mentor?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Outlaw growled in approval at the pink flesh descending toward his hungry mouth. His tongue met wet pussy, his fingers digging into the hips of the other bitch riding his dick. The one on his mouth wiggled and he lapped her juices, satisfied at the identical squeals and moans the two were making. She hammered her pussy against his lips. He thrust his tongue into her entrance and swirled, matching the thrust of his cock and the quick swivel of his hips.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Fuck, but these bitches were good. He&amp;rsquo;d been fucking the two of them on a regular basis for six months now and saw no sign of tiring of them. Kiera and Ellen. Bitches he&amp;rsquo;d randomly picked one evening out of sheer boredom. They thought to change his mind and wanted him to pick one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Nah, bitches. They&amp;rsquo;d be in his bed his way or no way, a point they&amp;rsquo;d quickly picked up on. After the first night of fucking, he&amp;rsquo;d left it up to them to decide. If they wanted to continue to fuck him, they&amp;rsquo;d have to tag team him. Otherwise, they could move the fuck on and so would he.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They&amp;rsquo;d chosen wisely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the background, Hendrix&amp;rsquo;s rendition of Voodoo Child played on repeat. Outlaw thought the song the most appropriate since these two bitches had used their pussies and mouths to put a spell on him and his dick. If truth be told, he had a soft spot for Kiera with her olive complexion and black hair long enough to cover the aureoles on her very delectable breasts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Kiera was so easy-going. If she hadn&amp;rsquo;t fucked most of the other brothers, Outlaw might&amp;rsquo;ve considered throwing Ellen aside and making Kiera his old lady. She was twenty-five, a perfect age to his way of thinking. Still young enough not to hear the tick-tock of the internal clock women freaked over, but old enough where she&amp;rsquo;d lived a little, had her own job and her own place. She was faultless, but for her whoring. Sharing a bitch was cool, but Outlaw refused to bring said bitch to meet his mother. Most of the club knew the feel of Kiera&amp;rsquo;s pussy, so she remained just pussy to him and he&amp;rsquo;d keep it that way.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ellen, on the other hand, was only two years younger than he was. She&amp;rsquo;d started intruding on his space and time without Kiera. Her actions and growing possessiveness just showed Outlaw the bitch had no loyalty to a girl she called a sister. Ellen smiled in Kiera&amp;rsquo;s face, fucked her when Outlaw ordered, while steadily trying to move her out of their m&amp;eacute;nage-a-trois. She also sucked good dick and did whatever shit Outlaw or any of the other boys asked of her.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Was he really fucking thinking about this shit now? With his dick in Kiera and his tongue in Ellen? Well, fuck. Maybe, the charms of their pussies were wearing away. Determined to focus on fucking, Outlaw nipped Ellen&amp;rsquo;s clit and she squealed, grinding her pussy against his mouth, starting to come." />
