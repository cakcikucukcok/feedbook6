  <title>Redhead x2 - C. Caine</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Redhead Danni and her brother Devin have been fucking since college, something they&amp;rsquo;ve been careful to keep a secret.&amp;nbsp; But Devin has been keeping another secret: he has been selling himself in drag to older men with a taste for trannie ass.&amp;nbsp; The problem is that as &amp;ldquo;Danielle&amp;rdquo; he looks just like his shy sister.&amp;nbsp; Danni loves her brother&amp;hellip;but does she love him enough to let him take her identity?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Devin reached down and caught Danni&amp;rsquo;s ass-cheeks in both hands, squeezing hard with his nails digging into her pale skin.&amp;nbsp; She gasped around his tongue as they continued kissing, then sucked hard at it, channeling her frenzied desire into that simple oral motion. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Devin fucked her hard, shoving in and out of her as the waters of the pool splashed and foamed around them.&amp;nbsp; It was a steady, pistonlike rhythm, the way she liked it. She bumped back hard, smashing her clit against the rough firm mass of his pubes and pubic bone.&amp;nbsp; Like jilling off in her room, but so much sweeter.&lt;br /&gt;
