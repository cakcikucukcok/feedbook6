  <title>Humiliation Training Book Bundle/Anthology - Daisy Rose</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Nicky&amp;#39;s trouble starts when she goes to a doctor for her creaming problems. Her sexy doctor no qualms helping her with his bare hands - and lips - or bringing friends in to witness her shameful problem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This complete trilogy brings you on Nicky&amp;#39;s journey from an innocent, naive young woman to a humiliated, submissive exhibitionist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The good doctor tells me you have an interesting problem on your hands,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Did Doctor Denver tell him?! &amp;quot;Isn&amp;#39;t that breaking some sort of doctor-patient confidentiality?&amp;quot; I asked, aghast.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; he muttered, closing in on me again, trapping me into a corner like a dangerous animal. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s a reason I like my cleaners to be sexy, beautiful creatures,&amp;quot; he muttered and with a groan, pulled me closer to kiss me repeatedly, words dripping from his lips like raindrops in between his frantic kisses. Beautiful. Hot. Sexy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The elevator betrayed us and started moving, then sprung open with a loud &amp;#39;ding&amp;#39; that should have stopped him in his tracks. Instead, he continued to kiss me even as the door opened. My eyes widened as I let the handsome stranger kiss me all over my cheek and down my neck, expert fingers undoing the buttons on my blouse as his kisses continued to my breasts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I should stop this insanity, but my fingers tightened on his muscular arms and I couldn&amp;#39;t move at all. I wasn&amp;#39;t sure if the moans were coming from my lips. I didn&amp;#39;t know I was capable of making noises like that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thankfully, there was nobody beyond the door to witness the utterly embarrassing way I was letting this gorgeous stranger devour me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He found the pulse at the curve of my neck and teased it with his tongue, sucking and licking to make desires in my belly dance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I threw my head back and closed my eyes. I imagined how his lips would feel like on my nipple, tracing the soft tip before taking it into his mouth and sucking gently. The vision of him drinking in my milk made me immeasurably wet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wouldn&amp;#39;t it be nice if the doctor was here too? I bit my lip and let out another soft moan. The pleasure pulsing through me was enough to drive me to completion and he hasn&amp;#39;t even started touching me yet. He was busy taking my clothes off.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What?! He was taking my clothes off!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Stop! Stop!&amp;quot; I gasped, pushing him off me again. Trembling fingers redid the buttons on my blouse and I bent down to pull my skirt up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He wiped saliva from his lips with the back of his hand and chuckled. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re really innocent, aren&amp;#39;t you?&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I huffed and avoided meeting his eyes as I tried to make myself proper again. &amp;quot;With all due respect, I&amp;#39;m here to work.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, you are,&amp;quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With great effort, I pushed back the desire and embarrassment pooling in my core and stood straight up. I cleared my throat. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;d like to keep things professional,&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;This is important to me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re&amp;nbsp; going to have to learn to do a lot more if you want to stay here,&amp;quot; he said mysteriously, walking out of the elevator before I could ask him what he meant." />
