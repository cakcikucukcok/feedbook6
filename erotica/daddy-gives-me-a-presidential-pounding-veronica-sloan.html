  <title>Daddy Gives Me a Presidential Pounding - Veronica Sloan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION
Irena&#39;s daddy is an arrogant, womanizing billionaire...and the next President of the United States! Daniel Blunt, real estate mogul and television star, has just been elected Commander-in-Chief, but with this unprecedented victory comes a personal defeat. If he&#39;s to run the country, he has to end his affair with his beautiful daughter Irena! The two sneak off to celebrate with one final night of passion.
EXCERPT
I screamed at the television. I threw the remote at the cheap hotel screen and cursed their children. Joe, standing beside my sister&#39;s children, covered their ears and told me to calm down. I whirled on him (it took all my willpower not to spit in his wormy face) and drew myself up to my full, imposing height. I&#39;d gotten my legs from my mother and my height from my father, and I knew how to use both. &quot;You listen to me, you gutless-&quot;
Daddy silenced me with a gesture. &quot;Joe, boys, would you give us the room?&quot;
Joe started to protest but my brothers laid their hands on his shoulders and gingerly escorted him out. Paul and Taylor, Tanya&#39;s kids, followed close behind. Then the door shut and it was just me and daddy in his private suite.
He placed his hand on my bare thigh. I was wearing a $12,000 Valentino sleeveless cocktail dress. A jeweled rainbow was sewn into the translucent neckline. With his other hand, he lightly traced an emerald constellation. &quot;You&#39;ve got to control that temper, baby.&quot;
I wanted to scream at him, too. I wasn&#39;t his little girl anymore. I was 30-years-old, with companies of my own and a husband worth less than a third of my annual income. But when he looked me in the eye, when he drew his index finger under my chin, none of that mattered. I&#39;d always be his little girl. &quot;I can&#39;t bear it,&quot; I told him, my voice near to breaking. &quot;I can&#39;t bear to hear them talk about you that way.&quot;
He stroked my cheek. &quot;Let &#39;em talk, baby.&quot;
I swept his hand away. &quot;Don&#39;t &#39;baby&#39; me! You have to take this seriously!&quot;
The hand on my thigh tightened its grip. The fingers felt scalding hot. &quot;I do,&quot; he said. He pressed his body close. &quot;I take it very seriously, princess. And they can talk all they want, cause I&#39;m gonna win.&quot;
&quot;How do you know that?&quot; I whispered, my body shaking. The hand was sliding up my thigh. I knew the answer. It was always the same answer, but it thrilled me to ask and he knew it. 
He clutched my ass under the dress. &quot;Because it&#39;s what I want. And I always get what I want.&quot; Then he grabbed the emeralds in my $12,000 Valentino and split it apart like tissue paper. His mouth met mine in a searing kiss and he filled his hands with my breasts. 
He pushed me down on the bed. &quot;Let it all out, baby,&quot; he commanded. So I screamed. I screamed at the liberal media that dared to insult our family, I screamed at his crooked opponent who said she cared about the working class, I screamed at our own party full of inept and insubordinate dinosaurs. I screamed out my rage, and daddy pulled my hair and gave me a spanking.
Later that evening I&#39;d have to wear a new dress in front of my husband. No doubt he wondered what happened to the Valentino, but he didn&#39;t say a thing. He knew his place. In private, my brothers would whisper to my father that he had to be more careful, but they&#39;d never push too hard. They knew their places too. I was his favorite. I had always been his favorite. Daddy was the only man who could tell me what to do.
