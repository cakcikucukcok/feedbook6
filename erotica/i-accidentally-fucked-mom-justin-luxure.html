  <title>I Accidentally Fucked Mom - Justin Luxure</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I should tell her, but it feels too good to stop. I may never have another opportunity like this, so for now I&amp;rsquo;ll keep my mouth shut and enjoy my Mother&amp;rsquo;s body. When Chris finds an open invite to an orgy, he fights his nerves and shows up. With everyone wearing a mask, he discovers an unexpected guest at the party: his Mother! Forbidden fruit has never looked so appetizing and Chris doesn&amp;rsquo;t plan on revealing his identity before he has a taste.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;EXCERPT:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I didn&amp;rsquo;t say a word and let her do what she wanted. I was finally going to see the entire body of the woman I just made cum. She had long raven black hair with a hint of purple. Freckles covering her back, but stopping just above her ass and centred on her lower back was a faded butterfly tattoo&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Wait! This can&amp;rsquo;t be. I felt the sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach again, but this time for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Jake by the way,&amp;rdquo; I said. &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s your name?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wanted to make sure and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use my real name.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m Alyssa,&amp;rdquo; she said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My life flashed before my eyes as I watched my Mother lower herself onto my cock. The thought that she had been cheating on my Father was the furthest thing from my mind. I felt as though I was doing something wrong, I needed to say something. On the other hand I was having my greatest fantasy come true and didn&amp;rsquo;t even know it." />
