An uneasiness crosses her as she steps in and sees her husband bound to a chair.  Three big black men are frozen as they stare at her.  They seem to know her, and they know her husband&#39;s name.  Maria wonders if her husband wants her to fulfill a drunken fantasy they shared.  The three big black man grin and unwrap their chocolate bars..." />
