  <title>Her Lesson In Lust - Anna Austin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Jane stumbles across the country inn, she is grateful. Cold, wet and alone, she needs a fire to dry herself and a warm bed for the night. When the innkeeper and his brothers are a little flirtatious, she thinks it harmless enough.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But she is wrong. Awoken from her slumbers, she finds herself surrounded by strong, horny men...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, it&amp;#39;s usually farmers that pass through here, a nobleman or two. It&amp;#39;s rarely a girl like you,&amp;quot; agreed James.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jane pressed her lips together to suppress a nervous smile. She did not know what she was supposed to answer to that, if she was supposed to answer at all. She was not used to being flirted with and it made her feel awkward and tongue-tied, but at the same time, it was flattering in its own way. She would not consider her a great beauty; she knew prettier and more elegant girls than herself, but the comments, while unfamiliar and strange, were not unwelcome.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Luckily, Harry came to her rescue. &amp;quot;And as pretty as she is, she must also be tired. James, show her to her room, will you?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Right this way,&amp;quot; James said with an exaggerated bow and gestured the stairs, before taking an oil lamp from a shelf.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jane bid the other brothers goodnight and followed James. The landlord was right, Jane was feeling quite tired, but after some sleep and a breakfast, she would be ready to continue her journey. With any luck, the weather would be if not warmer, at least less wet in the morning, too." />
