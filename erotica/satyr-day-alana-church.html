  <title>Satyr Day - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Owen didn&amp;#39;t set out to be a hero. When he rescued the woman in the grocery store parking lot, he was just trying to help. But as a result, he found himself gifted with a strange copper bracelet. Now women around him are acting strangely. Over the span of one glorious summer day, Owen&amp;#39;s life is turned upside down. Will he accept his destiny as the messenger of a divine being? What will be his fate, and that of the women in his life, on this wonderful &amp;ldquo;Satyr Day?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Phoebe sighed. &amp;ldquo;Owen, sometimes humans really are most remarkably dense.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Did you really think you could accept the gifts you have been given, go on with your life, and not have to give something in return? For everything there is a price.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And what price will I have to pay?&amp;rdquo; Owen asked tensely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Why, belief, dear child. Faith. Eventually, possibly, priesthood. Fortunately,&amp;rdquo; she said, the smile in her voice clear, &amp;ldquo;the laws of your nation are amazingly lax. You can set yourself up as a priest of Bacchus and the only thing that will happen is that people will look at you a bit strangely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Some of the women you...serve...will be drawn to you. And your new faith. Anaya. Isabel. Samara. Or Wendy, for example. There&amp;#39;s a lusty piece of ass. I wish I had known her when I was male. She would be a perfect choice to help lead your new temple. She could draw in converts by the dozen. Male and female both.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Owen&amp;#39;s temper, already frayed, abruptly snapped. &amp;ldquo;This is ridiculous!&amp;rdquo; he shouted. &amp;ldquo;I am not a priest. I am not going to start a church worshiping some long-gone Greek god. I am not going to have a herd of horny women around me who worship Bacchus and bring in converts.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Phoebe&amp;#39;s voice grew cold. &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;#39;t want it, boy? Fine. Take off the bracelet. Throw it away. Throw it all away. Go back to your tedious, soul-sucking job. Beg for hours as a delivery boy, scrape for tips. Live one step up from poverty, if you can.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Get your precious diploma. Find a job. Marry a woman with goals as small and petty as your own. Accept mediocrity. Deny the possibility of beauty and power and passion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;And for the rest of your life, you&amp;#39;ll always wonder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;What if.&amp;rdquo;" />
