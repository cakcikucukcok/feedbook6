  <title>Banging Daddy On My Wedding Day - Trisha Treat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&#39;s Kim&#39;s wedding day, and just before the ceremony, she confesses to her maid of honor that she has always wanted to fuck her Daddy. When the father of the bride overhears their conversation, he is not about to let his hot daughter get married before fulfilling her fantasy to feel his cock buried deep in her fertile pussy. 
EXCERPT:
&quot;You look absolutely stunning, Kim. You are the most beautiful bride I have ever seen.&quot; Daddy said to me, kissing the top of my head. 
&quot;Thanks, Daddy,&quot; I nuzzled into his neck. 
&quot;Can I talk to you about something?&quot; I looked up into Daddy&#39;s eyes.
&quot;Of course, my darling. Anything.&quot; Daddy said, in his deep, reassuring voice. 
I didn&#39;t know how to begin. I was silent a moment, while I gathered the courage to tell my Daddy that I wanted him to fuck me on my wedding day.
&quot;What is it, sweetheart?&quot; Daddy asked gently. He trailed a finger over my collarbone, and then let his finger trace a trail over my cleavage. His touch made me wet, and I nervously bit my lip. He looked at me intensely, as if he could read my mind. 
I stalled, trying to find the right words. Then Daddy spoke again, &quot;Do you need something from me, baby?&quot;
I looked into his eyes and nodded. &quot;Badly.&quot; I said, my voice sounding involuntarily seductive.
&quot;Something that you&#39;re afraid to ask me for?&quot; Daddy went on. 
I nodded.
&quot;I heard you and Cassie talking in here a few minutes ago.&quot; Daddy said in a low voice, directly into my ear. My eyes widened, and I felt my face flush with embarrassment. He clutched his hard cock through his trousers and pressed it against my pelvis, letting me feel his hardness through my wedding gown. &quot;Is this want you want from me?&quot; His voice was nearly a growl. 
I swallowed hard and nodded, &quot;Yes, Daddy. Please.&quot; I said, just above a whisper." />
