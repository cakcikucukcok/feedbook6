      <meta name="description" content="For their PE essay, Futa teens Zara and Amber must try out five different condom brands...on each other! Meanwhile, Leslie is face-to-face with a futanari roller derby team who can&amp;#39;t get their heads in the game. She knows how to motivate them, promise them a big celebration afterwards in the locker room, where she&amp;#39;s the entertainment!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Is she one of your students?&amp;quot; a teammate near the back asked. &amp;quot;Does Melissa give you a hard time in class?&amp;quot; she asked mischievously, the meaning behind her question not lost on Leslie.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hall, I appreciate the support, but you need to leave. You don&amp;#39;t belong here.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes, I do!&amp;quot; she insisted. &amp;quot;You guys need all the encouragement you can get. You&amp;#39;re dying out there. I&amp;#39;m here to tell you-&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;To tell us what?&amp;quot; Psycho Cin asked, cynicism permeating from every word. She glared at the teen with hard, silver eyes. The sides of her head were shaved and her hair styled up in a shiny, red-tipped mohawk. &amp;quot;To try harder? To believe in ourselves?&amp;quot; She threw her towel on the floor. &amp;quot;They&amp;#39;re laughing at us out there. This team is a joke. We are a joke.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This set off a wave of arguments. The fifteen teammates hurled insults at one another, and some even started throwing kneepads and helmets. The tension had clearly reached the tipping point, and in the middle of it all was little Leslie Hall. Leslie couldn&amp;#39;t bear the thought of the Roughnecks skating out to the track and being laughed at like in the first half of the game.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Roughnecks!&amp;quot; she yelled, surprising herself as her voice cut above all the bickering. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s no point fighting like this. The Assassins have been whipping your butts for half an hour straight, but you still have the second half to turn this around,&amp;quot; she insisted, trying to meet each one in the eye. &amp;quot;You guys can do so much better! Look at how big and strong you all are; that&amp;#39;s why you&amp;#39;re called the Roughnecks! All you have to do is give it all you&amp;#39;ve got, and I know you can come out on top and beat those Assassins!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh, you do?&amp;quot; one of them asked. &amp;quot;Aren&amp;#39;t we lucky, girls, to have the support of this random teenager?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What makes you think we&amp;#39;re going to turn this around?&amp;quot; another woman asked. &amp;quot;Do you think your little high school pep talk is what we need?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This gave her pause. Leslie had an idea about what she wanted to say next, but hesitated. Every eye was on her, waiting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Leslie looked at Ms. Hawke, who gave her an encouraging nod. It was then that she realized what she was here for. She knew how to pass this assignment, and with flying colors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All she had to do was get this team to win.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;If...&amp;quot; she began, feeling herself grow excited at the idea. &amp;quot;If you guys win, I&amp;#39;ll be here to celebrate with you. Your number one fan, right here in the middle of the locker room, helping every single one of you celebrate your victory.&amp;quot; The teen made sure she met each woman&amp;#39;s eyes, holding it there until the message was loud and clear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What am I doing? This is crazy. There&amp;#39;s fifteen of them, and only one of me!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once it clicked, every skater&amp;#39;s eyes widened. Every last angry or dejected expression changed to one of excitement. Old foes started sharing smiles. Some bit their lips with anticipation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;So?&amp;quot; Leslie asked. &amp;quot;Are you guys in?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
They all nodded.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ll go hard,&amp;quot; Ms. Hawke said, her eyes glimmering with excitement. &amp;quot;If you promise the same after we win.&amp;quot;" />
