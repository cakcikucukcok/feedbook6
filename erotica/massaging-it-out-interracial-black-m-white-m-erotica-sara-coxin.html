  <title>Massaging It Out (Interracial Black M / White M Erotica) - Sara Coxin</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Sam lives with his wealthy partner and owns his own massage business.  He&#39;s hoping that one day the two can tie the knot.  As he prepares breakfast, he accidentally see&#39;s his boyfriend&#39;s phone light up.  Normally, he&#39;d ignore it, but he decides to pick up the phone so that he can take it back up to Ronald, who&#39;s still in bed.
His eyes glaze over the message and his heart stops.  It&#39;s a message thanking Ronald for a great night.  Sam&#39;s confused, considering Ronald was supposedly extremely busy the night before with work.  After a couple of failed attempts, Sam manages to unlock the phone and view his message history.  He finds that Ronald has not been faithful to Sam at all.
Furious, Sam devises a vengeful plan to get back at Ronald.  He invites over one of his clients, a big, black, football star by the name of Drake to get a massage at his home.  When Drake arrives, things start to get a little flirtatious and then a bit hot before things really take off.  Sam&#39;s plan is to massage out the stress... but in more ways than one!" />
