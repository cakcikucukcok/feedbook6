  <title>Mommy Needs A Baby! - Moms In Heat</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I wanted a baby. Badly! But no man compared to my son. Problem was, he didn&amp;rsquo;t know I loved him - in that way. He didn&amp;rsquo;t know I wanted him to plant a baby in my motherly belly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But I was nothing, if not insistent. I was going to get my man.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No matter what.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Excerpt:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was my last chance. The doc said I was nearing &amp;quot;that&amp;quot; age. The age that every woman either fears or embraces. The time when I could no longer safely have a baby. My husband, Jack, left me soon after Eric was born and now that he&amp;#39;d left the nest, I was feeling a bit sad and hormonal.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wanted another baby.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But I didn&amp;#39;t want just any man&amp;#39;s baby. I&amp;#39;d thought long and hard about this. I wanted my son&amp;#39;s. Yes, it came with its own set of potential problems, but that was beside the point.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was in love with my son. And NOT just in a motherly way, either. Eric was one hell of a handsome stud. Just nine-teen, six-foot tall, short, black hair and muscles for days. He set my world on fire. Every time I thought of him or saw him, I literally creamed my panties.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, he knew nothing of this. Yes, Eric, there was a reason why I always held our hugs longer than I should have. It&amp;#39;s because I loved to feel your sexy muscles and smell your masculine scent. It fucking drove me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You drove me crazy!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now I just had to figure out how to seduce him. I needed a plan. There was also that pesky girlfriend of his that I had to deal with. Perhaps I could use her to help me." />
