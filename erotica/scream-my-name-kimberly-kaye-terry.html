But Leila&#39;s blown away just watching him walk toward her: talk about sexy. Brandan&#39;s deep baritone is as easy as a long, lazy summer day--the kind of day when two hot people oughta get nice and wet. And what she sees in his eyes when he looks at her is hotter than the blazing sun. Leila will persuade him to see things her way. When her caf&amp;#233; opens for business, it&#39;s going to be a very popular place.
