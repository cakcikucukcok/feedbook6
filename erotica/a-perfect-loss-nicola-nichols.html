  <title>A Perfect Loss - Nicola Nichols</title>
      <meta name="description" content="It&amp;#39;s a perfect life, but something important is missing. Ruby is just beginning to understand that what&amp;#39;s missing from her perfect marriage is spice. When the brother of their next door neighbor shows up, home for a visit from construction work, he doesn&amp;#39;t fit in with their suburban lifestyle. He&amp;#39;s sweaty, hot, built, and doesn&amp;#39;t care about much of anything. His brother doesn&amp;#39;t think much of him, thinks he is a perfect loss--he&amp;#39;s wasted his opportunities. But Ruby finds a lot to like. Nick shows his appreciation in every hot and unprotected way imaginable. Several of them she&amp;#39;s never tried before.&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
While sitting by her pool on a sunny Sunday afternoon, sipping a gin and tonic and chatting with her husband Scott and their neighbors, Jackie and Gerald, Ruby&amp;#39;s favorite word came bubbling to the surface.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Perfect,&amp;rdquo; she said. When Jackie looked at her, she grinned. &amp;ldquo;Everything about this life is perfect.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I suppose it is,&amp;rdquo; her friend agreed.&lt;br /&gt;
Scott stood at the grill, cooking burgers and talking with Gerald about a baseball game while she and Jackie relaxed in the chaise lounge chairs. Scott was handsome and attentive and she&amp;rsquo;d made their house into exactly the kind of place she&amp;#39;d always dreamed about. They had a big mortgage, but they didn&amp;#39;t really have any money worries. Scott&amp;#39;s job paid well, and she taught high school, which didn&amp;#39;t pay so well, but let her enjoy her summers, just lazing around the pool, reading and generally indulging herself.&lt;br /&gt;
So why was she so dissatisfied? That was the question that had bothered her for some time, yet she couldn&amp;rsquo;t find any cracks in the perfection.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Gerald&amp;#39;s little brother, Nick, is coming to stay for a while,&amp;rdquo; Jackie said.&lt;br /&gt;
You couldn&amp;#39;t mistake the unsettled tone in her voice. &amp;ldquo;You don&amp;#39;t like him?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Jackie&amp;rsquo;s face took on an odd shift. &amp;ldquo;It isn&amp;rsquo;t that I don&amp;rsquo;t like him, just that he&amp;#39;s a rough sort. I feel awkward around him is all.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
The look on her face didn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit with the idea of being put off by him. There was something else.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Some people you can say are losers,&amp;rdquo; Gerald put in. &amp;ldquo;They fail at everything they try. With Nick&amp;hellip; he&amp;rsquo;s just a loss.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;A loss?&amp;rdquo; Scott found that amusing.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;To himself and everyone. He could be almost anything, do something great, but he chooses to work in construction, traveling around to jobs. And he&amp;rsquo;s just a worker, not even a foreman.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Ruby tried to picture their disappointment. Nick was a perfect loss.&lt;br /&gt;
The thought intrigued her, the idea of someone content with little was curious. Everyone she knew wanted success.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;How long will he be here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Jackie shrugged and sipped her drink holding the glass so that it hid her expression. &amp;ldquo;Who knows? He&amp;#39;s between jobs and said he needs a few days to sort things out.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Jackie&amp;rsquo;s attempt to conceal her thoughts wasn&amp;rsquo;t lost on Gerald. Rudy smiled at Jackie. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s not too long. I imagine you can survive a few days.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
Jackie raised her sunglasses. &amp;ldquo;That all depends on him.&amp;rdquo;" />
