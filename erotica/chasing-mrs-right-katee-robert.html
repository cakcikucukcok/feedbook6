  <title>Chasing Mrs. Right - Katee Robert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Roxanne Stokes doesn&#39;t believe in love. She does, however, believe in the sexy-as-sin stranger who literally knocks her off her feet in front of a nightclub. The chemistry sparking between them takes her breath away, and she&#39;ll do anything to ease the pain in his eyes...until she realizes the handsome stranger is her best friend&#39;s older brother who&#39;s just come home from war.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ian Walser had no idea the gorgeous woman he slept with the night of his homecoming party was his little sister&#39;s best friend--or that she&#39;d be gone before morning. Roxanne&#39;s touch soothes him in a way nothing else can, and he&#39;s not ready to walk away from that yet. Not when spending time with her gave Ian a glimpse of everything he&#39;s ever wanted. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When his sister unwittingly pushes them together, he sees his chance. But convincing a woman who doesn&#39;t believe in love that she&#39;s his Mrs. Right might be harder than any mission Ian&#39;s undertaken. Good thing this soldier likes a challenge...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Each book in the Come Undone series is STANDALONE:&lt;br&gt;* Wrong Bed, Right Guy&lt;br&gt;* Chasing Mrs. Right&lt;br&gt;* Two Wrongs, One Right&lt;br&gt;* Seducing Mr. Right&lt;/p&gt;" />
