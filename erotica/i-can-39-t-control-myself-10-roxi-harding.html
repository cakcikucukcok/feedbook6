  <title>I Can&#39;t Control Myself #10 - Roxi Harding</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Will they or won&amp;#39;t they?&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;After living together for so long, you can&amp;#39;t blame these little brats and the princes of the house for wanting to experiment. But one thing leads to another, and before you know it they&amp;#39;re doing it for the first time, and it&amp;#39;s always hard and without protection!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;I&amp;#39;m waiting for you!&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~ PG Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;The green space of the college quad sits grand, majestic as John and his 18-year old stepsister Aubrey walk along it.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;I remember coming here when I was your age,&amp;quot; John says to his little sister. He looks around with nostalgic eyes. &amp;quot;Lot of good memories here.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Aubrey smiles up at her stepbrother, wondering where she can take him next.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Oh man, want to see the best spot on campus?&amp;quot; Aubrey asks her stepbrother.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;He smiles at her. &amp;quot;Um, obviously I do,&amp;quot; he says. Aubrey&amp;#39;s smile widens.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Come on,&amp;quot; she says, and the two of them head there.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Aubrey feels horny. She thinks about rubbing herself, but know that it won&amp;#39;t do the trick. This is a different type of horniness. It&amp;#39;s like a craving. And even though she&amp;#39;s a virgin, she knows what she&amp;#39;s craving.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;She&amp;#39;s craving her stepbrother, John.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Just a little higher,&amp;quot; Aubrey says a little while later, and soon enough she and her stepbrother walk out onto the dorm roof. If you go near the edge you can see out over the campus, but only a few steps back makes you invisible to those below.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Wow,&amp;quot; John says to his little sister. &amp;quot;And you say nobody else comes up here?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Nope,&amp;quot; Aubrey says with pride. &amp;quot;Nobody else seems to know how to get up here.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;John turns to look at his little sister and she smiles at him. He walks up to her, stopping right in front of her.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Oh,&amp;quot; John says when he looks at Aubrey&amp;#39;s face. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ve got an eyelash.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Oh,&amp;quot; Aubrey says. And then, &amp;quot;Would you get it for me?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;John, swallowing, reaches forward and lifts the tiny lash from his little sister&amp;#39;s smooth skin. They both look at it and then she puffs out her cheeks and blows it away.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Did you wish for something?&amp;quot; John asks, knowing what he would wish for.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; Aubrey says. She&amp;#39;s looking him right in the eyes now. &amp;quot;And I&amp;#39;m going to make it come true.&amp;quot;" />
