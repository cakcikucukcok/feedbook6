  <title>Mom&#39;s Morning After - Laura Lovecraft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Last night Paula went out intent on getting drunk and picking up a hot young stud. This morning Paula woke up with a hangover and no memory of what happened. But she&amp;#39;s not alone! There&amp;#39;s a warm hard body pressed against hers, and Paula is thrilled that she got what she wanted. Paula is in for the surprise of her life when she discovers the man in her bed, last night&amp;#39;s lover, is her son!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Enough!&amp;quot; DJ pushed her feet off his lap. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m your son, you shouldn&amp;#39;t be talking like a goddamn porn star to me.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Answer the question, DJ.&amp;quot; Mom didn&amp;#39;t seem upset by his yelling. &amp;quot;If that all happened what would you say about me? Would you think I was hot? Would you want to take me home and...&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Okay, okay!&amp;quot; DJ cut her off. &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re if you weren&amp;#39;t my mom, I&amp;#39;d be all over you!&amp;quot; He stopped himself from saying anymore because even that sounded way to awkward considering she was his mother.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Now was that so hard?&amp;quot; Mom&amp;#39;s eyes shifted and this time there was no doubt she was staring between his legs. &amp;quot;Hmm, not hard yet, but looks like we&amp;#39;re getting there.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Goodnight, mom.&amp;quot; DJ went to turn, but she leaned forward and caught his shorts again.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No goodnight kiss?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
DJ managed not to roll his eyes as he leaned over her and went to kiss her cheek. Mom caught the side of his face, and turning her head at the last second kissed him on the lips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Jeez!&amp;quot; DJ pulled back. &amp;quot;What was that?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A start,&amp;quot; she sighed. &amp;quot;Not much of one though. Let&amp;#39;s try again.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What the hell are you talking about?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mom rose to her feet and when she stepped towards him, he took a step back.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What I&amp;#39;m talking about is you&amp;#39;re the man of the house your job is to take care of me, right?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yeah,&amp;quot; he answered warily.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I need to be taken care of, DJ, and seeing you were the one that stopped that from happening I&amp;#39;ve decided you&amp;#39;re the one who is going to make it happen.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Funny, I&amp;#39;m the one who&amp;#39;s drunk, but you&amp;#39;re the one who can&amp;#39;t figure out the obvious.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She beckoned him with her finger. &amp;quot;Come over here.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He hesitated and she hissed angrily. &amp;quot;I said get over here!&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When he walked over to her, she put her hands on his shoulders, and turned him to the side. DJ allowed her too wondering what she was up to, then gasped in surprise when she gave him a shove.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His legs hit the back of the bed and he fell into a sitting position. Mom stepped up between his legs and smiled down at him. &amp;quot;You really don&amp;#39;t know what I want, DJ?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No, I...&amp;quot; he stopped when she put her finger to his lips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You, my good-looking man of the house, are going to satisfy me.&amp;quot;" />
