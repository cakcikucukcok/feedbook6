  <title>Incest On The Lake - A.J. Mayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;
Rylee loves her son, Troy, far more than she, should, and nearing forty, needs to man before she gets into deeper trouble. Fate leads her to a father, Adam, who&amp;rsquo;s having sex with his daughter, Brandi, and thinking the situation is perfect, Rylee decides to go after them. Spending time on Adam&amp;rsquo;s yacht, the two women take things to a new level with the incest constant and often.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
EXCERPT:&lt;br /&gt;
Rylee saw Brandi looking out over the calm lake, and eyeing her firm ass, wet her lips. &amp;ldquo;You have a killer body, sweetie.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Thanks, so do you, hot stuff. Lose the boys?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Adam&amp;rsquo;s showing Troy the engine compartment. They&amp;rsquo;ll be a few minutes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Good. We can talk, just us girls.&amp;rdquo; She handed Rylee a glass of orange juice. &amp;ldquo;We don&amp;rsquo;t have much time. Mind if I&amp;rsquo;m direct?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Please. I&amp;rsquo;d prefer it if you were.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Dad and I heard your screams while Troy fucked you last night. Is he really your son?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yep. We heard you too. Are you fucking your dad?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes. And I&amp;rsquo;m not going to stop.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t give up Troy either. Are you single?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Shit. You&amp;rsquo;re hoping to find a girl who&amp;rsquo;ll be okay with him fucking you.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t blame an insatiable mom for trying. Hope you&amp;rsquo;re not offended.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Nope.&amp;rdquo; Brandi ran fingers through her strands. &amp;ldquo;Could be the perfect situation. I&amp;rsquo;m single. Not counting dad, there are no men in my life.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Other than you, does Adam date any women?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Dad hasn&amp;rsquo;t dated at all since mom died.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m so sorry. Please, forgive me. Is the yacht named for her?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes. It&amp;rsquo;s okay. It&amp;rsquo;s been a little over two years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rylee reached over, squeezing Brandi&amp;rsquo;s hand. &amp;ldquo;I bet it was hard for you both.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;I mourned for a year, and when dad didn&amp;rsquo;t snap out of it, I went after him. Took me a long time, but I finally nailed him when we came to the lake.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Good for you. Your dad seems good now.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;He is. Are you single?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yep.&amp;rdquo; Rylee gazed into Brandi&amp;rsquo;s eyes and making a decision, her lips curled into a sly grin. &amp;ldquo;Maybe destiny put us together. I&amp;rsquo;m attracted to your dad.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Feel the same about your son. Troy&amp;rsquo;s hot. Let&amp;rsquo;s team up and share.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;They won&amp;rsquo;t know what hit &amp;lsquo;em.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Walking onto the deck, Adam said, &amp;ldquo;You women talking about Troy and me, baby girl?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yes, daddy. But only about what studs you two are.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Yeah, Adam. My new best friend and I were comparing notes.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Shit. I hope my daughter didn&amp;rsquo;t tell you about my perverted side.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Not yet, dreamboat.&amp;rdquo; Rylee winked. &amp;ldquo;But she will.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sitting on couches, they ate the fruit and sipped orange juice while talking for an hour. Adam drained his glass and looked at Troy. &amp;ldquo;Like to take a cruise? I enjoy watching women cock tease men.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Fuck, yeah. Mom loves showin&amp;rsquo; off.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Ooh. You&amp;rsquo;re a bad man, Adam... I like bad men.&amp;rdquo; Rylee grinned at Brandi. &amp;ldquo;Loan me a pair of heels, sweetie?&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;Follow me, hot stuff.&amp;rdquo;" />
