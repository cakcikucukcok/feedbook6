The Complete Billionaire Provider Series
Book 1 &quot;Playing Dress-Up&quot;
Book 2 &quot;Billionaire’s Booty&quot;
Book 3 &quot;Billionaire’s Heir&quot;
From Book 1: &quot;Playing Dress Up&quot;
I hung up the phone and plopped myself down on the couch with a feeling of defeat. It had always been just her and I. Sure she had suitors come and go, they were always nice and some even bought me gifts. However, not one had ever invaded our personal space, our relationship. That deep bond of woman and her daughter who struggled through life, just two against the world. But something…or better said, &quot;someone&quot;…has changed all that and I was left unprepared and not knowing how to handle this change in our lives.
She had met the best man in the world.
Richard was a very handsome older man, filthy rich, a billionaire. He was the complete package physically…always dressed in impeccably classy suits which complemented his chiseled physique...I would often catch myself staring dreamily at him.
I loved and respected her, yet was envious at the same time.
“When will I finally have my day? When will I be able to meet my Prince Charming? How could he not notice me?” I thought.
Or has he?
