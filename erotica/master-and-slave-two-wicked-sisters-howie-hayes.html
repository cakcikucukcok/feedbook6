  <title>Master and Slave: Two Wicked Sisters - Howie Hayes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Michael has a beautiful, loving wife at home, she&#39;s everything a man could want. So why does he keep coming back to the cruel woman he shamefully refers to as Mistress? He isn&#39;t free of her, even in his dreams. He tries again and again to rid himself of this painful need for his Mistress&#39; lash, her humiliation and most of all, the strap-on that she uses oh so well. He knows that he can&#39;t explain his lust and fascination with her to himself, let alone his wife. When his two worlds collide and he realizes that his wife knows far more than he imagines, he&#39;s caught between fantasy and reality. Will he be the husband that he longs to be or the slave he can&#39;t seem to stop being? Michael is about to discover that his Mistress truly holds all of the cards. This story contains BDSM, bondage, spanking and strap-on play. Names have been changed to protect the not-so-innocent. Get it Now and Enjoy!" />
