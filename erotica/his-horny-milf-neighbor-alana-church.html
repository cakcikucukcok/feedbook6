  <title>His Horny MILF Neighbor - Alana Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="When Jack&amp;#39;s sexy neighbor caught him peeping in her window, he thought his life was over. But Jillian Murphy is on the rebound from a bad marriage, and is on the prowl for some fresh young meat. Before he knows it, Jack is under the control of His Horny MILF Neighbor!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Um.&amp;quot; He swallowed. &amp;quot;I want to apologize. When I was upstairs yesterday, I opened the curtains because I hoped to see you naked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;You have every right to tell my parents, or call the cops, or whatever else you think is appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry,&amp;quot; he finished. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m really, really sorry, and I will never do anything like that again. Not to you or to any other woman.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After, a long moment, she blinked. &amp;quot;An apology. Well. Apparently you&amp;#39;re not a complete prick.&amp;quot; She paused, seemingly gathering her thoughts. &amp;quot;So, Jack.&amp;quot; Her tone was chilly. &amp;quot;Here&amp;#39;s the question. Were you spanking the monkey last night because you were seeing a naked woman? Or because I was naked?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jack didn&amp;#39;t need to think about it. &amp;quot;It was because of you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Oh? Do you think I&amp;#39;m beautiful?&amp;quot; He thought he could see something stirring in her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; he answered honestly. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think you&amp;#39;re beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I think you&amp;#39;re hot.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What? What are you talking about?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Lots of women are beautiful. Or want to be. And they&amp;#39;re going to spend the rest of their lives trying to hold onto the way they look right now. And the older they get, the harder they&amp;#39;ll try. Eventually, they&amp;#39;ll be nothing but makeup and liposuction and dye-jobs and botox. I&amp;#39;ve seen it with my mother&amp;#39;s friends. It looks like their faces will crack if they smile.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jillian&amp;#39;s lips twitched, and that gave him the courage to go on. &amp;quot;But you, Mrs. Murphy. You don&amp;#39;t seem to care. I mean, you look good. But you don&amp;#39;t have to work at it. You have this grace, this natural flow about you. You remind me of a tiger. Or a leopard.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Not a cougar?&amp;quot; Damn it, there was a smile playing around one corner of her mouth. For the first time, he felt himself relax slightly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Maybe. You&amp;#39;reyou&amp;#39;re just sexy, Jillian. I&amp;#39;ve thought so for years. And I wanted to see you. All of you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Hmm.&amp;quot; For a long moment, Jillian stared at him. She nodded once, abruptly. &amp;quot;All right. Apology accepted.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He felt his knees buckle. &amp;quot;Oh, thank God,&amp;quot; he said. He turned for the door. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sure you don&amp;#39;t want to see any more of me,&amp;quot; he said, realizing he was babbling, but unable to shut up. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll see you later.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He felt his shirt sleeve seized in an iron grip. &amp;quot;Oh, no you don&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Her face was lit by some unnameable emotion. &amp;quot;I said I accepted your apology. I didn&amp;#39;t say that I was done with you.&amp;nbsp;I. Own. Your. Ass.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;So here&amp;#39;s how it&amp;#39;s going to be, Jack. You can walk out of here. And sometime in the next couple of days, your entire comfortable little world is going to come tumbling down around your ears. Maybe it&amp;#39;s an anonymous phone call to the cops. Maybe it&amp;#39;s a letter in the mailbox. Maybe I show up on your front doorstep, and want to talk to your parents.&amp;nbsp;So unless you do what I want, I ruin you.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jack could almost feel the blood draining away from his face.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jillian stepped closer, so close he could almost feel the heat of her body. &amp;quot;Do you know,&amp;quot; she asked, one hand tracing patterns on his chest, &amp;quot;how long it&amp;#39;s been since I&amp;#39;ve been in bed with a man who found me attractive?&amp;quot;" />
