~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He made a sound in the front of his mouth that I realized was a chuckle. &amp;quot;Are you considered attractive among your people?&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I wouldn&amp;#39;t be here if I wasn&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
His ears twitched. He leaned lower to gaze into my eyes. &amp;quot;I cannot say that I find you attractive in the manner of my people,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;but I understand why you were chosen for this position. How do I describe this feeling? I find you...is the word &amp;#39;cute&amp;#39; appropriate?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I nodded. &amp;quot;There&amp;#39;s a few ways I can take that, most of them complimentary.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cautiously, Aurelias raised his upper left hand and swept his large fingers through my hair. &amp;quot;And you smell pleasant,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;Our females did not apply artificial scents.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But you have your pheromones.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; he said, &amp;quot;and they are effective. Still, I enjoy the smell of jasmine as much as the next creature.&amp;quot; His eyes moved over my body, curiosity tugging at the corners of his lips. &amp;quot;And this is part of human flirtation? The looks you were giving me in the meeting, the gentle pressure of your hand on my knee?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;What do you think?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All four of his wrists turned up, his palms to the sky. &amp;quot;I have another question. Was your job always as complicated as this?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Actually...&amp;quot; I reached for his chin and gently pulled it down to my eyes. &amp;quot;I was a teacher.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;How strange, and how fitting. A position that requires patience and a desire to impart knowledge. A nurturing instinct. The ability to work within an established system. Such traits are perfectly suited to a human emissary, but--&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;But it&amp;#39;s not the whole story,&amp;quot; I said. I slid my palms up his long jaw, enjoying the sleekness of his sea foam skin. I pulled him lower, down to me, and planted a soft kiss on his lips.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Aurelias reared back, astonished. &amp;quot;Was that a kiss?&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A very chaste one,&amp;quot; I said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Hisanian licked his lips. &amp;quot;I confess that I find myself more attracted to you the more you speak, or perhaps I am simply eager to begin this strange act.&amp;quot; He seemed puzzled by his own impatience. &amp;quot;Forgive me,&amp;quot; he said, after a moment. &amp;quot;I have not copulated since my wife was taken by the plague. I had thought my will more than adequate to restrain me but...you are extremely fertile.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Your wife, how long ago did it happen?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;The same time it struck all our females. They went quickly, which is our only solace.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m sorry,&amp;quot; I said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He cocked his head. &amp;quot;Why?&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I shrugged. &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s what we say. It&amp;#39;s a brief way of showing respect for your loss.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;That is kind,&amp;quot; he said. &amp;quot;I do not know what she would think of this state of affairs. We are a proud race and do not easily change. She was...traditional.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m not,&amp;quot; I said." />
