  <title>Cate: A Caregiver Providing Real Care - Part 2 - Elizabeth Thorn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Cate, a caregiver, learns a very new definition of taking care of a patient. One that she has to balance with the moral obligations that she has as a married woman.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Slowly but steadily she reaches the point of no return. How will her husband respond once he finds out what she&amp;#39;s been doing on the job?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The conclusion of a tale where romance and lust are intertwined.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~ Excerpt ~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly her heart started pounding in her chest, a wave of shame flooded her just as only moments ago her orgasm had, and she hurriedly left the bathroom. Leaving Abel behind as he called out to her, ignoring him completely as she fled to the safety of the privacy of his bedroom. Alone! I have to be alone, a little voice inside her head screamed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Slamming the door of the bedroom shut with a bang, she rested her back against it for a moment as she tried to calm herself down, tears of shame running down her cheeks. After a few minutes, she finally found the strength to open her eyes. Still crying, she moved in front of the mirror. God, how could I have been so stupid, she thought as she observed her appearance in the mirror. Like a bitch in heat she had allowed her hormones to take the lead, and look where it had got her! Dressed like a whore, her still hard nipples barely covered by a small piece of fabric that no one in their right mind would wear! The same could be said for the ridiculous piece of fabric that barely covered her pussy! What had she been thinking when she thought it was a good idea to put on that thong and parade it in front of a client!! A client!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Exhausted and ashamed, Cate sat down at the end of the bed and covered her face with her hands. No one could ever know and she would have to stop working for Abel. Pull yourself together woman, she sternly told herself as she forced herself to sit up straight. Taking several deep breaths, she harnessed herself emotionally to face Abel, tell him of her decision, and offer him her sincere apology for her wanton behavior!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
With a fair degree of self-disgust she stripped herself with her back to the mirror, and put on her clothes; she much preferred to get them wet as she helped Abel out of the shower than to show herself off in that outfit for another moment. Just before opening the bedroom door, she took another deep breath to summon her courage and then opened the door. Her head hung low in shame, she went straight to the bathroom, even though her heart would have preferred to make a run for the front door." />
