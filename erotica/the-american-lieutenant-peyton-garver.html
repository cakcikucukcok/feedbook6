  <title>The American Lieutenant - Peyton Garver</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lieutenant Garrett Harkins, a US paratrooper stationed in Wiltshire, England during World War 2, leads his platoon through the largest airborne operations of the war: Normandy, Netherlands, and Belgium. Between campaigns, Garrett defies orders when he pursues a forbidden romance with Sophia, a young British heiress. While deployed and fighting in Europe, Garrett struggles with fear, morality, and guilt. He draws strength from believing that Sophia reciprocates his feelings and awaits his safe return. 
Sophia Wells is fighting her own war. She became interested in the American lieutenant while struggling over the end of a childhood infatuation with James, a young British officer who has finally come to realize he does indeed reciprocate her feelings, and wants her back in his arms. 
Will the bond between the American Lieutenant and his newfound love survive the tragedies of war and a former love, or become a casualty of both?" />
