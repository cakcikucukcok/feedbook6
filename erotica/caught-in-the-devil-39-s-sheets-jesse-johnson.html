  <title>Caught in the Devil&#39;s Sheets - Jesse Johnson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Delilah Winter always had an unhealthy obsession with bad boys. It seemed like she attracted them along with a whole mess of trouble. It was no surprise when she fell in love with Jaime, a member of Santa Monicas most notorious biker gang the Devils Bandits. He introduced her to the world of drug trafficking, making the kind of money shed only ever dreamed about.
	Soon her dream has become a nightmare. Jaime becomes violently addicted to the drugs they sell, and she falls victim to his rage. He has a run in with the law, and just before he goes to jail, he gets mixed up with a rival gang, leaving Lila to constantly watching her back.
Most women would leave, but Lila isnt most women. She didnt just fall in love with the man, she fell in love with the thrill of being an outlaw. She stays strong, and has no choice but to partner up with Odin in order to continue doing the Devils work.
	She soon finds a companion in Odin, despite all the warning she receives about him. Even Odin admits that there is something dark and twisted about his past, and the role he played in it. Lila chooses to ignore the red flags, or maybe theyre part of the attraction. She finds herself helplessly caught up in the man behind the perfect smile and the devilish blue eyes!" />
