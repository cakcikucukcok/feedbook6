      <meta name="description" content="Welcome to Peoples Anonymous. Herein lies one of the most profound spiritual healing
recipes ever entrusted to the human race. This Twelve-Step technology has the capacity
to heal your life beyond anything you may have previously imagined. 
By applying the Twelve Steps to your life, you will:
 Rediscover your authentic self;
 Clear away the wreckage of your past;
 Enjoy a new sense of freedom and purpose;
 Begin to live more fully in the present;
 Awaken to a life of joy, service and moments of bliss.
Millions are currently living happy, joyous, and free by simply applying this program to their daily lives. We consider the twelve-step recipe outlined in this book to be the spiritual alchemy of the 21st Century. It transforms the lives of those, who are willing to follow the directions
precisely, into gold.
 Finally, a users manual for the human race. Peoples Anonymous provides a 12 Step
approach to life and recovery (from all kinds of conditions) that is accessible to everyone.
In fact, its better to use the Peoples Anonymous Big Book if youve never had an addiction.
What you will discover is a deeper understanding of how to connect your authentic values
with your actions. Which makes for a healthier life. Pick it up and start reading it. Now.
Dr. Bruce F. Singer, Psy.D.
Peoples Anonymous has finally brought the beautiful 12 Step way of life and healing
Power to the rest of the world.
