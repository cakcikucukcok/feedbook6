  <title>Character and Opinion in the United States, with Reminiscences of William James and Josiah Royce and Academic Life in America - George Santayana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This volume contains a collection of articles on the nature of America and of being American, composed from lectures originally addressed to British audiences by George Santayana. This fascinating collection, first published in 1921, will appeal to those with an interest in the development of America and its philosophy, and is not to be missed by fans and collectors of Santayana&#39;s work. The chapters of this book include: &quot;The Moral Background&quot;, &quot;The Academic Environment&quot;, &quot;William James&quot;, &quot;Josiah Royce&quot;, &quot;Later Speculations&quot;, &quot;Materialism and Idealism in American Life&quot;, and &quot;English Liberty in America&quot;. George Santayana (1863 - 1952) was an influential philosopher, essayist, poet, and novelist. He was brought up in the United States and called himself an American, despite the fact that he always made sure that he had a valid Spanish passport. Many vintage texts such as this are increasingly scarce and expensive, and it is with this in mind that we are republishing this book now, in an affordable, high-quality, modern edition. It comes complete with a specially commissioned biography of the author." />
