  <title>Saint Thomas Aquinas - 50Minutes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Keen to learn but short on time? Get to grips with the life of Saint Thomas Aquinas in next to no time with this concise guide.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;50Minutes.com provides a clear and engaging analysis of the life, work and ideas of the medieval philosopher Thomas Aquinas. Unlike many of his influential predecessors, Aquinas believed that reason and faith are not separate and incompatible, but rather are two ways of attaining knowledge of God. He was a prolific commentator on the Bible and the writings of Aristotle, and some of his works, including in particular his masterpiece the &lt;i&gt;Summa theologiae&lt;/i&gt;, continue to form the basis of Catholic doctrine over 700 years after his death. In many ways, Aquinas was far ahead of his time: his views on personal and political morality emphasised the importance of individual freedom, and even paved the way for later democratic and secular ideas. He was canonised in 1323 and made a Doctor of the Church in 1567.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;In just 50 minutes you will:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;oLearn about the intellectual context in which Aquinas was working and the earlier philosophers who influenced his writings&lt;br&gt;oDiscover Aquinas&#39;s main works, including the &lt;i&gt;Summa theologiae&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Summa contra gentiles&lt;/i&gt;, and the key ideas of Thomist thought&lt;br&gt;oUnderstand the continuing influence of Aquinas&#39;s work within the Catholic Church&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;ABOUT 50MINUTES.COM | History &amp; Culture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;50MINUTES.COM will enable you to quickly understand the main events, people, conflicts and discoveries from world history that have shaped the world we live in today.
