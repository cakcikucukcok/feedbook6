  <title>The Winning Mind - Reindorf O. Bempah</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Do you really want to succeed in life?
	Do you earnestly Desire success?
	Do you think and imagine the future to be GREAT and AWESOME?
Research has proven that the Mind controls about 80% of the bodily activities. Many are those who wish to be successful in life, in health and to raise their businesses to a world- class level. Reindorf has experienced hardship growing up as a child with his divorced mother and yet, he rose from what seemed a hopeless life into a place of greatness, through faith and the application of the principles in this book.
 Reindorf O. Bempah has identified seven things this book will do for you. These include:
Get you out of Problem thinking into Problem solving.
Help you to lay hold of your desired future.
Help you change from a bitter person to become a better person.
Help you to see challenges with a new perspective.
Make you to stop thinking as a victim and start thinking as a victor.
Increase your desire for Greatness.
Help you to develop a winning attitude no matter the challenge you find yourself in.
I have known Reindorf O. Bempah initially as a student for four years and now a work colleague for quite a long time now. He is very passionate about things he does. This book he has put together is very great as I must confess that though I taught him some of the concepts he used in writing this book, reading it in his version, gave me a special re-awakening! I do recommend this book THE WINNING MIND to everyone as it will bring out something in you that you may not have known existed.
-Aku Hayfron (Mrs), Clinical Psychologist &amp; Lecturer, Central University College. 
This book challenges the reader to dig deep into themselves and explore their potential to the fullest. Anyone who wishes to coin their own destiny needs to meditate deeply on the words of wisdom and share the message. This book gives hope to the hopeless and speech to the speechless. I recommend it to every avid reader" />
