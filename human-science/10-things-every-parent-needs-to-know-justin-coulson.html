  <title>10 Things Every Parent Needs to Know - Justin Coulson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="From the popular author of 21 Days to a Happier Family and 9 Ways to a Resilient Child, this book is a moving, inspiring and loving call to action for all parents.   Parenting expert Dr Justin Coulson shares the ten things every parent needs to know to raise their children in positive ways. They are also ways to make parenting easier for you - so you don&#39;t have to keep &#39;making it up as you go along&#39;. Drawing on positive psychology, the book gives simple and effective strategies for the main issues parents of 2-12 year olds confront in everyday family life. Justin shares his secrets of effective attention, communication and understanding; how to discipline effectively and set limits; and how to manage hot-button issues such as sibling conflict, chores, school and screens - yet still have fun as a family. Praise for Dr Justin Coulson &#39;Justin is a genius! His honest, compassionate and sensible advice is music to this mum&#39;s ears. I want him to adopt our family!&#39; - Jessica Rowe, co-host, Studio 10 &#39;Dr Justin Coulson is who I turn to when I&#39;m feeling overwhelmed with parenting my three young (and frequently boisterous) kids. His calm, logical advice never fails to help me be a better parent.&#39; - Bec Sparrow, author of Find Your Tribe &#39;If your aim is to be the best parent you possibly can, this is your go-to book.&#39; - Madonna King, author of Being 14 &#39;A wonderfully practical book that&#39;s bulging with heart, soul and wisdom. It&#39;s a book I&#39;ll definitely be recommending to my children, who are now parents themselves.&#39; - Michael Grose, parenting expert and founder of Parenting Ideas" />
