  <title>Unafraid, Unfrazzled &amp; Unfrogettable: Discover Your Authentic Inner Voice and Go from Tongue-Tied to Terrific! - Leila Witkin, Barbara Eubanks</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A Practical Guide to Overcoming Stage Fright and the Fear of Public Speaking.  Jerry Seinfeld: &#39;According to most studies, people&#39;s number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two. Does that seem right? That means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you&#39;re better off in the casket than doing the eulogy!  If what the American comedian says is true (and there are numerous polls to support his observation), millions of people would actually rather face death than speak in public. If you are one of those people, you have come to the right place for help!" />
