  <title>Political Straight Talk - H. John Lyke, Kathryn L. Robyn</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In writing the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, our Founding Fathers established a democratic republic with a solid political basis.
What they wrote was the political map that future representatives would need to follow to conduct the people&#39;s business in an efficient and effective manner. As long as they faithfully carried out the people&#39;s will, our democracy and republic would function in a way congruent with our forebears&#39; wishes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What in the world happened?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;H. John Lyke, a board-certified psychologist and professor emeritus at Metropolitan State College of Denver, and the author of multiple political psychology books, suggests that ever since George Washington retired as captain of our ship of state, subsequent presidents and members of Congress have failed to use the sailing chart of the Constitution. Instead, they&#39;ve chosen to pursue their own and their political parties&#39; self-interests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Lyke uses psychological principles to explore the reasons why our government has fallen so low, and in the voice of a kind but determined therapist, he offers simple and viable solutions to get us back to following our map.&lt;/p&gt;" />
