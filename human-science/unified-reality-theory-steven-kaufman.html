  <title>Unified Reality Theory - Steven Kaufman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Unified Reality Theory demonstrates that the source of reality is a universal consciousness, and that we are in no way separable from that source, and so in no way truly separable from each other or any other aspect of reality. I recommend this book to anyone interested in understanding the nature of reality and their place in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deepak Chopra&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unified Reality Theory describes how all reality evolves from an absolute existence. It also demonstrates that this absolute existence must have consciousness as an attribute thats intrinsic to its being. Thus, Unified Reality Theory shows that consciousness, rather than being a product of the evolution of physical reality, is itself the source of what we experience as physical reality, and that physical reality is itself but one aspect of an evolving universal consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unified Reality Theory shows that, most fundamentally, this absolute consciousness-existence evolves into reality by means of a single process: self-relation. That is, consciousness-existence becomes reality by forming relationships with itself, analogous in a very limited way to what happens to a rubber band thats twisted upon itself, i.e., it remains whole while differentiating into other forms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, Unified Reality Theory demonstrates that reality is a state of existential self-relation. The idea that the universe consists of existence which has formed relationships with itself isnt new; Taoists have understood this idea for at least a couple of thousand years. Whats new here is the presentation of this idea in the form of a detailed and defined structural model that correlates with the behavior of physical reality as described by science in general and physics in particular. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Unified Reality Theory uses science and logic to make the case that God exists, as a pervasive and absolute consciousness that transcends the realities of space and time, and that we, as well as everything else, are that!&lt;/p&gt;" />
