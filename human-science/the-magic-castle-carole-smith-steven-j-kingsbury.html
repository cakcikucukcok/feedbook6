  <title>The Magic Castle - Carole Smith, Steven J. Kingsbury</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Alex Smith and his eight personalities were trapped in a world of unfathomable evil...until he entered the &quot;magic castle&quot; and found the key to his freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Carole Smith and her husband decided to take in a foster child that no one else would have, they knew ten-year-old Alex would be difficult. But nothing had prepared them for the unruly, self-destructive boy who stormed into their lives. Alone with Alex during the day, Carole was baffled by his infantile tantrums and violent, self-hating behaviors. Exasperated, she tried relating to him as the two-year-old he appeared to be, and finally, a door to Alex&#39;s mind began to open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the help of psychiatrist Dr. Steven Kingsbury, Alex&#39;s tormented mind revealed a host of personalities, each born in a horrifying episode of Alex&#39;s past-- each carrying a memory too powerful for his conscious mind to handle. As the personalities came forth in the safety of Alex&#39;s inner, secret castle, they unleashed stories of abandonment, brainwashing, and sexual abuse by those Alex trusted the most. In &lt;i&gt;The Magic Castle&lt;/i&gt;, here is a fascinating true story of the human mind; of innocence shattered by inhuman cruelty; and ultimately of love&#39;s power to transform fragments into wholeness-- tragedy into triumph.&lt;/p&gt;" />
