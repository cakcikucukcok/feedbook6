  <title>Exit - Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From a renowned sociologist, the wisdom of saying goodbye&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Sara Lawrence-Lightfoot is enthralled by exits: long farewells, quick goodbyes, sudden endings, the ordinary and the extraordinary. There&#39;s a relationship, she attests, between small goodbyes and our ability &quot;to master and mark the larger farewells.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Exit&lt;/i&gt;, her tenth book, she explores the ways we leave one thing and move on to the next; how we anticipate, define, and reflect on our departures; our epiphanies that something is over and done with. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawrence-Lightfoot, a sociologist and a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, has interviewed more than a dozen women and men in states of major change, and she paints their portraits with sympathy and insight: a gay man who finds home and wholeness after coming out; a sixteen-year-old boy forced to leave Iran in the midst of the violent civil war; a Catholic priest who leaves the church he has always been devoted to, he life he has loved, and the work that has been deeply fulfilling; an anthropologist who carefully stages her departure from he &quot;field&quot; after four years of research; and many more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Too often, Lawrence-Lightfoot believes, we exalt new beginnings at the expense of learning from our goodbyes. &lt;i&gt;Exit&lt;/i&gt; finds wisdom and perspective in the possibility of moving on and marks the start of a new conversation, to help us discover how we might make our exits with purpose and dignity.&lt;/p&gt;" />
