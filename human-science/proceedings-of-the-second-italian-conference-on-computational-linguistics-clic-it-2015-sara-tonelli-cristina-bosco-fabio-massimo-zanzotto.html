  <title>Proceedings of the Second Italian Conference on Computational Linguistics CLiC-it 2015 - Sara Tonelli, Cristina Bosco, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;CLiC-it 2015 is held in Trento on December 3-4 2015, hosted and locally organized by Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK), one the most important Italian research centers for what concerns CL. The organization of the conference is the result of a fruitful conjoint effort of different research groups (Università di Torino, Università di Roma Tor Vergata and FBK) showing the nationwide spreading of CL in Italy. As in the first edition, the main aim of the event is at establishing a reference forum on CL, covering all the aspects needed to describe the multi-faceted and cross-disciplinary reality of the involved research topics and of the Italian community working in this area. Indeed the spirit of CLiC-it is inclusive, in order to build a scenario as much as possible comprehensive of the complexity of language phenomena and approaches to address them, bringing together researchers and scholars with different competences and skills and working on different aspects according to different perspectives. The large number of researchers that have decided to present their work at CLiC-it and the number of directions here investigated are proof of the maturity of our community and a promising indication of its vitality. We received a total of 64 paper submissions, out of which 52 have been accepted to appear in the Conference Proceedings, which are available online and on the OpenEdition platform. Overall, we collected 129 authors from 15 countries.&lt;/p&gt;" />
