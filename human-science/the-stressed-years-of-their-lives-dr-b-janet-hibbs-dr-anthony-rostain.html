  <title>The Stressed Years of Their Lives - Dr. B. Janet Hibbs, Dr. Anthony Rostain</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;From two leading child and adolescent mental health experts comes a guide for the parents of every college and college-bound student who want to know what&#39;s normal mental health and behavior, what&#39;s not, and how to intervene before it&#39;s too late. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;The title says it all...Chock full of practical tools, resources and the wisdom that comes with years of experience, &lt;i&gt;The Stressed Years of their Lives&lt;/i&gt; is destined to become a well-thumbed handbook to help families cope with this modern age of anxiety.&quot; --&lt;b&gt;Brigid Schulte, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, author of &lt;i&gt;Overwhelmed&lt;/i&gt; and director of the Better Life Lab at New America&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All parenting is in preparation for letting go. However, the paradox of parenting is that the more we learn about late adolescent development and risk, the more frightened we become for our children, and the more we want to stay involved in their lives. This becomes particularly necessary, and also particularly challenging, in mid- to late adolescence, the years just before and after students head off to college. These years coincide with the emergence of many mood disorders and other mental health issues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When family psychologist Dr. B. Janet Hibbs&#39;s own son came home from college mired in a dangerous depressive spiral, she turned to Dr. Anthony Rostain. Dr. Rostain has a secret superpower: he understands the arcane rules governing privacy and parental involvement in students&#39; mental health care on college campuses, the same rules that sometimes hold parents back from getting good care for their kids. Now, these two doctors have combined their expertise to corral the crucial emotional skills and lessons that every parent and student can learn for a successful launch from home to college.&lt;/p&gt;" />
