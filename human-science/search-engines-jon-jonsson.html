  <title>Search Engines - Jon Jonsson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book is written for you if you want to comprehend your present life, and your possible future prospects.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Search Engines takes you on an intense journey throughout your complete life span. From the very beginning you have moved through the sperm- and egg-bodies, to the fetus-body and then into the human-body. On that journey, you have already experienced some deaths and rebirths. The book reveals a strong pattern that runs through these phases of life. Furthermore, it highlights how this same pattern is repeated once again, in classical spiritual texts, which describe the afterlife. By knowing this pattern in your own &amp;quot;creation story&amp;quot;, you can picture your future beyond death in a surprisingly hopeful light. For most ordinary people, a spiritual-search is like a mystical maze. This book gives you a sharp overview, which helps to connect the dots in your life. The narrative presents a novel way to look at life and death. The writing style is aimed at 21st century readers, so the concepts are clear and easy to relate to." />
