  <title>Forbidden Places Strange Faces - Gavin Moles</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The Author has a unique, artistic and romantic mind, with a special way of seeing and describing the world, and this time a very special way of travelling, with no plan, no map, no idea, therefore thinking what could possibly go wrong? He describes a journey he took through parts of Asia on a small budget fuelled with big dreams, following instincts and longing to find the legendary Shangrilla, timeless valleys, and revelations for inner growth. With Chorma&#39;s smile still warm in his heart, he sets off walking down a forbidden road through Tibet, hoping to reach Lhasa. The travel Gods answered his prayers as they often do when you ask, but he forgot to say exactly how he wished to get there! His writing style and artistic imagination will take you spiralling down infinite thoughts, hillarious situations and potential oblivion, sometimes floating, sometimes soaring, but always eventually appearing in wonderland drinking tea with the mad hatter himself. You will not want to put it down, just like travelling, eager to see what is just around the next corner?" />
