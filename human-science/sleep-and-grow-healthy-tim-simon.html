  <title>Sleep and Grow Healthy - Tim Simon</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Are you struggling with your weight? Your moods? Your motivation? Is life just not quite the picture of balance and bliss you wish it could be?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re finally waking up to the importance of sleep. The latest research shows just how vital a role quality sleep plays in protecting against diseases, stabilising mental and emotional health, regulating weight, enhancing productivity and creativity, and even making us more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet almost three-quarters of Australian adults are struggling with chronic sleep deprivation, and with it, a host of physical, emotional and mental problems that are making life less than optimal. Author Tim Simon was one of the casualties &amp;ndash; until a time of crisis brought on a sleep epiphany and started him back on the path to a healthy and fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Tim is on a mission to share his sleep-centric approach to wellbeing. Drawing on expertise from health professionals and Tim&amp;rsquo;s own industry and personal experience, Sleep and Grow Healthy exposes the issues behind the modern sleep-debt crisis, reveals why sleep is the key to thinking, working, moving, eating and loving well, and shows you how to get the sleep you need to live the life you truly desire.&lt;/p&gt;" />
