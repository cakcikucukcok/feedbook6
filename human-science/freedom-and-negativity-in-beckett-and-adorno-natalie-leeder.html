  <title>Freedom and Negativity in Beckett and Adorno - Natalie Leeder</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Since his notorious 1961 lecture, &amp;#39;Trying to Understand &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Endgame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#39;, Theodor W. Adorno&amp;#39;s name has been frequently coupled with that of Samuel Beckett. This book offers a radical reappraisal of the intellectual affinities between these two figures, whose paths crossed all too fleetingly. Specifically the book argues for a preoccupation with the concept of freedom in Beckett&amp;#39;s works - one which situates him as a profoundly radical and even political writer. Adorno&amp;#39;s own more explicit reconceptualization of freedom and its scarcity in modernity offers a unique lens through which to examine the way Beckett&amp;#39;s works preserve a minimal space of freedom that acts in opposition to an unfree social totality. While acknowledging both the biographical encounters between Adorno and Beckett and the influence Beckett&amp;#39;s writings had on Adorno&amp;#39;s aesthetics, Natalie Leeder goes further to establish a dialogue between their intellectual positions, working with a range of texts from both writers and seeking insight in Adorno&amp;#39;s less familiar works, as well as his magnum opera, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Aesthetic Theory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; and &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Negative Dialectics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
