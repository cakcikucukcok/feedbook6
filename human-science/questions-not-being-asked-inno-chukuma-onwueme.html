  <title>Questions Not Being Asked - Inno Chukuma Onwueme</title>
      <meta name="description" content="*5-star designation from reviewer Tracy Fischer (for READERS FAVORITE) 
*Highly Positive review from US REVIEW OF BOOKS (Peter Fitzpatrick)
*5-Star designation from reviewer Gisela Dixon (for Readers Favorite). 
What do you do when profound thoughts stealthily tip-toe across the backyard of your mind? You capture them, refine them, and make them your own. The philosophical accretions of these thoughts are what Dr. Inno Onwueme now shares with you in this intellectually stimulating book. Using erudite essays, poems, and aphorisms, he explores a wide range of burning topical topics, including the philosophical (e.g. Silence has spoken), religious (Death, orgasm, and God), sociological (The civil union debate), environmental (Affluenza), cultural (Mother-tongue needs mothering), political (Anioma identity), war/peace, and even the humorous. And then theres the incendiary nine-part epic poem, Unasked questions driving the American ethos, which is seismic, sarcastic, and sure to provoke. Revel in this rich universe of radical thought, as Questions Not Being Asked pushes you to find new ways of asking questions that youve never before asked, while finding new answers to ancient questions. Grab this opportunity to take your philosophical thinking on everyday topics to a higher plane. Youll then be ready to ask Questions Not Being Asked." />
