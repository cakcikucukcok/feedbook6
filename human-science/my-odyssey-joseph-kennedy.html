  <title>My Odyssey - Joseph Kennedy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;My Odyssey: Stories, Poems, and Verse&lt;/i&gt; began simply with a high school classroom assignment to write a short story. Author Joseph Kennedy had no idea what to write; he was prepared to fail instantly. Ultimately, however, he succeededso much so that his short story was published in his high schools collection of writings for that year. Thus began his interest in writing as a way to chronicle his thoughts and ideas. 
This collection is organized chronologically, following the growth of his creative voice as it develops through his odyssey. His growth, change, and adaptation are both obvious and subtlefrom the sad Elegy to Mama Cass to the quiet elegance of a January thunderstorm in January Noon, his voice resonates with strength and vibrancy.
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elegy to Mama Cass&lt;/b&gt;
This morning I am mourning the death of Cass Elliot
Who died choking on a ham sandwich,
An Epicurean delight; she excelled in the art of eating.
Now by her own hand, the maid, goodly stuffed,
Lies still with a smile beamin
As the cortege intones strains of California Dreamin.
John, Michelle, Denny, all who earned a penny
With her on Creeque Alley now wish her bon voyage
And happiness to deaths rally.&lt;/i&gt;" />
