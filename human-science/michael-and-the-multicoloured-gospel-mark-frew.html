  <title>Michael and the Multicoloured Gospel - Mark Frew</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Michael Farril is born in the outer western suburbs of Sydney into a good, Protestant, Bible-believing family. He is a good boy and a model of what a good Christian should be. But Michael has a secret - he is gay.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael believes that he cannot be both a Christian and a homosexual and so his quest is to find a cure for his homosexuality. During his search, he meets different people along the way who create a great impact on his thinking: Ruth, his Catholic girlfriend at school, Troy, a classmate who Michael falls in love with, Joseph, a Jewish friend from university, Rosemary, a friend from Michael&amp;#39;s church who later becomes a Mormon, and Markus, a workmate and for a time Michael&amp;#39;s lover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During his quest, Michael learns the original languages of the Bible and tries to understand this book within its historical setting. This leads Michael to unwittingly stumble across literature predating the New Testament which not only greatly influenced the formation of the Bible but was inspired by a great historical figure who, like Michael, was gay. This leads Michael to a new revelation which beautifully units his sexuality and spirituality to form his own, personal multicoloured gospel.&lt;/p&gt;" />
