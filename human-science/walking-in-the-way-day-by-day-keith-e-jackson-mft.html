  <title>Walking in the Way Day by Day - Keith E. Jackson Mft</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;This book was written as a result of questions I had concerning the state of the church of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I read of all the miracles God performed in the Bible, and like Gideon (Judges 6:13) I asked the question, Where has that God gone? Why am I not seeing that kind of power in my life? After much prayer and meditation, God started to show me what was lacking in my life. I realized that walking with God was more than just memorizing Scriptures and learning formulas to get God to work on my behalf.&lt;br /&gt;
While I was paralyzed from a spinal infection, I realized that some of what I had been taught in church were based on tradition and were not biblically based. During this period of time, God began the healing process. Through faith in the Word of God, I was healed physically, but, more importantly, God gave me the assignment to pass on to others what I have learned. I pray for all those who read this book: may your eyes and hearts be open to receive the message of Gods great love for you and His desire to lead you to your Promise Land.&lt;/p&gt;" />
