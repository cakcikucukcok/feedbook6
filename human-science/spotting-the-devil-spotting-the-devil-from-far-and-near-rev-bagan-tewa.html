  <title>Spotting the Devil Spotting the Devil from Far and Near - Rev. Bagan Tewa</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Spotting The Devil/Spotting The Devil From Far and Near.
Avoiding The Trap Of Negative Behavior In Order To Fulfill The Purpose Of Ones Life.
The word devil in this book is not used in the traditional sense.  The word devil conjures up a powerful image of everything that is negative and destructive and it is in this sense that the word is used.  We are surrounded by it.  In many ways we are consumed by it, yet man is afraid to utter the word, as if by saying the word devil man is somehow admitting that he is accepting of this taboo and is in aggreance with the devil force. This book says that we must and can learn to identify all these negatives as they come at us in order to avoid the dire consequences that come about as a result of our contact with these devils in our society.
This book seeks to examine the world in which we live with an analytical approach to why we as the human race make the choices in life that we do.  It starts with a simple story about an incident that happens in the authors childhood, with the intention of explaining why the author sees things the way he does and coming to the realization that this was a defining moment in his life, even though he did not know it at the time.  This book looks at fear, the fear that is an obstacle to most of us and this fear is something we take for granted, Most of us think that this fear is normal and that there is no way around it.  Not true, as the author explains.  He goes into the reasons why we must conquer these fears and where most of these fears originate. 
	The author goes on to explain friendship and how we are so easily lulled into different behavior, how easy it is for us to get caught up in the moment and how easily it is to get carried away, usually to our detriment.  In using stories from his life experience he takes the reader on a journey and in every step of that journey he unfolds a secret.  There is so much that we take for granted and yet so much of this behavior can be prevented if we could only recognize what is coming at us, just like the driver who knows he is about to collide with another car because he sees it coming towards him from the opposite direction.  	
	The author looks at popular culture from the inside out and shows us how we are surrounded by so much negativity yet we dont know it because we do not look  at society from this angle.  We can have a greater appreciation for the images that are fed to us if we see them for what they are, and we can watch and enjoy without becoming consumed by fantasy if we understand the motives behind what is being fed to us.  	
In these times, it is crucial that we learn from the mistakes of the past and we challenge ourselves to be more disciplined and to develop our sense of foresight because we all have the gift.  We are born with it, but as we grow we allow societys ills to get the better of us and we just follow rather than lead ourselves into a better life, where we can find the fulfillment that we all seek. This book looks at first, the microcosm, and then the macrocosm, taking a peek at wars and what is the lesson of these wars.  
	The author also looks at religion and mans attitude towards it.  Why do we get caught up in imagery and names and not listen to what is truth and what makes sense.  We follow, even when two plus two does not make four, we follow blindly and again are led downstream.  
Finally the author looks at colors that have been in cultures for thousands of years and unravels the associations that many have come to attach to certain colors.  
	This book is an eye opener, written in a simple language that would only serve to enlighten and unravel some of the mysteries that make life so complex.  The key is right in front of us.
