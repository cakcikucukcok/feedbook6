  <title>J&#39;APE: Just Another Publicity Excuse - How to Publish Your (Kindle) Book for Shameless Self-Promotion and Profit - Dr. Robert C. Worstell</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;The Secret to Self-Publishing on Amazon is said to be: &amp;quot;&amp;quot;You Need to First Be A Celebrity To Succeed At Anything&amp;quot;&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This parody is a sarcastic look at how you can be an &amp;quot;&amp;quot;overnight&amp;quot;&amp;quot; success - by making it impossible for anyone else to succeed as you set the bar astronomically high.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Learn the 3 Parts to Real eBook Publishing&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How to write a book - real quick, shallow, ghost-written.&lt;br /&gt;
How to publish your book - hire someone to do it for cheap, like putting their name on the cover.&lt;br /&gt;
How to sell a book online - using your devoted, Kool-Aid-drinking fan-base to suck-up and give you fake 5-star reviews without having read the book.&lt;br /&gt;
Obviously, this is a work of satire and has nothing to do with the real world. And any resemblance to a currently successful bestseller is just a happy coincidence. (Right.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Solve the Key Factors Which Have Kept You From Publishing Your Book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your life is out of Control because you didn&amp;#39;t devote yourself to learning celebrity-skills.&lt;br /&gt;
You want to get Approval for everything you do - but that&amp;#39;s just the half of it. Find how celebrities can&amp;#39;t live without it, so self-publishing puts &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Vanity&amp;quot;&amp;quot; back into the name.&lt;br /&gt;
You want to have the Security, but really you need to stick to that day job and leave all the PR to PR Artistes who appear on late night info-mercials to sell over-priced junk.&lt;br /&gt;
And you want to Join the group of successful Independent Authors, but except for a few cheaters who stumble into it by accident, the system is rigged to sell only celebrity&amp;#39;s books (and cute dressed-up-cat-picture books).&lt;br /&gt;
Tools you will find inside this guide:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How to wreck your life and get fired for spending too much time on your book, then falling asleep at work - repeatedly.&lt;br /&gt;
How to ruin your family relationships by getting every relative you know to loan you money and/or write suck-up reviews of your book (and like, and plus, and tweet about it to their friends.)&lt;br /&gt;
Lose any certainty you ever had about how good you are as a writer, because some celebrity comes along with their version of how it &amp;quot;&amp;quot;really&amp;quot;&amp;quot; works, so no one listens to your advice ever again.&lt;br /&gt;
Discover how a celebrity can suck the air out of a room by just showing up, and how their interviews and PR stunts take the limelight away from struggling unknown indie authors.&lt;br /&gt;
Get access to a &amp;quot;&amp;quot;Publishing Success Blueprint&amp;quot;&amp;quot; which will make sure you stick to your day job and never try some wacky creative idea ever again!&lt;br /&gt;
And find how the entire publishing industry deck is still stacked against you, so you might as well never try.&lt;br /&gt;
New Revision!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Contains actually helpful tips! (Don&amp;#39;t tell Richard this, but I included some tactics, strategies, and tips from later research. What you can find out, he doesn&amp;#39;t need to know...)&lt;br /&gt;
