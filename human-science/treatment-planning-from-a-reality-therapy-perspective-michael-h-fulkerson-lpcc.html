  <title>Treatment Planning from a Reality Therapy Perspective - Michael H. Fulkerson Lpcc</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Designed to be a primer for mental health practitioners desiring to write treatment plans from a reality therapy perspective, Treatment Planning from a Reality Therapy Perspective, by author Michael H. Fulkerson, provides an explanation of how reality therapy treatment planning differs from traditional treatment planning models, which are usually based on the medical model and/or external control psychology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fulkerson offers a synopsis of his experience and research using reality therapy as a treatment modality, presents a review of different treatment models and compares them to reality therapy, provides examples of how to write treatment goals and objectives from a public health model rather than from a medical model that are precise and measurable, covers documentation of progress notes, and discusses cases studies.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;A helpful resource for professionals wishing to incorporate reality therapy into treatment planning for their clients, this second edition of Treatment Planning from a Reality Therapy Perspective offers treatment plans from a reality therapy perspective that have been field-tested by a clinician who has received numerous successful reviews from health care organizations.&lt;/p&gt;" />
