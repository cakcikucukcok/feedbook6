  <title>The Naked State of Human Being: The Meaning of Gymnos in 2 Corinthians 5:3 and its Theological Implications - Luis Iván Martínez Toledo, Kim Papaioannou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This book explains the image of nakedness (gymnos) taken by Paul in the Corinthian correspondence to refer to the state of human being during death. Through an academic approach, but simple language, the author explains the biblical monist understanding of human being. He takes the biblical experience of death and resurrection to point out his arguments. This book uncovers the ancient problem of the continuation of personal identity from life prior to death, on to resurrection. It also provides a fresh biblical approach from an anthropological and biblical perspective to the problem of what being human really is. Those who enjoy traveling through the Bible with an open mind and warm heart will find in this book a good experience." />
