  <title>The Anatomy of Translation Problems - Peng-Yen Lai</title>
      <meta name="description" content="‘The Anatomy of Translation Problems’ is the summation of the author’s extensive teaching experience in the translation of economic editorials.  Throughout the author’s teaching experiences, Dr Lai has identified several problems that occur in a high frequency for both the beginner as well as advanced translators.  The ultimate aim of this book is to derive a translation principle that is able to solve a divergent range of translation problems, subsequently leading to the enhancement of translation quality and to show translators how to deal with these problems. It is the first book that introduces the translation of economic editorials, is  interdisciplinary in its nature as it cuts across four fields: economics, law, translation theory and transformational grammar (linguistics). The book bridges the gap between translation theory and real world translation problems. The application of this book is not restricted to economic editorials.  The principle of proportionality can be applicable to other types of editorials, including economics, foreign policy, politics, bioethics, and popular science." />
