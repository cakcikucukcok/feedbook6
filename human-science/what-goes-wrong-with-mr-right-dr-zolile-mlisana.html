  <title>What Goes Wrong with Mr. Right? - Dr. Zolile Mlisana</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I dedicate this work to the countless lives that have been broken or bewildered by love hurts. Many gave us a window into their shattered dreams, for your benefit. It is especially dedicated to those love hurts inflicted on children by parents, mentors and life coaches. These are hurts whose impacts have a malignant tendency to trickle down generations, with an ironic tendency to self-perpetuation.
The book also seeks to encourage and provide tools for people who are still &#39;sticking it out&#39;. The consequences of our teenage love games play themselves out in our adulthood. By that time it is often too late to reverse anything. The cycle can be broken.
Hopefully this book will help young people think about the future of their own children when they are tempted to fool around during their own formative years.
In some instances we have attempted to provide information and tools that will be essential for the therapist, counsellor or minister. There is a gentle mix of researched academic knowledge bundled with useful experiential anecdotes.
 For anyone who is searching for Mr or Miss Right, here is your road map  whether you are the hunter or the hunted." />
