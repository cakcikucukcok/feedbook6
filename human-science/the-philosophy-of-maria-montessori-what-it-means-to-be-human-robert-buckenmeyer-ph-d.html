  <title>The Philosophy of Maria Montessori:What It Means to Be Human - Robert Buckenmeyer  Ph.D.</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dr. Maria Montessori opened the first Casa dei Bambini (Childrens House) on 6 January 1907 in San Lorenzo, Rome. Through her observations and work with these children she discovered their astonishing, almost effortless ability to learn. Thus began a century of great work uncovering the true nature of childhood.
Times have changed, and science has made great progress, and so has our work; but our principles have only been confirmed, and along with them our conviction that mankind can hope for a solution to its problems, among which the most urgent are those of peace and unity, only by turning its attention and energies to the discovery of the child and to the development of the great potentialities of the human personality in the course of its formation.
