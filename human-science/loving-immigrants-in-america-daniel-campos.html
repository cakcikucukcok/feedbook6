  <title>Loving Immigrants in America - Daniel Campos</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;is a philosophical account of the author&amp;#39;s experience as a Latin American immigrant to the United States of America. A series of interrelated personal essays together convey this experience of walking or sauntering, going on road trips, reading American literature in the southern U.S., playing association football (soccer or &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;f&amp;uacute;tbol&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;), churchgoing, and Latin dancing in the U.S. This book&amp;rsquo;s central motif is the caring saunterer, who is understood to be a person who makes him or herself at home anywhere, even as a Latino immigrant in the U.S. The narrative essays convey one immigrant&amp;#39;s experience seeking an affective, social, and intellectual home in a new land. The intertwined philosophical reflections lead to the recommendation of an ethic of love &amp;ndash; resilient loving &amp;ndash; for the day to day interactions and long term relations between people, immigrants and hosts, in this country. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;s aim is to establish an open and earnest &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;philosophical&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; dialogue with critical readers interested in the problems surrounding immigration in the U.S. today. The author writes as an American philosopher&amp;mdash;in the continental sense of North, Central, and South America&amp;mdash;whose reflections provide an accessible and provocative angle for the development of insight into the experiences of immigrants in the U.S. Thus he brings philosophical reflection drawn from experience, in the broad American tradition, to bear on current issues&amp;mdash;on the problems of people and not of philosophers, as John Dewey might put it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;" />
