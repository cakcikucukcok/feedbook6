  <title>I Speak &#39;&#39;Their Language&#39;&#39; - DaShayne D. Walker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="I Speak, Their Language is a compilation of her stories and experiences in working with children with disabilities. She wants to share how we can all help.  This book is intended to motivate, educate and help us to relate.  Her hope is to increase participation and reduce discrimination from us to them.  She says: 
I speak as the voice of the parent who needs help and has become frustrated.                                                                                                                                I speak as the voice of the child who had no control over being born this way.                                                                                                                         I speak to the so-called normal people who lack understanding. 
I speak to inform you of ways to become that village that it takes to raise a child, ANY child because children dont come with manuals.
Children with special needs dont come outlines of their disabilities.
Parents of children with special needs dont come with extra strength, extra patience, dont get extra days off work, extra money to take care of or extra credit for doing a great job!
Parents of children with special needs are often drained of strength, drained of patience, drained of money, take excessive days off work and are discredited for fighting for anything extra. They get blacklisted. They get a hard time. They get a bad reputation.    And now they get MY VOICE!
