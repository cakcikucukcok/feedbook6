  <title>The Viper and the Storm - Tom Morris</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In this third volume of the philosophical adventure series &lt;em&gt;Walid and the Mysteries of Phi&lt;/em&gt;, a wise character speaks to every one of us when he says to his friends, &amp;ldquo;We&amp;rsquo;re all participants in a great drama that encompasses us in space and time. We&amp;rsquo;re chosen to help move it forward, but we never have to depend on just our own abilities to do so. We&amp;rsquo;re free, but we&amp;rsquo;re also deeply supported and guided. Let that build your confidence, your faith, and your hope in the future. Great things are afoot. And we&amp;rsquo;re among the foot soldiers of destiny.&amp;rdquo; That deep perspective plays out in this story through many surprises encountered by the two boys known as The Golden Viper and Windstorm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The short book, &lt;em&gt;The Oasis Within&lt;/em&gt;, followed a group from a small village in west Egypt as they crossed the vast desert headed for Cairo in the summer of 1934. It served as a prologue to the epic adventure that will continually reveal deep and surprising secrets about our world. &lt;em&gt;The Golden Palace&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Stone of Giza &lt;/em&gt;then&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;brought us drama, mystery, and a touch of romance, as the action began. In &lt;em&gt;The Viper and the Storm&lt;/em&gt;, the story will take us to more unexpected places. Walid Shabeezar, the Prince of Egypt, along with his friends Mafulla, Kissa, and Hasina, will face new challenges as they grow into what the future holds for them.&lt;/p&gt;" />
