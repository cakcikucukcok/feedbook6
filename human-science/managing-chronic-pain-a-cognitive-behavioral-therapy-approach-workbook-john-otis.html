  <title>Managing Chronic Pain: A Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Approach Workbook - John Otis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Chronic pain has a multitude of causes, many of which are not well understood or effectively treated by medical therapies.  Individuals with chronic pain often report that pain interferes with their ability to engage in occupational, social, or recreational activities. Sufferers inability to engage in these everyday activities may contribute to increased isolation, negative mood and physical deconditioning, which in turn can contribute to their experience of pain.  Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has been proven effective at managing various chronic pain conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, chronic back pain, and tension/migraine headache. The CBT treatment engages patients in an active coping process aimed at changing maladaptive thoughts and behaviors that can serve to maintain and exacerbate the experience of chronic pain. Overcoming Chronic Pain, Therapist Guide instills all of these empirically validated treatments into one comprehensive, convenient volume that no clinician can do without. By presenting the basic, proven-effective CBT methods used in each treatment, such as stress management, sleep hygiene, relaxation therapy and cognitive restructuring,  this guide can be used to treat all chronic pain conditions with success.  TreatmentsThatWorkTM represents the gold standard of behavioral healthcare interventions!  &lt;br/&gt;DT  All programs have been rigorously tested in clinical trials and are backed by years of research &lt;br/&gt;DT  A prestigious scientific advisory board, led by series Editor-In-Chief David H. Barlow, reviews and evaluates each intervention to ensure that it meets the highest standard of evidence so you can be confident that you are using the most effective treatment available to date &lt;br/&gt;DT  Our books are reliable and effective and make it easy for you to provide your clients with the best care available &lt;br/&gt;DT  Our corresponding workbooks contain psychoeducational information, forms and worksheets, and homework assignments to keep clients engaged and motivated &lt;br/&gt;DT  A companion website (www.oup.com/us/ttw) offers downloadable clinical tools and helpful resources &lt;br/&gt;DT  Continuing Education (CE) Credits are now available on select titles in collaboration with PsychoEducational Resources, Inc.
