  <title>Crooked Principles: Book Two of the Warren Files - Kevin Cady</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Elijah Warren was a workaholic for the FBI, but during his hunt for the vicious &quot;Poetic Murderer,&quot; he fell in love with Aurelia Blanc-a beautiful and erudite forensic pathologist-and they barely escaped with their lives.   They&#39;ve since left the FBI for slower days and a mountain cabin, but a desperate call from remote Alaska leaves them not a choice. Grizzly is a town of less than a hundred people, and for twelve straight years one of them has been killed. No one talks about the murders, like long-ignored secrets. In fact, it seems no one talks at all. But there&#39;s a sick change in the pattern of death, and a mournful mother wants answers after her five-year-old son is stabbed and bludgeoned to death.   Something is very wrong in the diffident town of Grizzly, and stranded by the winter, Elijah and Aurelia face the killer daily, with paranoia as real as the icy air of Alaska. This is nothing like they&#39;ve faced before.   Whose dark past will reveal Grizzly&#39;s secrets?" />
