  <title>The Glow - Howard Kaminsky</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;Jackie and Pete Lawrence were a typical young, sophisticated married couple- until they started jogging. And then a commitment to physical fitness became an unimaginable nightmare. . . Such is the premise of the Glow; a chilling tale of horror in which today&#39;s passion for physical fitness takes a terrifying contemporary twist. It is the story of a young Manhattan couple he, an up and coming book editor; she, a fashion buyer for a chic department store. They seem to have everything- youth, looks, good health. Moreover, the&#39;ve just found the apartment of their dreams in a charming townhouse on the Upper East Side. And they couldn&#39;t ask for more understanding landlords. The Jensens, the Macraes, and the Goodmans all are in their late fifties, but have the vigor and youthfulness of people many years their junior. Their secret, they say, is strenuous exercise and the company of an energetic young couple. Jackie and Pete are the third such couple to join their circle at Twelve East 83rd Street. Almost immediately, Pete is beguiled by the building&#39;s health regimen. He runs laps with the Twelvers in central park every morning, eagerly consumes their health food, and curtails his social life. At first Jackie is skeptical, but soon she too becomes a convert. never have they felt better. Then one of the other young couples in the building disappears over night, and life at Number Twelve is never the same again.&lt;/div&gt;" />
