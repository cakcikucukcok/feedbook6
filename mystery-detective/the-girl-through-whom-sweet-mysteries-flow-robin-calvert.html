  <title>The Girl Through  Whom Sweet  Mysteries  Flow - Robin Calvert</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Most of the main characters in the story are in the early twenties. While some of the plot deals with their romantic problems, the main thing is their attempt to solve the mystery of the murder of Nancy Bonwit, a former girlfriend of Mark Forbes. They come to believe the poems Mark Forbes wrote about Jean Bauer while they were separated have hidden meanings. They believe they can be read as parts of a puzzle, a solution of which will help lead the police to Nancys killer.
Mark Forbes is the earnest but flawed main male character in the story. Jean Bauer is the main female character. She and Mark went steady during her Junior and Senior years in high school. Marks clueless indifference to important things like Jeans birthday and Christmas finally result in a dramatic break up on Jeans Prom Night. Jean decides to attend college in New Jersey to get away from Marks and his indifferent ways. After her sophomore year she comes back home to her parents house in Maryland feeling that she has severed her ties with Mark. She transfers to another college near her home where she is befriended by Brenda Cranston who, like Jean, is in her junior years. It proves to be a faithful meeting. It is Brenda who first notices the dual meaning of Marks poems about Jeans and the mystical chemistry that seems to flow between them. And it is Brendas experiments with Jean acting as the guinea pig that prompts Jean to explore caverns , visit Marks first girlfriend, and come dangerously close to a hooded young men who maybe Nancys killer." />
