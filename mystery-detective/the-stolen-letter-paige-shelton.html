  <title>The Stolen Letter - Paige Shelton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Paige Shelton returns with the next installment of The Scottish Bookshop Mystery series, &lt;i&gt;The Stolen Letter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delaney Nichols is confident she&#39;s doing what she loves--case in point, just one day after returning from her fabulous European honeymoon, she&#39;s eager to get back to the Cracked Spine, the bookstore where she works. But as she disembarks her bus and hurries toward the shop she and another woman collide, sending a stack of books the woman is carrying to the ground. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delaney&#39;s hapless victim&#39;s name is Mary, and the two women can&#39;t help but notice that they bear an uncanny resemblance to one another. According to Mary, they both also look like the long-beheaded Mary Queen of Scots. Even stranger, Mary believes she is the reincarnation of the Scottish queen. But peculiar as Delaney&#39;s doppelganger is, she doesn&#39;t have time to dwell on it: on her arrival to the bookshop, she learns the Edinburgh city council wants to close the Cracked Spine, citing code violations, and she&#39;s determined to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when Mary&#39;s husband dies in a car explosion--and Delaney learns he was the very member of city council who proposed that the city take a closer look at the bookshop&#39;s construction--she starts to wonder if her meeting with Mary wasn&#39;t an accident. Edinburgh has become as filled with intrigue and deception as any European court, and Delaney is determined to get to the bottom of this royal mystery.&lt;/p&gt;" />
