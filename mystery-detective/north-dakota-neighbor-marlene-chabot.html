  <title>North Dakota Neighbor - Marlene Chabot</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Private Investigator Matt Malone is on the prowl again. This time he is looking for Brad Harper, a missing husband, who left his wife and kids with nothing but tons of debt.  &lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Unfortunately, the hunt for Harper is put on hold when Margaret Grimshaw, an elderly neighbor, drags the investigator into another case. Skeletal remains are uncovered on land that Evan Cox, a philanthropist and friend of Margaret&#39;s, recently donated to the Anoka-Hennepin School District. A new middle school may never get built unless Malone can prove the property wasn&#39;t used as an Indian burial site. &lt;/P&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Discussions with Dr. Ted Raines, head of the University of Minnesota&#39;s Anthropology Department and Dr. Russell, an Anoka County Coroner, don&#39;t reveal much. Relying on his instincts, Malone embarks on a journey to Bismark, North Dakota to seek a professor of Indian culture who may be able to unravel the mystery.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Getting more than he bargained for, Malone comes to terms with a Native American Indian belief, life is a circle. It is woven together by thin threads and all things being connected. Now, he must return to Minnesota, the place where both his cases began, to finish one unbelievable circle of life.&lt;/p&gt;" />
