  <title>The Butcher&#39;s Son - Grant McKenzie</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;div&gt;For one man, the past will never stay buried.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ian Quinn has spent his life protecting children from the monsters that live among us. As a Child Protection Officer, Ian places their lives above his own, and has no qualms about getting his hands dirty when it comes to protecting those who can&#39;t protect themselves. Years ago, Ian was unable to protect his own daughter when she was killed, and has channeled the anger and sadness into his vocation. Ian has tried to bury his past. But the past is far from done with him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ian&#39;s own father left years ago, leaving Ian and his sister alone. But out of the blue Ian is called by an attorney, claiming his father has recently died and named Ian in his will. Ian had assumed his father was long dead, and confused as to what he could possibly be needed for. When Ian goes to the lawyer&#39;s office, he is given three items:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The first is a key.&lt;br&gt;The second is a deed to his grandfather&#39;s old butcher shop.&lt;BR&gt;The Third is a letter from his from his father that reads simply and cryptically:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Sorry for everything, son, but it&#39;s your burden now.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" />
