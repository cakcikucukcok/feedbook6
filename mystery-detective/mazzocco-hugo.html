  <title>Mazzocco - Hugo</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;i&gt;Italy, The Roaring Twenties...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Suffering a shock defeat in the trial of the year, a young lawyer returns home to a town ravaged by luxury and excess. Caught between the failure that hangs over him and the pressure of his family&#39;s expectations, will he be able to make sense of his life once more?&lt;br/&gt;
Through grit and ambition, a bereft Cuban immigrant brings growth and prosperity to the small town that elected him mayor. But with the wolves of the Fascist Party baying and his Socialist values under threat, is there a more sinister reason for the clash between his daughter and his best friend?&lt;br/&gt;
Hounded by a violent, deranged stalker, will a successful art collector manage to escape the terrible fate looming over him? After months with no news, will a desperate father manage to track down the son he almost lost to the Great War? In Italy to expand their jewellery empire, will a wealthy, influential Indian family find their troubled daughter the help she needs?&lt;br/&gt;
And through it all, will the murder of a beloved doctor bring fractured families together, or widen the rifts between them beyond repair?&lt;br/&gt;
With people dropping around him like flies, join young Mario as he gives free rein to his analytical curiosity and cuts his investigative teeth on the mystery of the year. Get ready to laugh, sigh, gasp, and get caught up in a murky, tangled web of intrigue, murder, and suspense. Buy Mazzocco now!&lt;br/&gt;" />
