  <title>Secrets of Glenmary Farm - E. S. Burton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Janice Harmon knows there is more to retirement than sitting in her apartment feeling sorry for herself. Ready for new beginnings and with the help of her son, David, Janice moves to GlenMary Farm, a beautiful, peaceful estate tucked away in the gently rolling hills near Louisville, Kentucky. Yet despite her years and wealth of experience, nothing could have prepared Janice for what was to come.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;On the seven-hundred-acre estate, the old mansion and the thoroughbred barn have been transformed into a shared residence for senior citizens and emotionally disturbed children. As she settles into the mansion and begins fraternizing with her fellow residents, Janice soon meets young Emily Carpenter and her Arabian horse, Junior. The two strike up a lively conversation, and Janice feels right at home. But that warm feeling is about to disintegrate as she unwittingly becomes involved in unraveling a fourteen-year-old mystery that has already claimed two lives.&lt;/p&gt; 
&lt;p&gt;In this suspenseful tale filled with intrigue and murder, Janice soon discovers that the rippling effect from a violent incident is not only about to shake the very foundation of her belief in herself, but also her faith in her fellow man.&lt;/p&gt;" />
