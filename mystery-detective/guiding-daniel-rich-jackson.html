  <title>Guiding Daniel - Rich Jackson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Guiding Daniel details the meteoric rise and ultimate self-destruction of an American icon.  It is at heart a murder mystery, but it is also an examination of America&#39;s somewhat dark obsession with celebrity.  In a culture where fame is accepted as a pronouncement rather than achievment, celebrities provide the reality through which adoring fans live a virtual life.  Ultimately, disgrace and downfall are themes that familiarize celebrities in a relatable way.  We see that they too, are as flawed and human as the rest of us.
 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Danny Cagle is a gifted poet and musician whose star is on the rise.  When his wife Laura goes missing he must balance a burgeoning career, the care of his one-year old son and a search for answers to Laura&#39;s disappearance.  Predictably, as his fame increases, so does his drug usage, leading him into the kind of self-destruction that so emphatically defines an American icon. 
 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Guiding Daniel is a story of creative success, revenge, and a fall from grace.  It defines graphically Dostoevsky&#39;s contention that:  &quot;As long as man remains free he strives for nothing so incessantly and so painfully as to find someone to worship.&quot;    
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Guiding Daniel has all the elements to engage the reader.  It has a believable plot progression that provides clues, twists and a culprit whose motives evolve over the course of the story, and finally, a conclusive resolution." />
