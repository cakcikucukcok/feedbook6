  <title>A Homeland &amp; a Homeland - Nabil Abu Shreikh</title>
      <meta name="description" content="On their way to the sea shore, Fred was driving so slowly. Eleanor asked him teasingly whether there was a problem in his car, he smiled and said, I won&#39;t see or hear anything or (looking in her eyes) anyone more attractive than what I can hear and see! Why should I drive fast?&quot; Eleanor&#39;s face reddened and she smiled shyly and thanked him. Fred raised his eyebrows, smiled faintly and said to himself, A successful start!&quot;  
Eleanor sat on a bench and watched two snipe battling for a little chub in shallow water where a rivulet met the sea. The fish was moving joyfully under the golden rays of the evening sun. Fred was observing her closely. Then he said teasingly, What do you think of those two battling snipe? Are they males or females?&quot; She burst with laughter and dropped her head shyly. Then she said, You first!&quot; Fred bit his finger nail thoughtfully and said, Well, I&#39;ll tell you the snipe sex and you&#39;ll tell me the chub sex. Deal?&quot; No. Not deal.&quot; She said sweetly. I&#39;ll tell you the snipes sex and you&#39;ll tell me the fish sex. It&#39;s fair!&quot; Okay. Fire away!&quot; He accepted. The snipe are females!&quot; She said laughing. Wonderful! How did you know?&quot; Fred asked. Because the fish is a male!&quot; She said and burst with laughter. Fred, too, laughed until he lay down on his back on the sand breathless. When he had himself, he asked her permission for one more question; only one! What would they do if the fish were fat and adult?&quot; Eleanor laughed shyly and hurried to him and hid her face on his chest. He held her chin with his hand, raised her head, kissed her on her nose tip and returned her head to its place on his chest wiping her smooth and long hair. She heard his heart beats. A moment later, she raised her head, hugged and kissed him a long, long one. Abruptly, an artillery shell past whistling over their heads and splashed the sea water. The whole place vibrated when it exploded. Both of Eleanor and Fred were shocked and terrified. They hurried to the car." />
