      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Serenity Landon hadnt had such a great life as the youngest daughter of the California alpha. Her mother died when she was fourteen in a pack war with Nevada. When the alpha of the Nevada pack died, Serenitys father planned to gain the territory by making his only two daughters marry the sons of the recently deceased alpha. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Serenity and her sister, Rena, hated the Nevada pack. They never got along. Both girls refused to marry the guys they hated, especially at the young ages of 16 and 18. When it became clear that they had no choice, the sisters decided to run away&lt;/p&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;On the run, the sisters meet Zander and Zane, who are also runaways. They travel together, always on the lookout for danger. Will they finally be safe in a new home across the Country? Or will they be found? &lt;/p&gt;" />
