      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SOON TO BE A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The instant &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; and #1 international bestseller. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;You should read &lt;i&gt;Behind Her Eyes&lt;/i&gt;...It&#39;s bloody brilliant.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;--&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stephen King   &lt;/b&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;An eerie thriller...Pinborough keeps us guessing about just who&#39;s manipulating whom - until the ending reveals that we&#39;ve been wholly complicit in this terrifying mind game.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The New York Times Book Review&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Why is everyone talking about the ending of Sarah Pinborough&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Behind Her Eyes&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Louise is a single mom, a secretary, stuck in a modern-day rut. On a rare night out, she meets a man in a bar and sparks fly. Though he leaves after they kiss, she&#39;s thrilled she finally connected with someone.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Louise arrives at work on Monday, she meets her new boss, David. The man from the bar. The very married man from the bar...who says the kiss was a terrible mistake, but who still can&#39;t keep his eyes off Louise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then Louise bumps into Adele, who&#39;s new to town and in need of a friend. But she also just happens to be married to David. And if you think you know where this story is going, think again, because &lt;i&gt;Behind Her Eyes&lt;/i&gt; is like no other book you&#39;ve read before.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;David and Adele look like the picture-perfect husband and wife. But then why is David so controlling? And why is Adele so scared of him?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As Louise is drawn into David and Adele&#39;s orbit, she uncovers more puzzling questions than answers. The only thing that is crystal clear is that something in this marriage is very, very wrong. But Louise can&#39;t guess how wrong--and how far a person might go to protect their marriage&#39;s secrets.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In &lt;i&gt;Behind Her Eyes&lt;/i&gt;, Sarah Pinborough has written a novel that takes the modern day love triangle and not only turns it on its head, but completely reinvents it in a way that will leave readers reeling.&lt;/p&gt;" />
