  <title>Forget You Know Me - Jessica Strawser</title>

A video call between friends captures a shocking incident no one was supposed to see.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The secrets it exposes threaten to change their lives forever.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Molly and Liza have always been enviably close. Even after Molly married Daniel, the couple considered Liza an honorary family member. But after Liza moved away, things grew more strained than anyone wanted to admit--in the friendship &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the marriage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Daniel goes away on business, Molly and Liza plan to reconnect with a nice long video chat after the kids are in bed. But then Molly leaves the room to check on a crying child.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Liza sees next will change everything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only one thing is certain: Molly needs her.
