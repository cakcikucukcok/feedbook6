  <title>The Ancient Rain - Domenic Stansberry</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Edgar Award winner and master of contemporary noir Domenic Stansberry returns to San Francisco&#39;s North Beach and Dante Mancuso, the dark PI who grew up on its tough streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a career with a shadowy security firm with interests on both sides of the law, Dante has come home to put all that behind him and has gone to work for a private investigator. A call alerts him early one morning that Bill Owens, a fellow PI, has been charged with a notorious thirty-year-old killing. Bill was involved in a political group in the late sixties, which among other pranks and small-time crimes, held up a bank. Except that time, an innocent bystander was shot and killed. To clear Owens of these charges, Dante will have to retrace the original investigation through San Francisco&#39;s radical underground and bring in the man who was pulling the strings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Ancient Rain&lt;/i&gt; is a chilling novel from one of crime fiction&#39;s finest. Stansberry spools out a narrative filled with deceit and betrayal, and in his hands the line between justice and revenge is razor sharp.&lt;/p&gt;" />
