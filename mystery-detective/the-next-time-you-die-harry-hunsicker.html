  <title>The Next Time You Die - Harry Hunsicker</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;How many ways can the past come back to haunt you? Hard-nosed &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dallas&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt; detective Lee Henry Oswald is about to find out. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a bourbon-swilling Baptist preacher hires private detective Lee &lt;i&gt;Henry&lt;/i&gt; Oswald to recover a stolen file, Oswald figures the job for a quick and painless infusion of cash.&lt;br&gt;            But nothing comes easily in Dallas for anybody named Oswald, especially when a psychopathic hit man from out of town shows up, intent on finding the same scrap of missing paper.&lt;br&gt;            With the police after him for a murder he didn&#39;t commit and his every move shadowed by the strange mobster, Hank Oswald gratefully accepts an extortion case in an effort to get out of town for a few days.  State Senator Eddie Black, the tree-hugging black sheep of an oil-rich East Texas family, has a problem.  Somebody wants him to change his vote on an important environmental bill.  If he refuses, Black&#39;s long-time friend and his entire family will be killed, one by one, starting with the oldest child, the head-strong Tess McPherson.&lt;br&gt;            In the aftermath of a bloody encounter with the mobster at Tess McPherson&#39;s apartment, Oswald finally realizes the chilling connection between the two cases: a dead man named Billy Barringer, Hank&#39;s onetime best friend and the firstborn son of an East Texas crime boss.&lt;br&gt;            As the stakes mount, each treacherous step toward the missing file forces Oswald to confront the haunting memory of a split second decision which ultimately cost Billy Barringer his life.&lt;br&gt;            Now it looks like the dead man&#39;s family has teamed up with the new player in town, and everybody&#39;s got Oswald in their cross hairs.  As the clock ticks down to a startling climax, Oswald races across the mean streets of Dallas to find the missing file and the secret it holds.&lt;br&gt;            Once the file is found, the explosive discovery forces a dangerous decision, one full of hard choices Oswald thought had been left long ago in his murky past.&lt;/p&gt;" />
