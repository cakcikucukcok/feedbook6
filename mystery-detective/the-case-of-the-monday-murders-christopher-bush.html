  <title>The Case of the Monday Murders - Christopher Bush</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Murder on Mondays! Greatest prophecy of the century! T.P. Luffham was murdered!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ferdinand Pole of the Murder League claims that, since 1918, thirteen murders have been committed on a Monday. A sleazy economist has now been slain, followed the next week by a blameless actress&amp;mdash;both on Monday. While the press have a field day, it is up to Inspector Wharton of Scotland Yard, along with his inspired amateur co-investigator Ludovic Travers, to see if London has a new Jack the Ripper at work. The eccentric parrot-owning Pole seems to be out to implicate himself in the murders, though whether this is bravado or fact remains very much in question . . . This sly, often satirical, whodunit shows a master of classic mystery on top form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Case of the Monday Murders&lt;/em&gt; was originally published in 1936. This new edition features an introduction by crime fiction historian Curtis Evans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Travers&lt;/em&gt;: &amp;ldquo;As for my methods of crime detection&amp;mdash;well, I haven&amp;rsquo;t any. For that my only tool is a brain that has been called agile, sharpened on crosswords rather than chess.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
