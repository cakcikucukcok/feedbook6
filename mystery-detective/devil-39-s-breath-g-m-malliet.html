  <title>Devil&#39;s Breath - G. M. Malliet</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Agatha Award-winning author G. M. Malliet returns with &lt;i&gt;Devil&#39;s Breath&lt;/i&gt;, the sixth mystery in her wildly popular series featuring handsome spy-turned-cleric Father Max Tudor. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having realized there is no escape from his past as an agent, Max has offered his services to MI5 on an as-needed basis. Now it&#39;s time for him to follow through. The body of glamorous film star Margot Browne has washed ashore from a luxury yacht and Max&#39;s former colleague wants his help to find the murderer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a perfect &quot;closed circle&quot; murder since victim Margot must have been killed by one of the actors, stylists, screenwriters, or second-tier royalty aboard. The investigation into Margot&#39;s lurid past uncovers a host of motives--it seems she was not the only person on board with a secret they&#39;d kill to keep.&lt;/p&gt;" />
