  <title>Multiple Suspects - Jerry Radford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="William Rollins, Special Agent in charge of the bank robbery division of the FBI, has the call. Special Agent Stephanie Drysdale gets the assignment. Shes young. Shes aggressive. Shes a star in the making in the Richmond, Virginia office. A deposit of bills with sequential numbers shows up in a bank in LaPlata, Maryland. The bills originated with the robbery of Short Pump National bank nineteen months earlier in Richmond. She and Rollins trace the bills to a church in King George, Virginia. A second deposit pops up in Richmond. Then a third. And a fourth. In each case, bills have been donated anonymously to a worthy cause. The bills keep coming. Capturing and prosecuting two bank robbers is at stake, but something is amiss. 
PRAISE FOR JERRY RADFORD
No One Can know
The story alone is the stuff of bestsellers and hit movies, but the real fun here is the authors talent with dialogue and edgy characters. If you like Harlan Coben and Dennis LeHane, then youll like Jerry Radford. Larry Brooks, Bestselling author of Bait and Switch, Serpents Dance, Pressure Points, Darkness Bound, and Whisper of the Seventh Thunder
One After Another
An impressive edge-of-your-seat trifecta of horse racing, bank robbing, and special effects. You cant predict or second guess the plot twists and story lines in a Radford novel, which might not work in betting the ponies, but results in an absolute jackpot for the reader.  Jamie Layton, Ducks Cottage Bookstore
