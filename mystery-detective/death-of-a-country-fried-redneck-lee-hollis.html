  <title>Death of a Country Fried Redneck - Lee Hollis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Local food and drink writer Haley Powell thinks she&#39;s done solving murders in scenic Bar Harbor, Maine. But when a taste of the South comes to New England, Haley&#39;s following another recipe for disaster.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a single mom, Hayley Powell already has a full plate--she&#39;s got deadlines to make and a teenage daughter with eyes for an aspiring singer-songwriter. But when country music superstar Wade Springer rolls into town, Hayley spies an irresistible side gig: personal chef to her all-American idol. After he tries her home cooking, Wade&#39;s so impressed that he hires her on the spot--and invites her to dine with him alone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hayley and Wade are hitting all the right notes.  .  .until a body turns up. Wade&#39;s tour bus was torched overnight and a roadie named Mickey Pritchett came out well-done. But the real cause of death isn&#39;t barbecue: Mickey was shot, his mouth stuffed with one of Hayley&#39;s trademark chicken legs. An ornery drunk, Mickey had already made plenty of enemies in town, but Wade&#39;s reputation is on the rocks. Hayley reckons it&#39;s up to her to settle this mess--a charbroiled mystery with all the fixin&#39;s.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Includes seven delectable recipes from Hayley&#39;s kitchen!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Praise for Death of a Kitchen Diva&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Delicious and satisfying. Another course, please.&quot;  --Carolyn Hart&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Readers will be calling for a second round from author Lee Hollis.&quot; --Leslie Meier, author of &lt;i&gt;Chocolate Covered Murder&lt;/i&gt;" />
