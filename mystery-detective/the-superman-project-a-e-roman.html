  <title>The Superman Project - A. E. Roman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;After a series of low-paying jobs, Chico Santana, PI, is living in his tiny office on 149th Street in the Bronx. He&#39;s in an absolutely foul mood when Pablo Sanchez and his mother drop in, seeking help for one of Chico&#39;s old childhood pals----the handsome and charismatic Joey Ventura. Chico has not seen Joey since Joey disappeared from St. Mary&#39;s Home for Boys, headed for Tahiti. He ended up, instead, on the island of TSP---The Superman Project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Superman Project peddles German philosophy, Hinduism, and American comic book mythology as a method toward self-improvement, but its members are hiding more than a few secrets. The leader of TSP is a man named Father Ravi. One of his daughters, Gabby, who is also Joey&#39;s wife, is missing. Joey was accused by the TSP leaders of killing Gabby and has fled the police. Pablo and his mother insist he is innocent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compelled to believe in his old friend, and by the promised payment of a very valuable &lt;i&gt;Superman&lt;/i&gt; comic, Chico investigates the competing interests in the organization, falling for a beautiful suspect and trying to look out for a friend&#39;s troubled niece in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. E. Roman brings New York City and its eccentric characters to life in this second in the original and energetic Chico Santana series.&lt;/p&gt;" />
