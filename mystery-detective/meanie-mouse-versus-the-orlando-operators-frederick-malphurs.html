  <title>Meanie Mouse Versus the Orlando Operators - Frederick Malphurs</title>
      <meta name="description" content="An in-vitro fertilization accident results in the birth of a very special, unique person, our heroine, Melanie Moody.  She transforms herself into a beautiful, brilliant, hard working and slightly demented justice-for-all superhero.  As she strives to create a better world, she helps those she finds in need and vows to protect the underdog.&lt;p&gt;
	The setting for this story is Orlando in Central Florida.  The world capital of family entertainment, fun, magic, imagination and thrills, Orlando is enjoyed by millions of people who visit every year.  But, just out of their sight, hidden behind the subtropical beauty lies another playground where real people work, live, and die.&lt;p&gt;
	When the cold, dead body of a beautiful Russian migr is found naked in Orlando&#39;s finest hospital, the pressures of that alternate reality begin to burst into the carefully fabricated fantasy world that the powers that be and the tourists love.  Pro football attracts the attention of our heroine.  From the naked dead woman to the professional football field, Melanie leaves no stone unturned as she begins to unravel the clues that point her to the killer.  She emerges from the shadows to become Orlando&#39;s heroine, Meanie Mouse." />
