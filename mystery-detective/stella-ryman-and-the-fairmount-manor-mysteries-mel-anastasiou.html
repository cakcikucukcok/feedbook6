  <title>Stella Ryman and the Fairmount Manor Mysteries - Mel Anastasiou</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;On this particular sun-and-shade April morning at Fairmount Manor, Stella Ryman no more entertained the idea of becoming an amateur sleuth than she did of entering next spring&amp;rsquo;s Boston Marathon. For not only was Stella eighty-two years old, but she had lately sold her home and a lifetime of gathered possessions and washed up at Fairmount Manor Care Home in such a state that she would have bet her remaining seven pairs of socks that she&amp;rsquo;d be dead in half a year. But when money goes missing and an innocent woman stands to lose her job at Fairmount; when malicious poison pen letters find their way into the hands of staff and residents; and when a resident vanishes without a trace, Stella takes matters into her own hands. To hell with being elderly &amp;mdash; Stella will break every one of the Director&amp;rsquo;s rules and slash all the institutional red tape in the place in her struggle to solve mysteries and protect the innocent. Over the course of the first five mystery adventures, Mrs Stella Ryman transforms from a woman on her deathbed to a force of nature and intellect. She&amp;rsquo;s a fish out of water, a stranger in a strange land, and an amateur sleuth trapped in a down-at-the-heels care home. You&amp;rsquo;d be cranky, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Readers are saying &amp;ldquo;witty and endearing&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;beautifully written with humour, grace, and suspense&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;You know a story&amp;rsquo;s good when you keep finding yourself laughing out loud.&amp;quot; &amp;ldquo;Stella Ryman is my new hero!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;" />
