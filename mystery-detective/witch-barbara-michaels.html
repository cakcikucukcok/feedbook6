  <title>Witch - Barbara Michaels</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;For Ellen March, the secluded old house nestled in the pine woods is more than the dream home she&#39;s long been searching for. It&#39;s an escape, a chance to start over, to forget the pain of her failed marriage and enjoy the restful pace of small-town living. Here, too, is a golden opportunity to get to know Norman McKay, her handsome and worldly new neighbor. But after dark in Ellen&#39;s &quot;perfect&quot; house, strange visions invade her restless mind: silent strangers moving through the twilight shadows, the ghostly figure of a woman and a spectral white cat. Ellen came here hoping to bury the past, but something terrifying has taken its place. Her safe haven has become her prison . . . and there is &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; escape.&lt;/p&gt;" />
