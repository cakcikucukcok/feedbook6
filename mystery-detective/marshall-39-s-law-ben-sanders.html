  <title>Marshall&#39;s Law - Ben Sanders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Ex-undercover cop Marshall Grade is hiding out in California when he learns that federal agent Lucas Cohen has survived a kidnapping. Cohen was Marshall&#39;s ticket into witness protection, and his captors have a simple question: where&#39;s Marshall now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marshall&#39;s undercover work gave him a long list of enemies, and the enemy in this case is a corrupt businessman named Dexter Vine. Vine&#39;s almost broke, in debt to people even worse than himself, and he wants to settle old scores while he has time. He&#39;s hired Ludo Coltrane--a nonchalant psychopath and part-time bar manager--to find Marshall at any cost. Ludo&#39;s no stranger to killing, but his associate, the cash-strapped ex-con Perry Rhodes, may prove more of a liability than an asset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question to be answered in &lt;i&gt;Marshall&#39;s Law &lt;/i&gt;is: what has Marshall done to make Dexter want him dead? And are the contacts from his old life--ex-colleague Lana, and the heroin dealer Henry Lee--prepared to help him, or will they just sell him out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the thrilling, action-packed Marshall Grade novels by Ben Sanders, an ex-undercover NYPD officer in witness protection is on the run from the criminals he ratted out. But Marshall can&#39;t remain in hiding when people&#39;s lives are at stake and he can do something about it-even if it means putting himself in the crosshairs of every contract killer hired to settle old scores. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;For lovers of Jack Reacher and Jason Bourne there is a new gun in town-a noble loner called Marshall Grade.&quot; &lt;/b&gt;--&lt;b&gt;Michael Robotham, bestselling author of &lt;i&gt;Suspect &lt;/i&gt;(on &lt;i&gt;American Blood&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
