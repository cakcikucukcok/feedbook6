  <title>That Silent Night - Tasha Alexander</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&#39;Tis the season for murder, mayhem, and mistletoe across the pond from &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Tasha Alexander&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this new short story from Tasha Alexander, Lady Emily -- called &quot;Victorian London&#39;s most colorful and delightfully eccentric sleuth&quot;* -- and her dashing husband Colin are spending a few days in London, doing some last-minute Christmas shopping and making the most of the time alone, when they find themselves in the middle of an unexpected mystery. The couple is just getting cozy, not at all bothered by the storm outside. But when Lady Emily looks out the window to see a woman standing in the blowing snow, without a coat, an eerie feeling falls over her, and she rushes out to help, only to find that the woman has disappeared. Colin is convinced her eyes were playing tricks on her, but Emily is haunted by the woman&#39;s image. Clearly, there is something spooky afoot, and she is determined to get to the bottom of it. . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete with the vivid descriptions and period detail Lady Emily fans have come to expect from this series, &lt;i&gt;That Silent Night &lt;/i&gt;is a delicious morsel of a mystery, with an irresistible ghost story at its heart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*Jacqueline Winspear, New York Times bestselling author of the Maisie Dobbs series&lt;/p&gt;" />
