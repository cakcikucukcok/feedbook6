  <title>A Scourge of Vipers - Bruce DeSilva</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Bruce DeSilva&#39;s &lt;i&gt;A Scourge of Vipers&lt;/i&gt; is at once a suspenseful crime story and a serious exploration of the hypocrisy surrounding sports gambling and the corrupting influence of big money on politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve Rhode Island&#39;s budget crisis, the state&#39;s colorful governor, Attila the Nun, wants to legalize sports gambling; but her plan has unexpected consequences. Organized crime, professional sports leagues, and others who have a lot to lose--or gain--if gambling is made legal flood the state with money to buy the votes of state legislators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liam Mulligan, investigative reporter for &lt;i&gt;The Providence Dispatch&lt;/i&gt;, wants to investigate, but his bottom-feeding corporate bosses at the dying newspaper have no interest in serious reporting. So Mulligan goes rogue, digging into the story on his own time. When a powerful state legislator turns up dead, an out-of-state bag man gets shot, and his cash-stuffed briefcase goes missing, Mulligan finds himself the target of shadowy forces who seek to derail his investigation by destroying his career, his reputation, and perhaps even his life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
