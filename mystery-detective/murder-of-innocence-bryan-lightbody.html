  <title>Murder of Innocence - Bryan Lightbody</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Summer 1914: a calamitous war has just begun in Europe, but just how close did celebrated detective Chief Superintendent Robert Ford come to changing history? 
Europe, Summer 1911 and Robert Ford, head of Londons Metropolitan Police Special Branch, is assigned on the Kings directions as personal protection officer to Prime-minister Herbert Henry Asquith. Ford has been chosen due to a series of assassinations of politicians attending gala events. No one knows who is conducting such a campaign, but it is suspected whoever it is their goal is clear; destabilize the old alliances and bring about war. Ford breaks the first lead in the case when he foils an assassin in Paris.
However, Ford is discouraged from any investigation by cabinet Minister William Olivier who claims it has been the work of a lone gunman and no one else. Olivier is a member of the Intelligentsia whose intention is to destroy the current European order by war to further their own economic ends, with his conspirators they must find a new group to finance to bring about their ambitions. Enter Major Tankosic, deputy head of Serbian military intelligence, co-founder of Black Hand and sponsor of radicals Danilo Illic and Gavrilo Princip, founders of the Young Bosnians. 
Spring 1914. A member of Fords unit infiltrates the Intelligentsia as its founders butler. But, he is discovered by his employer Lord Charlton Boyd just as he gains one tantalizing piece of information for Special Branch. Before passing this intelligence on he disappears. Ford tries to convince Asquith to allow him leave from his London duties to break the case within the Austro-Hungarian Empire in Europe. Olivier has Asquiths ear and convinces him Ford has no place being involved in protection duties within a competing and hostile empire. 
However, Ford finds a way and travels to the heart of Balkans and eventually to the service of Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Time is ticking away and the conspirators are already in Sarajevo. They know the Heir Apparent is coming and his murder will be their catalyst to spark a revolution. Major Tankosic seems to always lag one step behind. How have these simple student boys had the money and wherewithal to move so easily around the country? 
June 1914, Ford certain about the conspiracy, cannot persuade the Archduke to take his personal safety seriously. Ford insists that he travel as protection officer with the Archduke or at least as his driver. His request is refused. 
Gavrilo Princip stands in wait. Soon Ford will discover a shocking truth about British military intelligence and the Sarajevo conspiracy." />
