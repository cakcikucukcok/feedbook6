  <title>Solomon&#39;s Panel: Lawhet Suliman - Mohammed Abdullah Bindayel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Imagine having the opportunity to see a piece of history in real life. Even touch it. And then think about having the opportunity to own such a part of history. What would you be willing to do?   Author Mohammad Abdullah Bindayel presents such a possibility in his book Solomon&#39;s Panel: Lawhet Suliman. A mysterious panel commissioned by the prophet Solomon is available for purchase. It is a little known object made of glass and gems. Some say it has powers, while others are more skeptical. Regardless of possible powers the panel may have, the object certainly has historical and archaeological value, and the list of people wanting to add it to their collections grows. As sellers and buyers enter the fray, competition becomes fierce-as does the mystery surrounding the panel.   Solomon&#39;s Panel: Lawhet Suliman is an opportunity to learn about a culture many may not be familiar with. You will be intrigued by this search for a treasure and the history surrounding it." />
