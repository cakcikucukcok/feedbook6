  <title>Joanne Fluke Christmas Bundle: Sugar Cookie Murder, Candy Cane Murder, Plum Pudding Murder, &amp; Gingerbread Cookie Murder - Joanne Fluke, Laura Levine, Leslie Meier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The holidays are the icing on the cake for bakery owner Hannah Swensen. Surrounded by her loved ones, she has all the ingredients for a perfect Christmas--until murder is added to the mix.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  When it comes to holidays, Minnesotans rise to the occasion--and the little town of Lake Eden is baking up a storm with Hannah leading the way. The annual Christmas Buffet is the final test of the recipes Hannah has collected for the Lake Eden Holiday Buffet Cookbook.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &#39;Tis the season for trimming the tree, caroling, baking cookies, and curling up by the Yuletide waiting for Santa to drop down the chimney. But in this festive collection of holiday whodunits, murder is also paying a visit.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;  &quot;Candy Cane Murder&quot; By Joanne Fluke&lt;/b&gt;  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    When a trail of candy canes leads to a corpse outfitted in a Santa suit on a snowy bank, Hannah Swensen sets out to discover who killed Kris Kringle.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; The yuletide season in Lake Eden, Minnesota, guarantees a white Christmas, delectable holiday goodies from Hannah Swensen&#39;s bakery, The Cookie Jar--and murder. As a shadow hangs over her friends&#39; Christmas wedding, Hannah&#39;s determined to cook a killer&#39;s goose before anyone else gets burned.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  The Cookie Jar&#39;s busiest time of the year also happens to be the most wonderful time.  .  .for Christmas cookies, Hannah&#39;s own special plum pudding--and romance! She also gets a kick out of &quot;Lunatic Larry Jaeger&#39;s Crazy Elf Christmas Tree Lot,&quot; a kitschy carnival taking place smack-dab in the middle of the village green. But then Hannah discovers the man himself dead as a doornail in his own office.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Nothing&#39;s better on Christmas Eve than waiting for the stroke of midnight with a cup of eggnog and a plate of warm gingerbread cookies. But in this merry collection of holiday mysteries, murder is making its own special delivery.  .  .&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&quot;Gingerbread Cookie Murder&quot; By Joanne Fluke&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  When Hannah Swensen finds her neighbor Ernie Kusak with his head bashed in and sprawled on the floor of his condo next to an upended box of Hannah&#39;s Gingerbread Cookies, she discovers a flurry of murder suspects that&#39;s as long as her holiday shopping list." />
