  <title>The Whole Lie - Steve Ulfelder</title>

Readers will want to see more of Ulfelder&#39;s tough but vulnerable lead, whose narration offers a warts-and-all view of his multifaceted character.&quot; - &lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, starred review&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Savvy hadn&#39;t changed.  She was smarter than you and didn&#39;t mind letting you know it.  She&#39;d whip you up and down trying to get her way.  But we weren&#39;t lovers any more--and she&#39;d stopped being a Barnburner long ago.  Still...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conway Sax, the no-nonsense auto mechanic with a knack for solving difficult problems for the Barnburners, the renegade AA group who saved his life, is back in &lt;i&gt;The Whole Lie&lt;/i&gt;.  And for once, he thinks normalcy is within reach. He&#39;s opening a new garage, and he&#39;s finally moved in with longtime girlfriend Charlene.  The end of his parole is finally in sight. Then along comes Savannah Kane: smart, smoky, and a pusher of men&#39;s buttons. Seven years ago, Conway helped her disappear--but not before they had a sizzling, knock-down-drag-out affair. Now she&#39;s back with a shocking revelation: she&#39;s the mother of a six-year-old boy. Savvy claims her son&#39;s father is billionaire Bert Saginaw, but Conway (not to mention Charlene) knows she&#39;s back for more than just a family reunion.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saginaw wants to be Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts. Savvy wants to get paid. Conway wants nothing to do with either of them. But when Savvy turns up brutally murdered, he&#39;s got no choice but to sort lies from truth - even though doing so may cost him his freedom, his lover, and his life in this thrilling and heart-wrenching follow-up to critically acclaimed novel &lt;i&gt;Purgatory Chasm&lt;/i&gt;, in the tradition of Robert B. Parker and Dennis Lehane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Praise for Steve Ulfelder and &lt;i&gt;Purgatory Chasm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ulfelder smoothly steers his plot from one hairpin twist to the next... Conway [is] both tough and vulnerable, a man who has made too many mistakes in his life and, unfortunately, will make even more. &lt;i&gt;Purgatory Chasm&lt;/i&gt; is a superb beginning for an author who shows much promise.&quot; -&lt;i&gt;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &quot;A refreshing new character solving hardcore crimes.... crisp plotting, hard-boiled style and realistic dialogue.&quot; &lt;i&gt;--Associated Press &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Combines elements of the thriller with tales of tangled families. Violence runs through the novel, but Ulfelder tempers it with compassion -- and evocative prose. &lt;i&gt;Purgatory Chasm&lt;/i&gt; may be hardboiled, but it&#39;s heart-wrenching, too.&quot; -&lt;i&gt;Richmond Times-Dispatch&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Working throughout is the edgy, self-effacing voice of a flawed main character, a good guy with plenty of baggage who&#39;s just trying stay alive and to get it right this time.&quot; -&lt;i&gt;The Boston Globe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ulfelder couples precise, evocative prose with an original private investigator in his compelling hard-boiled debut.... Ulfelder smoothly navigates the many plot twists, and effortlessly introduces wrinkles in his protagonist&#39;s backstory that enhance the character.&quot; -&lt;i&gt;Publishers Weekly&lt;/i&gt;, starred review&lt;/p&gt;" />
