  <title>The Winter of Her Discontent - Kathryn Miller Haines</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s tough shooting for stardom when there&#39;s a war on. But Rosie&#39;s got enough pluck for two: she&#39;s willing to stumble around in a Broadway dance chorus that she has no right to be a part of, in a musical that&#39;s got &quot;flop&quot; written all over it. And all the while, she&#39;s worrying about her missing-in-action soldier boyfriend, who hasn&#39;t written in months. Lately, she&#39;s also been keeping bad company with her mob-muscle pal, Al, who&#39;s dabbling in a host of shady money-making enterprises in this time of shortages and rationing. But despite his illicit line of work, Al&#39;s no killer. When the cops finger him for his girlfriend&#39;s murder, Rosie and Jayne, her close compatriot/fellow castmate, set out to clear big Al&#39;s name, and plunge into an intricate backstage drama featuring a bevy of suspiciously well-dressed wannabe starlets. But the plot could soon be taking another lethal turn, bringing a final curtain down on Rosie, Jayne, and all their good intentions.&lt;/p&gt;" />
