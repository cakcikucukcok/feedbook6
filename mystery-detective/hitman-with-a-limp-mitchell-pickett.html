  <title>Hitman with a Limp - Mitchell Pickett</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Marshall Jones was a legendary hitman (at least in his own mind) before a gunshot wound to his ankle forced his early retirement. After limping through a decade of booze, pills, and cheap prostitutes, Marshalls life has become a constant state of misery.  
One day Marshall learns that Mason, his estranged brother, owes two million dollars to a ruthless drug lord named Medrano. Marshall has to travel to Costa Rica in order to kill Medrano, save his brother, and earn a huge payday. Marshall initially refuses the job, but when he learns that Elise, his twelve-year-old niece, is also involved in the mess, Marshall decides to come out of retirement and get back into the business of killing. 
Things immediately go wrong for Marshall and he realizes that hes not only rusty, but begins to question whether he ever had any skills as a contract killer in the first place. Dropped into an environment thats part paradise and part hell-on-earth, Marshall is forced to deal with psychotic drug dealers, a deadbeat brother, a sassy niece and the realization that life isnt easy being a hitman with a limp." />
