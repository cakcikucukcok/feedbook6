  <title>Cat Deck the Halls - Shirley Rousseau Murphy</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The cats who saved Christmas . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charming seaside village of Molena Point, California, leads one to expect a quiet traditional Christmas surrounded by family and friends&amp;#8212;but not this holiday season. Instead of singing carols and climbing into Christmas trees, Joe Grey, feline P.I., is faced with his most difficult case yet&amp;#8212;and that&#39;s saying a lot for a wily tomcat who for years has been solving crimes the police can&#39;t even crack.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At midnight in the deserted gardens of the shopping plaza, a stranger lies dead beneath the village Christmas tree; the only witness to the shooting is a little child. But when the police arrive, summoned by an anonymous phone call of feline origin, both the body and the child have disappeared. As police scramble for leads, the grey tomcat, his tabby lady, and their tortoiseshell pal, Kit, launch their own unique investigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together Joe Grey, Dulcie, and Kit face their most heartbreaking case yet as they care for the child who may be the killer&#39;s next target. Trying to sort out perplexing clues amidst the happiness of the season, they shadow a cast of colorful characters. But neither the police nor their unknown feline assistants are aware that they might have stumbled over the murderer and never known it, until an electrifying final scene when the killer&#39;s identity is revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For years Shirley Rousseau Murphy has written tales that have delighted readers and critics alike. With her lyrical prose and fast-paced plotting, Murphy has created another delightfully absorbing trip to a magical place populated by unforgettable characters whom readers have come to think of as friends.&lt;/p&gt;" />
