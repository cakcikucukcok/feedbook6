  <title>Pure Evil - John Lawe</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Matt Kinlers world is turned upside down in one telephone call. When the former FBI agent answers the call, he learns an informant from his FBI days is in trouble. The caller claims to be the informants daughter. Matt knows of no such daughter. How could he? The man dropped out of sight over twenty years ago. He responds out of loyalty, but he has no idea where the informant lives or what name he has assumed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are only two men who would want to hunt Jesse Lopez down and kill him: a drug cartel member and his twin brother, but they are locked up for terms the prosecutor described to news reporters as virtual life sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Matt goes to his former employer for help, he is met with indifference and suspicion. Left on his own, he discovers he must weave his way through a minefield of obstacles created by the bizarre actions of an over-zealous federal prosecutor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, a killer and the prosecutor are not his only concern. Anna Kinler has other ideas on how her husband should use his time. Matt scrambles to juggle Annas pro bono work with his efforts to save Jesse, but can he? This fast-paced story will give you the answer with a thrilling mix of mystery, suspense, and humor.&lt;/p&gt;" />
