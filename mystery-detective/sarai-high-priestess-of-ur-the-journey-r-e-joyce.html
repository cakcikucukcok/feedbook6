  <title>Sarai, High Priestess of Ur: the Journey - R. E. Joyce</title>
      <meta name="description" content="If you enjoyed The Red Tent you will likely also enjoy Sarai, High Priestess of Ur, as this story unfolds the hidden early life of the first matriarch of Genesis and her journey towards her destiny. The Bible defines Sarah as the obedient wife of the Patriarch Abraham. The jewish priests who wrote Genesis more than a thousand years after Sarah allegedly lived defined her role for her in accordance with their beliefs. But some scholars believe that Sarah was a priestess, not only a priestess but a high priestess serving the Goddess Inanna in the temple at Ur. This novel presents Sarah as the High Priestess who celebrates the Sacred Marriage ritual with kings and pharaohs to confirm their right to rule. But an adventurous journey begins when Sarah rejects the &quot;sacred&quot; laws of Ur&#39;s priesthood and she must flee for her life!" />
