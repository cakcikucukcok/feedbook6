It begins on a street corner where five of the main characters are waiting to be picked up for a construction job. It spirals out of control on their third day at work when the white daughters of the general contractor&#39;s make a frivolous play for one of the black laborers, which ends up with them, their fathers and four of the laborers in a courtroom, in which justice becomes secondary to the societal pressures of an all-white jury, in 1968, trying two black laborers, one who is an escaped-felon, on a trumped-up charge that ruins more lives than just those who end up in prison." />
