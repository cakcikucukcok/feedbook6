  <title>The Hi-Jack of the Trump “Princess” - Capt. Gardner Martin Kelley</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Synopsis 
&lt;p&gt;
The captain was an author of several sea stories of adventures since his birth at sea. He had been born on the two mast schooner the LIZZIE MAE while she was hove to in a bad winter storm, around Boon Island Lighthouse.
&lt;p&gt;   
Now with recall he was ready to use his experienced for a new caper. With so many boats being stolen from Floridas ports going to Cuba and Mexico, it seemed that all one had to do was steal a sport fishing boat. While after a bribe to officials another charter boat was in business. 
&lt;p&gt;
If some person stole a loaf of bread to feed a hungry child he was a thief; if someone stole big he was considered to be smart. The captain decided he would think big. He would use his experience to hi-jack a big yacht. One he had just read about in the newspaper. She lay exposed at her dock site opposite the owners casino.
&lt;p&gt;
The PRINCESS seizure was completed and now was offshore of Atlantic City. The problem was to keep her from being seen and the pirates caught. The older captain used all of his experiences of a lifetime at sea. He confused his pursuers with several divisionary course directions. The deal was completed to return the PRINCESS to the owner.  No! A last minute double cross killed the deal.
&lt;p&gt;
                                             Part 2
&lt;p&gt;
The PRINCESS was off on a cruise to the Far East, to be delivered to an oil rich sheik. The captain and his pirate crew were off for another dangerous cruise.
&lt;p&gt;
The transfer of the big yacht was completed. The successful pirate crew now no longer identified as pirates was free to return home. They had their stashed aboard loot to incriminate them, one last cruise to finalize the venture.&lt;b&gt;" />
