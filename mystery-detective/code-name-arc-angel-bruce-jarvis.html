  <title>Code Name Arc Angel - Bruce Jarvis</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;It is 1940 and Europe is in crisis. Adolph Hitler is leading Germany, the Italians have declared war on Great Britain and France, and the Luftwaffe is attacking Great Britain. Carlton Fuller, a husband, father, lawyer, and common citizen of the United States, is going about his day in Cleveland when he receives a strange phone call from General William Donovan, future director of the Office of Strategic Services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Donovan reveals he is interested in Fuller because of his German background, it is not until nearly a year later when he manages to recruit Fuller into one of the most complex and dangerous spy missions of World War II. When Fuller takes his place as an embedded spy, he steps into his role as a highly placed Nazi Colonel who plans armed services operations and interacts with Hitler, Himmler, Jodl, Gobbles, and their staffs. As he attempts to fulfill his mission gathering military secrets for the allies, Fuller puts everything on the line for the sake of destroying Hitlers regime. Now only time will tell if he will become one of the unsung heroes of the war or lose his life in the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this compelling thriller based on a true story, an American citizen turned spy must do everything in his power to stop a cycle of dark events before more innocent civilians die at the hands of a megalomaniac devil.&lt;/p&gt;" />
