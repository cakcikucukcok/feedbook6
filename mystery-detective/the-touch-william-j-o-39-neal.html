  <title>The Touch - William J. O&#39;Neal</title>
      <meta name="description" content="SLESGE BOLTON has powers that he didn&#39;t understand!
Then he met Cathy and his whole world began to explode
about him. Cathy told him about the council and the living
blood that they both carried. She told him the Navaho revered
him and considered him a God. Only after visiting the secret
place with the tribal elder and attending the council of the
chiefs he realized his life would never be the same.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Could he be this Kuno and take on a quest of the unknown
danger? Were the protectors within the council strong enough
to take on the secret commission that was seeking to rule the
world? Could the council&#39;s friend in high government places
survive? Were his gifts of wonder enough to escape the hands
of defeat?
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
A hundred questions loomed before him and he realized that
each must be dealt with and each must be solved.
&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;
The elder had told him that the epic battle between Kuno and
the evil one would be fought high in the mountains and that
only one would enter the 1000 years of peace." />
