  <title>The Deadly Dance - M. C. Beaton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Deadly Dance &lt;/i&gt;continues the tradition in M. C. Beaton&#39;s beloved Agatha Raisin mystery series--now a hit show on Acorn TV and public television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bossy, impulsive, and unlucky in love, the all-too-human Agatha Raisin has proved to be a surprisingly effective---and endearing---amateur sleuth. But can Agatha make it as a private investigator? After getting mugged on vacation, in what she will always think of as the Paris Incident, she decides to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agatha soon learns that running her own detective agency in the Cotswolds is not quite like starring in a Raymond Chandler movie. Instead of dames in distress with big shoulder pads, her clients are ladies with missing cats and a man whose son has run off with his car. Agatha even worries that she might be outclassed by her sixty-seven-year-old secretary, Emma Comfrey.&lt;br&gt;But then wealthy divorcée Catherine Laggat-Brown walks in with their first &quot;real&quot; case. Mrs. Laggat-Brown&#39;s daughter has received a death threat, and when Agatha thwarts an attack on the girl at a dinner dance, she recognizes an opportunity to show what Raisin Investigations can do. Even better, the case gives her a chance to reunite with her long-absent friend, Sir Charles Fraith. As they scour the Cotswolds in search of leads, Charles&#39; insights prove invaluable and his charms irresistible, leading poor Emma to fall madly in love with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As ever, Agatha bumbles her way through the case, trying her friends&#39; patience and flirting shamelessly with the chief suspect. Will she put her tiny agency on the map, or has even the outrageous Agatha finally bitten off more than she can chew?&lt;/p&gt;" />
