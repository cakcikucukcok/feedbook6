  <title>Deadly Silence - Rebecca Zanetti</title>
      <meta name="description" content="DON&#39;T LOOK BACK &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Under siege. That&#39;s how Ryker Jones feels. The Lost Bastards Investigative Agency he opened up with his blood brothers has lost a client in a brutal way. The past he can&#39;t outrun is resurfacing, threatening to drag him down in the undertow. And the beautiful woman he&#39;s been trying to keep at arm&#39;s length is in danger...and he&#39;ll destroy anything and anyone to keep her safe. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Paralegal Zara Remington is in over her head. She&#39;s making risky moves at work by day and indulging in an affair with a darkly dangerous PI by night. There&#39;s a lot Ryker isn&#39;t telling her and the more she uncovers, the less she wants to know. But when all hell breaks loose, Ryker may be the only one to save her. If his past doesn&#39;t catch up to them first... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Full of twists and turns you won&#39;t see coming, &lt;i&gt;Deadly Silence&lt;/i&gt; is &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Rebecca Zanetti at her suspenseful best. Fans of &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestsellers Maya Banks, Lisa Gardner, and Lisa Jackson will love &lt;i&gt;Deadly Silence&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  RT Book Reviews Readers&#39; Choice Award Winner!" />
