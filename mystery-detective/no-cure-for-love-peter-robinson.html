  <title>No Cure for Love - Peter Robinson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Featuring a foreword by Michael Connelly, this relentlessly suspenseful thriller from the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; bestselling and Edgar award-winning author of the Inspector Banks novels marks the first time that Peter Robinson has set a novel in America.&amp;#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Broughton has come a long way. She&amp;#8217;s the star of a hit cop show on TV. She lives in a beautiful California beach house. And&amp;#8212;most importantly&amp;#8212;she&amp;#8217;s put her dark past behind her&amp;#8230; as well as her old name, Sally Bolton. No need for anyone to know about that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sarah begins receiving letters mysteriously signed with the letter &amp;#8220;M,&amp;#8221; she thinks they&amp;#8217;re from a harmless admirer&amp;#8230; until her real name appears in the third letter. And then she finds that name inscribed in the sand near her home &amp;#8211; next to a body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The message is clear: Someone is watching Sarah&amp;#8217;s every move. Someone so obsessed with her that he won&amp;#8217;t stop at just one murder in order to prove his love.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panicked, Sarah turns to Detective Arvo Hughes of the LAPD, a man who specializes in hunting down the most dangerous stalkers. But nothing in Hughes&amp;#8217; experience has prepared him for the mastermind he&amp;#8217;s up against. For the killer, there&amp;#8217;s no cure for love. And for Sarah and Hughes, there&amp;#8217;s no way out.&lt;/p&gt;" />
