  <title>Brown-Eyed Girl - Virginia Swift</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sally Alder is a couple of ears past her wild youth as the hard-drinking, guitar playing, hell-raising singer known as Mustang Sally. But then she&#39;s grown with age, She&#39;s wiser and more coolheaded now, and, more important, Sally has learned how to keep a secret. It&#39;s a good thing, too, because she&#39;s going to need every advantage she&#39;s gained in order to handle the job she&#39;s just taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine having to move from LA to Laramie to get a thrill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A professor of history at UCLA, Sally has just been offered the hugely endowed and deliciously secretive Dunwoodie Distinguished Chair in American Women&#39;s History at the University of Wyoming. Job description: Move into the late Meg Dunwoodie&#39;s posh residence in Laramie (the only one of its kind) and, with sole proprietors of her papers, construct the definitive Meg Dunwoodie biography--without telling anyone anything about it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sally Alder is a couple of ears past her wild youth as the hard-drinking, guitar playing, hell-raising singer known as Mustang Sally.

Oneway or another, most of Laramie is determined to getinto Meg Dunwoodie&#39;s house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are break-ins, a curious sheriff, gossipy friends, and avaricious faculty at the university. And, if that isn&#39;t enough to distract Sally from her research, sexy Hawk Green has shown up to rekindle a romance Sally thought was gone forever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But all this goes deeper and the stakes are higher thanSally could have imagined. As she delves intoMeg&#39;s romantic and heartbreaking past as a foreigncorrespondent in Paris during World War II, the forces of good and evil are aligning in Laramie, and Sally realizes that, truly, those who don&#39;t learn from their pasts are doomed to repeat it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the tradition, of Susan Isaacs and Fannie Flagg, Virginia Swift has written a story that breaks the mold, with a cast of finely drawn characters and a heroine whose wit and intelligence are matched only by herdetermination.&lt;/p&gt;" />
