      <meta name="description" content="&quot;You should have worked out by now that nobody wants this case solved!&quot; These words, delivered by Eddie, a Liverpool thug brought down to London especially to put the frighteners on him, send a shiver down newly-promoted DS Charlie Woodend&#39;s spine. Because Eddie is right. Nobody does seem interested in bringing the killer of sixteen-year-old Pearl Jones to justice. Not DCI Bentley, Woodend&#39;s immediate boss. Not Deputy Commissioner Naylor, whose word is law in Scotland Yard. Not even the dead girl&#39;s mother herself.But Woodend cares. Working alone - sifting through the rubble of bombed-out post-war London and building up a picture of a life cut short - he is assailed by a growing anger and a deepening sorrow. He will find the murderer, he promises himself, even if that means putting his career - and perhaps even his own life - on the line." />
