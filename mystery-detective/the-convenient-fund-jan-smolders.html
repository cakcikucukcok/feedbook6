  <title>The Convenient Fund - Jan Smolders</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In the El Choc region on the Colombian Pacific Coast, there are no roads; the mud is treacherous, and humidity hangs thick in the air. In a tiny village
on the fringe of a jungle infested with drugs and terrorism, young Gloria Romero works tirelessly to protect the fishermen and their families from
crime, violence, and poverty. As she continues her humanitarian mission for mining mogul Nate Silverman through the Futuro Fund of the United States, Gloria knows that the secret she protects is safefor now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Gloria continues her life in an unpredictable and often chaotic environment, she soon hears from her boss and love interest, Marcos, that
others think her work is less than adequate. But just as Gloria begins to create a creative plan that she hopes will fix everything, she begins to receive
phone calls from Louis Durant, an old flame living in Haiti. As her romantic pursuits clash with hidden interests inside and outside her own organization,
Glorias reactions set a violent chain of events into motion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this dramatic tale of devious conspiracy, a passionate entrepreneur must risk her life, future, and love in the steamy jungles and fishing villages on the Pacific Coasts of Colombia where terrorists roam free to inflict havoc on innocent victims.&lt;/p&gt;" />
