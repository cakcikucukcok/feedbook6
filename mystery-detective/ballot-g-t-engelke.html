  <title>Ballot - G. T. Engelke</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P align=JUSTIFY&gt;Once again Detective William H. Ryan is called upon to pull together a task force to solve multiple murders that span a two-state area. The murders are in Long Island and also spread across the boroughs of New York City.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=JUSTIFY&gt;Many of Ryans family, in and out of Organized Crime, are drawn into the quest for the killer or killers, who seem to follow no rhyme or reason in selection of the victims. Each victim is brutally killed, in a sadistic and senseless way. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=JUSTIFY&gt;The involvement, and unknown inter-workings, of organized crime interwoven with a hard working Detective Division, of a big city police force working with members of much smaller local police departments offer some level of understanding of the complexities of finding the guilty party. It also shows that finding is not always enough.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=JUSTIFY&gt;The investigation uncovers the sickness of a mind and the ease that anyone may be touched by its owner. &lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P align=JUSTIFY&gt;We are all vulnerable and accessible, no matter how secure we may feel.&lt;/P&gt;" />
