  <title>Coffin Knows the Answer - Gwendoline Butler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;With his wife, the acclaimed actress Stella Pinero, away on a movie shoot in Scotland, Chief Commander John Coffin is at a bit of a loose end with just the cat and dog for company. But one morning, as he checks through the mail for his wife, he gets a rather unpleasant surprise: horrific pictures of badly abused children sent anonymously to Stella. Rather than worry his wife, he vows to track down the culprit and calls in a trusted colleague, DCI Phoebe Astley, to assist him in his inquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As they investigate Stella&#39;s stalker, another serious problem faces the detectives of the Second City of London. Several young girls have been murdered in Spinnergate with distinct and brutal similarities between the cases. Is there a serial killer on the loose? What is the connection to Stella Pinero, or is it all coincidence? As the investigations get closer to each other in focus, Coffin starts to feel that there are very personal motives at play as his wife&#39;s tormentor racks up the tension. When excavations near St Luke&#39;s unearth a chilling secret buried in the grounds of Stella&#39;s theater, John feels the net closing around those nearest to him and must act quickly or risk losing all that he holds dear.&lt;br&gt;A gripping exploration of hidden desires and terrors, &lt;i&gt;Coffin Knows the Answer&lt;/i&gt; poses some disturbing questions about identity and relationships in the modern world.&lt;/p&gt;" />
