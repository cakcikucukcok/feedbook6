  <title>Gone Astray - Raymond Cox</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Father Ted Caldwell, Rector of St. Christopher&#39;s, an inner-city parish in Connecticut, has helped his parishioners by investigating many problems they have experienced. But when Sandra Mahoney, a woman with whom he has gone through previous clashes, asks him to search for her missing daughter, Rachel, he is reluctant to take on the project. Rachel, a massage therapist, disappeared three months earlier after a bizarre murder of one of her clients.&lt;p&gt; 
Police have reached a dead-end in the case, and Father Ted does not feel he can shed any light on Rachel&#39;s whereabouts. However, the compassion he feels for Ms. Mahoney, who is agonizing over the disappearance of her child, slowly draws him into the situation. The police lieutenant investigating the homicide shares inside information with the priest, and with the involvement of his aunt Kate, Father Ted enters into a full-blown investigation.&lt;p&gt;
Father Ted finds himself involved in a series of frightening events, culminating in a tragedy that brings his efforts to an end. However, after receiving more important information, he reluctantly resumes his investigation. Circumstances spiral out of control with explosive results, revealing the truth behind Rachel&#39;s disappearance and her client&#39;s murder.&lt;p&gt;" />
