  <title>The Dean&#39;s Murders: a Four Corners Mystery - Hp Hanson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;H4&gt;Dean Harold Weathers has two problems. Someone killed his star chemistry professor, in his laboratory right on campus, no less, after filling his nose up with cocaine. To make matters worse, the suspect list includes Weathers&#39; boss, Provost John Martin, and Professor Linda Harmon, chair of the chemistry department. &lt;P&gt;
Weathers finds a silver lining, however, when it becomes clear that Lieutenant Annette Trieri, head of the investigations unit of the Durango Police Department, seems as interested in him as he is in her. &lt;P&gt;
But this mutual interest is misunderstood by whoever killed the professor, because now they are trying to kill Weathers, and, for good measure, Trieri as well. Together, the couple manages to stay alive while unraveling the chemistry professor&#39;s murder and uncovering a second, more sinister killing to which Weathers is also connected. Campus politics and drug money are a lethal combination in &lt;EM&gt;The Dean&#39;s Murders&lt;/EM&gt;." />
