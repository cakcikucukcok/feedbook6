  <title>Padre Salas - Enrique Laso</title>
      <meta name="description" content="This is the story of Padre Salas, the most charismatic character from the bestselling novel Hell Calling, which dazzled thousands of readers across the globe, and has recently been adapted for cinema by Luis Endera. In this prequel, we discover what caused Padre Salas’ flight from Mexico, leading to his taking refuge in Madrid. We will encounter the terrifying cases of multiple possessions of several girls in towns and villages around Guadalajara (Mexico). This is a novel filled with moments of excitement, tension, and no shortage of fear, guaranteed to captivate all those who love the genre.&lt;br/&gt;
Extract from Chapter 1:&lt;br/&gt;
The girl had spent the entire night howling. It was a visceral noise, more commonly associated with a wild animal, than the gaunt, virtually emaciated body of a little girl, who was barely ten years old.&lt;br/&gt;
She lay curled up on a rough bed, which had been thrown together out of lumpy sacks of hay. Her parents, more out of desperation than resentment or fear, had confined her to a shed, which they used mainly for keeping the rain off the farming tools, and for storing a few low-value belongings that they had inherited over the years from different family members.&lt;br/&gt;
The doctor approached the child with apprehension; she seemed to be sleeping, although her breathing was broken by a constant shaking that was not of human origin.&lt;br/&gt;
            “How many days has she been lying in this state?”&lt;br/&gt;
            “A… a week…” the mother dared to say, certain that she was about to receive an immediate reprimand from the doctor.&lt;br/&gt;
The doctor heaved a sigh of resignation and, picking up the girl’s hand, he tried to measure her pulse. He felt a shiver run down his spine as he noticed that her heart was hardly beating at all… little more than 20 beats per minute! It was completely impossible.&lt;br/&gt;" />
