      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Jessica Mayhew is a sharp, successful therapist with a thriving practice and loving family. But the arrival of a new client, actor Gwydion Morgan, coincides with a turbulent moment in her life: her husband has just confessed to a one-night stand with a younger woman. The son of a famous stage director, Gwydion is good-looking and talented but mentally fragile, tormented by an intriguing phobia. When Jessica receives a frantic call warning that he is suicidal, she decides to make a house call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Morgans live in a grand clifftop mansion overlooking the rocky Welsh coast. It seems to be a remote paradise, but there&#39;s something sinister about it too: Jessica learns that the family&#39;s former au pair drowned in the bay under mysterious circumstances. In her quest to help Gwydion, to whom she&#39;s grown increasingly attached, Jessica becomes ensnared in the Morgan family mystery, which soon becomes an explosive public scandal&amp;#8212;one that puts her directly in harm&#39;s way. Meanwhile, Jessica is doing her best to keep her marriage and family together, but her growing attraction to Gwydion is impossible to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smart, stylish, and suspenseful, &lt;em&gt;The House on the Cliff&lt;/em&gt; announces the arrival of a winning female protagonist in Jessica Mayhew and an exciting new crime writer in Charlotte Williams.&lt;/p&gt;" />
