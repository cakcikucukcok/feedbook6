  <title>Death of the Party - Carolyn Hart</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Britt Barlow is certain her media mogul brother-in-law Jeremiah Addison&#39;s fatal tumble a year ago was no accident -- especially since she herself discovered, and disposed of, the trip wire someone had strung across the stairs. Now she&#39;s bringing all who were in attendance that weekend back to Golden Silk -- Addison&#39;s luxurious secluded island estate -- and inviting two extra guests, Annie and Max Darling, to help uncover a killer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annie Darling wouldn&#39;t miss this party for the world! And there certainly is no lack of suspects among the guests, each of whom had a substantial motive for doing in the insufferable tycoon. But the party turns deadly when a houseman mysteriously vanishes, along with the boats which are the only escape off Addison&#39;s island -- leaving the Darlings stranded on a floating rock in the middle of nowhere, too close to a solution for comfort, and stalked by a crafty murderer.&lt;/p&gt;" />
