  <title>Revenge - John Andes</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Tony Sattill has retired a Captain from the NYPD Manhattan Crime Analysis Team (CAT).  He lives well with his wife, Melissa, and their three children in the penthouse of his wife&#39;s former husband.  He lectures on the value of CAT to out-of-town police departments.  With the killing of a former CAT member, Tony jumps back into his familiar aggressive police mode.  Over the course of the next weeks, there are several seemingly unrelated murders.  Working with the remaining members of his CAT, Tony connects the dots.  The Archangels Motorcycle Club and four paroled Ethiopians are visible elements of a criminal cabal.  Tony requests of the NYPD that he be the &quot;go to guy&quot; in determining the goal of this complex and violent group.  In his ego-driven quest, he receives help from Paul Tybor, who works from the shadows. Tony&#39;s two sons and daughter are growing up as evidence by their school activities.  The closer Tony gets to the truth about the cabal, the more violence rains.  Starting with a massive fire fight in the Colorado desert, this violence culminates in the kidnapping of his children.  He attempts to rescue them, but with chilling results.&lt;/P&gt;" />
