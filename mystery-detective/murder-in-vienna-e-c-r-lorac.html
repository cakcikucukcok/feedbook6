  <title>Murder in Vienna - E.C.R. Lorac</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Superintendent Macdonald, C.I.D., studied his fellow-passengers on the Vienna plane simply because he couldn&amp;rsquo;t help it, because he hadn&amp;rsquo;t conditioned himself to being on holiday. The distinguished industrialist he recognised: the stout man he put down (quite mistakenly) as a traveller in whisky. The fair girl was going to a job (he was right there) and the aggressive young man in the camel coat might be something bookish. Macdonald turned away from his fellow-passengers deliberately; they weren&amp;rsquo;t his business, he was on holiday - or so he thought.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Against the background of beautiful Vienna, with its enchanting palaces and gardens, its disenchanted back-streets and derelicts of war, E. C. R. Lorac constructs another great detective story with all its complexities, an exciting and puzzling crime story." />
