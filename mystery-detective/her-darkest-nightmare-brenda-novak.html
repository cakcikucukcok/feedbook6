  <title>Her Darkest Nightmare - Brenda Novak</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;i&gt;Her Darkest Nightmare&lt;/i&gt;, first in an electrifying new series from &lt;i&gt;New York Times &lt;/i&gt;bestselling author Brenda Novak&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;THE HUNT FOR A SERIAL KILLER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evelyn Talbot knows that a psychopath can look perfectly normal. She was only sixteen when her own boyfriend Jasper imprisoned and tortured her--and left her for dead. Now an eminent psychiatrist who specializes in the criminal mind, Evelyn is the force behind Hanover House, a maximum-security facility located in a small Alaskan town. Her job puts her at odds with Sergeant Amarok, who is convinced that Hanover is a threat to his community...even as his attraction to beautiful Evelyn threatens to tear his world apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;BEGINS WITH AN ESCAPE FROM HER PAST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then, just as the bitter Alaskan winter cuts both town and prison off from the outside world, the mutilated body of a local woman turns up. For Amarok, this is the final proof he needs: Hanover has to go. Evelyn, though, has reason to fear that the crime is a personal message to her--the first sign that the killer who haunts her dreams has found her again. . .and that the life she has so carefully rebuilt will never be the same...  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&quot;Brenda Novak&#39;s seamless plotting, emotional intensity, and true-to-life characters...make her books completely satisfying.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; bestselling author Allison Brennan&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;" />
