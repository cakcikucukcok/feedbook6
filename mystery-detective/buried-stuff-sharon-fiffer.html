  <title>Buried Stuff - Sharon Fiffer</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;An avid antique collector, Jane Wheel owns a lot of stuff.  In fact, she owns too much stuff, which often gets her into trouble.  So finally she agrees to do the unthinkable: she holds her very first garage sale.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thankfully the sale ends almost before it begins, interrupted by a hysterical phone call from Jane&#39;s mother, Nellie.  But Jane&#39;s relief doesn&#39;t last long.  Nellie is calling to tell Jane about a mysterious discovery on a neighbor&#39;s property:  bone fragments, buried in his backyard.  Since Jane&#39;s husband, Charlie, is a geologist, Jane volunteers to make the trip to her hometown, Kankakee, Illinois, to see if they can help her parents&#39; neighbor, Fuzzy Neilson, sort things out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When they arrive, Jane and Charlie are surprised to find quite a controversy brewing in town, and not just over the mysterious discovery of the bones.  In addition to Fuzzy&#39;s buried treasure, people are trying to reinvent this sleepy midwestern town.  There are a couple of slick real estate developers going around town talking a big game about making Kankakee into Hometown, U.S.A.  Then Jane&#39;s best friend, Tim, gets in on the act, proposing that Kankakee host the World&#39;s Largest Garage Sale.  But when a man turns up murdered on Fuzzy&#39;s field, the spotlight turns back to the mysterious doings on the Neilson farm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Charlie uncovers what may or may not be an archaelogically significant site, Jane manages to uncover the town&#39;s buried secrets.  With the help of her family, Tim, and sometime partner P.I. Bruce Oh, Jane must sort rumor and gossip from the true crimes before it&#39;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;i&gt;Buried Stuff,&lt;/i&gt; Sharon Fiffer continues to chronicle the events in the life of her charming, human, slightly obsessive main character, Jane Wheel; intriguing, suspenseful and lively, like the best of mystery writing today, reading Fiffer&#39;s latest novel is like coming across one of Jane&#39;s estate sale discoveries and finding it full of delights and surprises.&lt;/p&gt;" />
