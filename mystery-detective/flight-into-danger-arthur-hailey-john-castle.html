  <title>Flight into Danger - Arthur Hailey, John Castle</title>
      <meta name="description" content="George Spencer, a trouble-shooter, found himself in the last available seat on a charter flight out of Winnipeg airport. The other passengers were ordinary people travelling to a baseball game, the crew were well-trained and the aircraft was the type of luxury airliner to be found at any airport. Local ground fog delayed their departure but there was nothing alarming in that. It was only as they approached the end of the flight, nearing Vancouver, that things began to happen. The reader is swept along with the nerve-wracking tension of the emergency that unfolds four miles above the earth as the flight crew struggle to ensure the survival of their passengers." />
