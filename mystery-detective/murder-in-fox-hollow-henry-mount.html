  <title>Murder in Fox Hollow - Henry Mount</title>
      <meta name="description" content="In October 2008 in the quiet town Lincoln, Nebraska, nothing seems out of the ordinaryuntil ten-year-old Sue Milan suddenly disappears from a football party full of guests who all know each other. When her body is discovered near Antelope Creek the next morning, the town is thrown into an uproar, and everyone wants answers to the same question: Who killed Sue Milan?
Local police waste no time in making the Milan murder a priority case, but all they have to go on is that the little girl was last seen eating pizza during halftime with a group of other children. Without a motive for the killing, police inspector Pete Jackson is desperate for leads and discreetly calls on his longtime friend and private investigator, Harold Marlow, to help solve the case. As Marlows investigation leads him to surmise that something was amiss between Sue and another member of the gathering, the police suddenly crack the case.
But lingering doubts about the true killer remain in Marlows psyche, and he soon realizes that it is up to him to solve one of the most important crimes in the history of Nebraskabefore a child molester can once again impose his wrath on an innocent victim." />
