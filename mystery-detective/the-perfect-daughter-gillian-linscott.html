  <title>The Perfect Daughter - Gillian Linscott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Verona North had seemed the perfect daughter. She&#39;d surprised her friends by leaving her home to attend art school in London, but they&#39;d thought it was a normal, youthful rebellion which wouldn&#39;t last very long. However, when she did return home in the summer of 1914, it was to die--pregnant and with her body full of morphine. Her cousin, Nell Bray, isn&#39;t wholly convinced she committed suicide and is positive she was not an addict. Unable to suppress her curiosity, Nell discovers that her cousin was leading a double life--on the one hand, consorting with a group of Bohemian artists and anarchists, and on the other, collecting information on the suspected &quot;enemies of the state&quot; for the secret service. But where did Verona&#39;s loyalty lie? with her family, her friends or her paymasters? What did she know that caused one of them to kill her, and who was the father of her child?&lt;/p&gt;" />
