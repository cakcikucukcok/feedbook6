  <title>Tenure Blues: a Soap Opera - Frederic White</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;P&gt;Sex, Money, Bad Faith,Laughter, Power Struggles, Betrayal, Politics and even death -- in a law school. Who Knew?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Three bright young professors all vie for promotion and tenure at a law school. Not unusual, except all three have secrets that could threaten their careers as well as their personal lives.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;One, a seemingly happily married father of two, is plagued by the fear that his long-ago brief affair with the dean&#39;s son will be discovered. Now the dean&#39;s son has returned home and threatens to expose him. Another, a single black female, is having a torrid affair with the president of the university board of trustees. Complicating matters is his wife&#39;s suspicions, his quest to be the next governor of the state and the dean&#39;s son&#39;s possible knowledge of his infidelity. The third candidate is a married woman desperately trying to escape her blue collar past. When her long-estranged husband shows up on the scene to threaten trouble, the situation gets complicated, especially since the dean&#39;s mean-spirited son begins to torment her about her past. Suddenly, the dean&#39;s son winds up dead. Who&#39;s to blame? &lt;/P&gt;
