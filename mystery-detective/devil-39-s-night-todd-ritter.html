  <title>Devil&#39;s Night - Todd Ritter</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Two things Perry Hollow Police Chief Kat Campbell never thought she would do again: Enter a burning building, and lay eyes on Henry Goll, the man who was trapped inside with her the last time she was in one. So Kat&#39;s on high alert when, barely a year after the dust settled around the Grim Reaper killings, both happen on the same day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She&#39;s jolted awake at 1a.m. by a desperate phone call telling her Perry Hollow&#39;s one and only museum--home to all the town&#39;s historical artifacts--has been set on fire. Arriving at the scene, Kat catches just a glimpse of Henry&#39;s face among the crowd before she&#39;s rushed into the charred building, only to find the museum curator dead...bludgeoned, not burned. Kat has lived through some tense moments and seen some gruesome crimes, but the next twenty-four hours will be the most dangerous of her life as she and Henry seek out a killer and the motivation behind these terrifying crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd Ritter returns to the beloved town of Perry Hollow, Pennsylvania with &lt;i&gt;Devil&#39;s Night&lt;/i&gt;, his most poignant, cleverly plotted novel yet.&lt;/p&gt;" />
