  <title>The Birthing House - Christopher Ransom</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;It was expecting them.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conrad and Joanna Harrison, a young couple from Los Angeles, attempt to save their marriage by leaving the pressures of the city to start anew in a quiet, rural setting.  They buy a Victorian mansion that once served as a haven for unwed mothers, called a birthing house.  One day when Joanna is away, the previous owner visits Conrad to bequeath a vital piece of the house&#39;s historic heritage, a photo album that he claims &quot;belongs to the house.&quot;  Thumbing through the old, sepia-colored photographs of midwives and fearful, unhappily pregnant girls in their starched, nineteenth-century dresses, Conrad is suddenly chilled to the bone: staring back at him with a countenance of hatred and rage is the image of his own wife....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;            Thus begins a story of possession, sexual obsession, and, ultimately, murder, as a centuries-old crime is reenacted in the present, turning Conrad and Joanna&#39;s American dream into a relentless nightmare. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;            An extraordinary marriage of supernatural thrills and exquisite psychological suspense, &lt;i&gt;The Birthing House &lt;/i&gt;marks the debut of a writer whose first novel is a terrifying tour de force.&lt;/p&gt;" />
