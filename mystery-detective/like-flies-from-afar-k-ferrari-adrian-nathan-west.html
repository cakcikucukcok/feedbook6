  <title>Like Flies from Afar - K. Ferrari, Adrian Nathan West</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;This novel should come not with blurbs but with a hazardous-material warning: &lt;i&gt;There&#39;s bone and gristle here, be ready for that taste in your mouth you can&#39;t spit out&lt;/i&gt;.  First words to last, it&#39;s strong stuff.&quot; --James Sallis, author of &lt;i&gt;Drive&lt;/i&gt;   &lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first novel to appear in English by the &quot;subway janitor by night, novelist by day,&quot; who began his writing career while an undocumented immigrant in the United States, &lt;i&gt;Like Flies from Afar &lt;/i&gt;will demonstrate why K. Ferrari is already an award-winning star of international crime fiction. A hardboiled noir thriller, a whodunit, a black comedy, and a filthy catalog of the excesses of wealth, this is a Jim Thompson novel for the globalized world.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr. Luis Machi is an unforgettably loathsome and hilarious Argentinian oligarch who made his fortune collaborating with the worst elements of society--parasites, pushers, and secret policemen. He has a cocaine habit, a collection of three hundred ties, ten million dollars in the bank, and a bloody corpse in the trunk of his BMW . . . but as far as the body goes, he&#39;s completely innocent. He has no idea who the victim could be, or who among his many, many enemies might be trying to frame him for murder, and he doesn&#39;t have much time to find out . . . &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The profane and uproarious &lt;i&gt;Like Flies from Afar&lt;/i&gt; follows Machi through twenty-four hours of his eventful life--one full day in which to solve this mystery, or at least to make sure he isn&#39;t the one to take the fall.&lt;/p&gt;" />
