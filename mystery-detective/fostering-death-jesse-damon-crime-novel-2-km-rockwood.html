  <title>Fostering Death: Jesse Damon Crime Novel #2 - KM Rockwood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Jesse Damon has spent most of the last twenty years in prison on a murder conviction. Now paroled, he&#39;s trying to beat the odds and walk the straight-and-narrow with a pair of overactive cops watching him for mistakes. He&#39;s got a one-room apartment, a job working the overnight shift at a factory, and a sometimes girlfriend named Kelly. If he can just stay out of trouble, he may even be able to join the union.&lt;P&gt; But when he pays his last respects to Mrs. Coleman, his foster mother, he discovers her death is being investigated as a murder. And he&#39;s the prime suspect.&lt;P&gt; Jesse&#39;s life is getting complicated fast, with a group of religious fanatics in saffron robes opening a tabernacle in the abandoned pizza parlor over his apartment, problems at work, and Kelly&#39;s custody battle with her ex. It&#39;s a lot to deal with while he tries to find out who really killed Mrs. Coleman -- and get the cops off his back!" />
