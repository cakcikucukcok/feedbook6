  <title>Dog Dish of Doom - E.J. Copperman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cozy fans and animal lovers alike won&#39;t be able to keep their paws off &lt;i&gt;Dog Dish of Doom&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Laugh-out-loud funny, E.J. Copperman&#39;s series debut is &quot;lots of fun&quot; (&lt;i&gt;Library Journal, &lt;/i&gt;starred). &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kay Powell wants to find that break-out client who will become a star. And she thinks she&#39;s found him: His name is Bruno, and he has to be walked three times a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kay is the Agent to the Paws, representing showbiz clients who aren&#39;t exactly people. In fact: they&#39;re dogs. Bruno&#39;s humans, Trent and Louise, are pains in the you-know-what, and Les McMaster, the famous director mounting a revival of Annie, might not hire Bruno just because he can&#39;t stand them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This becomes less of an issue when Trent is discovered face down in Bruno&#39;s water dish, with a kitchen knife in his back. Kay&#39;s perfectly fine to let the NYPD handle the murder, but when the whole plot seems to center on Bruno, her protective instincts come into play. You can kill any people you want, but you&#39;d better leave Kay&#39;s clients alone.&lt;/p&gt;" />
