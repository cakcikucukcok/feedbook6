She was never caught, but he was the grandson of a mobster and she knows that someday this crime will catch up to her.

As a murderer, Casey isn&#39;t a good candidate, but she has something they want: She&#39;s a homicide detective, and Rockton has just had its first real murder. She and Diana are in.
