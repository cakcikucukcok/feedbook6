  <title>Corrupt Practice - Vijay Patel</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Taylor, the newly appointed General Manager of a Kenyan subsidiary of a major US pharmaceutical giant, is faced with a dilemma. The companys ethos is NOT to do any business through bribery in line with the US laws. But this conflicts with the local culture where such practices are the norm.
Taylor decides to take matters into his own hands. 
Then someone in the company blows the whistle on him, and the US auditors jump on him. What ensues is a battle of wits between the auditors and Taylor.
Taylor faces another, simultaneous, battle as well. An influential official at the ministry is murdered, and Taylor ends up as the prime suspect at the same time as the audit inquiry.
The author is one of the very few people who can make a page turning suspense out of an audit inquiry.
CORRUPT PRACTICE is a fast paced commercial thriller with lots of twists and turns.
The storyline is gripping and will have you mesmerised throughout.
A must read for all whodunit fans." />
