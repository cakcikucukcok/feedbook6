Three men have been shot, the briefcase Iversson was guarding is empty...and now he wants to know why. So begins a dangerous hunt for answers that will take him into direct conflict with Detective Sergeant John Gallan, who is investigating the mysterious death of one of Fowler&#39;s doormen, and toward a confrontation that neither is likely to escape unscathed.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Business of Dying&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cynical and jaded, Detective Sergeant Dennis Milne earns money on the side by doing what he does best: punishing the bad guys. But this time he&#39;s been duped and instead of blowing away drug dealers, he kills three innocent men, setting off a war of morality that could leave him broken, or worse...dead.&lt;/p&gt;" />
