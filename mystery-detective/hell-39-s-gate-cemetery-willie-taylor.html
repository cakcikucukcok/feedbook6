  <title>Hell&#39;s Gate Cemetery - Willie Taylor</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;Somehow, someway, we will find a way to break the curse of this world!&quot;
The struggle between good and evil is eternal. And it&#39;s about to visit a small town near Las Vegas, Nevada. 
The son of the devil has come to wage war against the human race and to bring suffering to the Earth. Known as the Beast, his plan is devious and evil, and he knows it will fulfill his fervent desire to please his father. He spreads death and destruction upon the inhabitants of Paradise, Nevada, causing fear and terror wherever he roams.
But there is a small army of supernatural protectors bent on sending the Beast back to whence he came-if they can only overcome the horrifying power that he holds.
The first in a thrilling new series, Hell&#39;s Gate Cemetery is a spine-tingling tale of the ultimate good vs. the ultimate evil in a battle that will determine the fate of the entire human race.
Angels, Demons, Daemon, Ancient curses, Earthly Deities, Supernatural Heroes &amp; Villain!  This Book has it all!  A True Horror/Sci-fi Thrill ride!" />
