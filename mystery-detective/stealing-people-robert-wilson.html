  <title>Stealing People - Robert Wilson</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;Book 3 in the Charles Boxer Series&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Charlie Boxer, an expert at solving kidnappings, and his ex-wife Detective Mercy Dunqah are tasked with taking down a bold and heartless crime syndicate responsible for the abduction of six children.&lt;br&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;br&gt; Two years after the events of &lt;i&gt;You Will Never Find Me &lt;/i&gt;(Europa, 2015), Boxer is contemplating retirement. He has found a measure of contentment even as a mystery from his own past gnaws at his sense of justice. Mercy balances a complicated personal life with an even more precarious professional one in the woefully under-resourced metropolitan police department. Both are suddenly pulled back into service when six children of wealthy families vanish, taken by a ruthlessly efficient organization with a single astonishing demand. Investigators stymied and time expiring, they seem set on a calamitous course. &lt;br&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;br&gt; Trapped, off-balance, and with little left to lose they plunge into a cauldron of warring intelligence agencies, morally destitute billionaires, and human traffickers, coming finally to a fateful Moroccan reckoning that will forever change them. &lt;br&gt; &amp;#160;&lt;br&gt; The latest entry in Robert Wilson&amp;rsquo;s acclaimed Charlie Boxer series, &lt;i&gt;Stealing People&lt;/i&gt; is both topical and thrilling. Wilson unravels a convincing web of international intrigue in a world where heroism may breed vice and virtue is an accidental byproduct of crime." />
