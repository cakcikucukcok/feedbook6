  <title>Charters and Caldicott - Stella Bingham</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Whatever happened to Charters and Caldicott, that pair of cricket-mad &#39;solemn asses&#39; from Alfred Hitchcock&#39;s classic suspense movie The Lady Vanishes? Fast forward about fifty years. The world has changed beyond recognition, but not Charters and Caldicott. A little longer in the tooth, perhaps, they remain dedicated to the manners of the old school, enjoying lunch at their gentlemen&#39;s club and afternoons watching Agatha Christie movies. They are however entirely unprepared for a whodunit of their own, when the dead body of a young woman is found in Caldicott&#39;s flat, stabbed with a Malayan paperknife. Pitched on a trail of unexplained deaths (&#39;are you keeping count of all these, Charters?&#39;) and dogged by the fastidious Inspector Snow, they attempt to unravel the mysteries around them. Why were the handbags switched? What does the cryptic message &#39;Mix Well and Serve&#39; mean? And why does the enigmatic Venables, a fellow clubman, turn up at every twist in their journey? This tale of Nazi gold, murder and deception features effervescent dialogue and delightful characters - especially the eponymous heroes, relics of an England already out-of-date by the 1930&#39;s but none the less charming for that. Charters &amp;amp;amp; Caldicott is a comical, lighthearted but lethal treat of a whodunit, in which our heroes take their responsibilities seriously - but somehow always find as much time for lunch, tea or a cocktail as they do for detective work." />
