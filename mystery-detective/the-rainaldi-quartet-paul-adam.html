  <title>The Rainaldi Quartet - Paul Adam</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Who would want to kill Tomaso Rainaldi, an elderly, unassuming violin-maker in the quiet Italian city of Cremona? For his friend and fellow violin-maker Gianni Castiglione, the murder is as mysterious as it is shocking. Rainaldi had few possessions, no enemies and little money. No one - least of all the police - can fathom a motive for murdering him. All he really had was an obsessive love of violins and an encyclopedic knowledge of them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what if he knew more than anyone else - not just about famous violins, but about missing violins? Ones of the caliber of the fabled Messiah, Stradivari&#39;s most sublime creation, the &lt;i&gt;Mona Lisa &lt;/i&gt;of the music world. A violin now in the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford - and worth millions...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aided by his friend, policeman Antonio Guastafeste, Gianni starts to investigate the dead man&#39;s affairs. Affairs that reveal an appointment in Venice with the eccentric and exceedingly rich violin-collector Enrico Forlani, and a trail that winds back to a mysterious musical past - and a far from harmonious future.&lt;br&gt;Retracing Rainaldi&#39;s steps, the two men find themselves involved in a sequence of startling events -- another murder, a mysterious Englishman, and an unscrupulous violin-dealer. A chain of events that careers across Italy and England as they become players in a game where musical instruments change hands for millions, forgery is an art form, and the preferred method of negotiation is murder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accompanied by two centuries of myth, music, and mystery, &lt;i&gt;The Rainaldi Quartet&lt;/i&gt; provides a fascinating glimpse into a closed world - played at a rhythm that is fast-paced, furious, and unforgettable.&lt;/p&gt;" />
