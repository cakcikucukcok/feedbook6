  <title>The Beginning - Fiona Donovan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="John OBryan returns in this second novel. This time, the young American contract assassin working for the CIA takes us through his initial journey into the secretive and corrupt world of intelligence. He takes us through his grueling training at the infamous Farmthe official CIA training camp. Here, he learns just what it takes to make it as an agent of the CIA.
His first assignment comes early on in his career, and we learn what its like to go from a rookie outsider to being accepted into not one but two of the most honorable brotherhood organizations in the world. His world is rocked hard by this very challenging assignment, both emotionally and psychologically as he faces the unpleasant task placed before him. 
He is then drawn into the true core of evil as he and his team members attempt to take out one of the worlds most evil terrorist groups before they can rain down destruction and devastation on an unimaginable vast international scale.
Johns journey, through this assignment, once again confronts him with light and darkness, good versus evil in the situations, and challenges that are thrown before him. We follow John in his every step as he grows and develops from a cocksure rookie who knows it all to a more mature and confident agent.
This book gives us a glimpse through the looking glass of the secrets, lies, and betrayals that occur within the CIA.
Contains strong language and gruesome details." />
