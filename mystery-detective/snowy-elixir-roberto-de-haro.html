  <title>Snowy Elixir - Roberto de Haro</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Dale Lipinski is a trained killer, ex-cop, and former Delta Force and Black Ops specialist who is now lending his talents to California Attorney General Patrick Tanner as a special assistant and senior investigator. His current order of business is to stem the flow of high-quality cocaine into California. But there is only one major problem: the vicious drug cartel he is targeting is determined not to go down without a fight.
Lipinski knows drug traffickers couldnt care less about maiming or killing people. With a tough road ahead of him, he partners with a diva-like litigator and a beautiful FBI agent and heads to the California-Mexico border. Meanwhile, although the brilliant computer hacker has just escaped being sold into white slavery, Katla Oesterhalles destiny now lies in the hands of a Latin American gangster determined to use her skills to pass on pertinent information about the cocaine syndicate. As Lipinski, his partners, and Oesterhalle embark on journeys to cripple the drug cartel, only time will tell if any will be successful enough to live to tell about it.
In this fast-paced thriller, a special investigator and his talented associates must do everything in their power to stop a dangerous cartel from smuggling dope worth billions into the United States." />
