  <title>Claire Fontaine Crime Fighter - Tracey Enright</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Novel of Life and Death...and Shoes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Claire Fontaine is sassy, sexy, sophisticated, and rich. Henry Bennett is fat, sloppy, slow, and a bad dresser. He&#39;s a private eye, and as far as he&#39;s concerned, she&#39;s his assistant. As far as she&#39;s concerned, he&#39;s her partner. Their entire relationship, in fact, is one big difference of opinion, and the results are hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now Henry has been hired to investigate the murder of a young woman who liked to party. Claire helps (or hinders, depending on your point of view) when she can drag herself away from her Brentwood mansion and the James Bond-like hunk who lives next door. As Claire and Henry try to trace the victim&#39;s last known companions, they stumble across streets that the rich and famous desperately try to hide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you like sleuths who are stylish, seductive, and full of great fun, then Claire Fontaine is the crime fighter for you.&lt;/p&gt;" />
