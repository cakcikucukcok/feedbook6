  <title>The Camilla Randall Mysteries Box Set - Anne R. Allen</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Snarky, delicious fun! The Camilla Randall mysteries are a laugh-out-loud mashup of romantic comedy, crime fiction, and satire: Dorothy Parker meets Dorothy L. Sayers. Perennially down-and-out socialite Camilla Randall is a magnet for murder, mayhem and Mr. Wrong, but she always solves the mystery in her quirky, but oh-so-polite way.&amp;nbsp; Usually with more than a little help from her gay best friend, Plantagenet Smith.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ghostwriters In The Sky&lt;/b&gt;: When a young writer is found dead in her gay best friend&amp;#39;s bed at a writer&amp;#39;s conference in California wine country, Camilla must enlist the help of a cross-dressing dominatrix to clear Plant&amp;#39;s name. Unfortunately, she suspects the hot LA cop who has stolen her heart may be the murderer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In &lt;b&gt;Sherwood Ltd&lt;/b&gt;. a homeless Camilla lands in Robin Hood country, where some not-so-merry men may be trying to kill her, and of course Camilla once again ends up in the most improbable, but always believable, circumstances.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Best Revenge &lt;/b&gt;is a prequel to the series, and takes us back to Camilla Randall&amp;#39;s teen years, when she first meets Plantagenet Smith&amp;mdash;and is accused of murder herself!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;These stories are so carefully crafted and so cleverly presented that virtually every page offers a unique insight, experience, or perspective, that grabs my attention, tickles my imagination, and makes me laugh out loud.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;A trio of light but intelligent reads. What a pleasure to spend a few days with bits of suspense, as well as some slightly ditzy but loveable characters, all tossed about together in a comical hurricane.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;Serious and absorbing plots. Lighthearted at the same time.&amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;" />
