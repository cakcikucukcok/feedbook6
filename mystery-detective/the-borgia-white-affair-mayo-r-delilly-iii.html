  <title>The Borgia White Affair - Mayo R. DeLilly Iii</title>
      <meta name="description" content="The embattled Kingsley administration is teetering on the edge of political ruin; fighting and losing an unwinnable war against drugs, and facing a tough re-election campaign. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
	In order to save his Presidency, Operation Borgia White is spawned to stem the tide of the drug scourge enveloping America. Sporadic and untimely cocaine deaths sweep across the country. The Government attempts to reassure an anxious populace and sway public opinion toward more stringent measures the Administration has planned to eradicate the drug problem once and for all.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
	Dr. Lester Phillips, a Washington, DC Pediatrician, has seen the first telltale signs of the plot; the seizures, the cardiac and respiratory arrest, the lightning fast death. With the help of his colleague, pathologist Ray Rafferty, they slowly begin to assemble and put together clues, aided by a disgruntled Justice Department official.&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
	As Lester and Ray continue to pursue the truth, dark forces within the Administration unleash attacks against the men, their families, and their reputations. After Ray is attacked and presumed dead or missing, Lester must fight alone until he is unjustly accused of crimes against the state and arrested. During his captivity, he comes face to face with the mastermind of the intricate operation. As the plot finally unfolds, Lester realizes that the deaths of thousands of people have been collateral damage, and something far more sinister is planned. Lester is able to escape his captors, but is injured. He must make his way back to Washington, DC and warn the targets of the plot before it is too late. In the balance is the fate of American way of life as we know it." />
