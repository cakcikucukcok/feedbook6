  <title>Bamboo and Blood - James Church</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;The critically acclaimed &lt;i&gt;A Corpse in the Koryo &lt;/i&gt;brought readers into the enigmatic workings of North Korean intelligence with the introduction of a new kind of detective---the mysterious Inspector O. In the follow-up, &lt;i&gt;Hidden Moon,&lt;/i&gt; O threaded his way through the minefield of North Korean ministries into a larger conspiracy he was never supposed to touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the inspector returns . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the winter of 1997, trying to stay alive during a famine that has devastated much of North Korea, Inspector O is ordered to play host to an Israeli agent who appears in Pyongyang. When the wife of a North Korean diplomat in Pakistan dies under suspicious circumstances, O is told to investigate, with a curious proviso: Don&#39;t look too closely at the details, and stay away from the question of missiles. O knows he can&#39;t avoid finding out what he is supposed to ignore on a trail that leads him from the dark, chilly rooms of Pyongyang to an abandoned secret facility deep in the countryside, guarded by a lonely general; and from the streets of New York to a bench beneath a horse chestnut tree on the shores of Lake Geneva, where the Inspector discovers he is up to his ears in missiles---and worse. Stalked by the past and wary of the future, O is convinced there is no one he can trust, and no one he can&#39;t suspect. Swiss intelligence wants him out of the country; someone else wants him dead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once again, James Church&#39;s spare, lyrical prose guides readers through an unfamiliar landscape of whispered words and shadows, a world wrapped in a level of mystery and complexity that few outsiders have experienced. With Inspector O, noir has a new home in North Korea, and James Church holds the keys.&lt;/p&gt;" />
