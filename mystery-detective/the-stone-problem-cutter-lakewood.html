  <title>The Stone Problem - Cutter Lakewood</title>
      <meta name="description" content="A carnival karaoke singer, a high-class grifter, an aging superstar, a voodoo priestess, and the Vegas mob. What could go wrong? Find out in this adventurous thrill ride, where a down-and-out carnival karaoke singer realizes his dream of becoming a star, but not in the way he imagines.
Drowning his sorrow with sour mash and sinsemilla, Chip Barnett could be found drinking and getting high on most nights in his beat-up Winnebago motor home that was cramped into a dusty fairground parking lot next to a hundred other beat-up campers. In a constant state of intoxication, he drank and did whatever drugs he could get his hands on, uppers or downers, depending on the time of day. It was the only way he could manage to cope with his miserable existence as a carnival karaoke singer.
Raul was feeling the heat from the whole mess. His people were leaning on him to fix things, and he knew what that meant. He could stay in good graces with the families, providing nothing blew back on them. Aside from the slowdown in business, no one was out any real money yet. But with Betty gone, Hal was a liability. She was a big moneymaker for a major family, and they were going to want to get paid or want retribution. Since it was Hal that brought Betty into this whole mess, hed have to take the fall. Pay your ticket or get your ticket paid out was the way of things." />
