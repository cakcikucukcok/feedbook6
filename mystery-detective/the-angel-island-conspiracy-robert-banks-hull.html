      <meta name="description" content="Two San Francisco Bay sailors, Travis and Carol, fall upon a terrorist plot to destroy a major San Francisco Bay landmark by a most ingenious method. They battle both the bad guys and the authorities in their quest to stop this horrific event from taking place. With their superb sailing skills and intimate knowledge of their beloved San Francisco Bay, they have
the advantage as they duel the bad guys from Sausalito to Alcatraz to San Pablo Bay. As they race for their lives to escape their pursuers,
they employ some very ingenious ways to foil their counterparts.&lt;p&gt;
Travis and Carol use every sailors trick and turn of the tides that San Francisco Bay has to offer as their only weapons with astonishing
success. Whether the reader is a sailor or not, the excitement and satisfaction of reading how two regular citizens can prevail against
professional evildoers is an old story but with a thrilling new twist in &lt;i&gt;The Angel Island Conspiracy.&lt;/i&gt;" />
