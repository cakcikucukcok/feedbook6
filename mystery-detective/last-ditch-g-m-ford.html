  <title>Last Ditch - G.M. Ford</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;In Leo Waterman, writer G.M. Ford has created a private detective who tackles cases armed with strong survival instincts--and a deadly sense of humor. In his fifth outing, Seattle&amp;#39;s most uncompromising sleuth finds that the laughs are all on him after making a startling discovery at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;P.I. Leo Waterman is unflappable, irrepressible and unpredictable--a guy who, when facing adversity, would rather throw a punchline than a punch. As the son of one of Seattle&amp;#39;s most colorful political figures, Leo Knows the city like no one else. Barely operating within the bothersome confines of the law, Leo manages to bend the rules via a dash of urbane charm, backed-up by a mild threat of mutual blackmail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, Leo has put aside the ghosts of his childhood to take up residence in his deceased parents&amp;#39; newly renovated mansion, which he now shares with his girlfriend, forensic specialist Rebecca Duvall. Domestic tranquility is the ideal, but this is Leo Waterman&amp;#39;s home--where a simple chore can lead to disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To clean up the neglected backyard, Leo calls upon his most trusted allies, &amp;#34;the Boys,&amp;#34; a tenacious collective of hapless barflies whose pension checks arrive care of a low-rent ginmill. but as they tear down a dilapidated greenhouse, the motley wrecking crew uncovers a human skeleton that belongs to Leo&amp;#39;s late father&amp;#39;s most despised enemey: a muck-raking, ultra-conservative journalist who vanished twenty years ago. With the evidence stacked against &amp;#34;Wild Bill&amp;#34; Waterman, his son feels compelled to clear his name by digging up the past--and trying not to get buried beneath it.&lt;/p&gt;" />
