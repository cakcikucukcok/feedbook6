  <title>Y. Cheung, Business Detective - Harry Stephen Keeler</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Young Y. Cheung is in a pickle! In order to receive a $100,000 inheritance from his grand­father’s estate, he must get his name mentioned in 1000 U.S. newspapers, “in an honorable fashion” before midnight of the day before the estate is settled. On top of that, his family doesn’t consider his one-of-a-kind profession, business detective, “honorable”. How Y. Cheung uses his inscrutable wiles to gain happiness and the inheritance is a tale only Harry Stephen Keeler could spin.
&lt;P&gt;
&quot;It was definitely loopy and is the second of his novels I have read to deal sympathetically and sensibly with Asians in 1930s while everyone else was demonizing or eroticizing them in genre fiction of that era. This is one of Keeler&#39;s forays into the &#39;locked room&#39; and impossible problem genre, but being Keller it involves an outrageous and nearly unfathomable solution.&quot; -- G. F. Norris, Golden Age Detection." />
