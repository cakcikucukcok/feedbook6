      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shoreline &lt;/i&gt;is the second suspense novel featuring FBI agent Nora Khalil by Carolyn Baugh, acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The View from Garden City.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Compelling, important, and completely engrossing--it will change the way you look at the world.&quot;--Hank Phillippi Ryan, Mary Higgins Clark Award Winning author&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officer Nora Khalil is a strong independent woman used to navigating different terrains. As an American-born Muslim, she loves her country and tries to honor the traditions of her people, but feels that she must constantly confront those who think she is alien.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assigned to the FBI office in Erie, Pennsylvania, she tries to fit into small-town America after a childhood growing up in the bustle of Philly&#39;s dark streets. A series of horrific acts of violence are committed by a well-connected group of domestic terrorists eager to spark a national revolution. The town erupts in chaos and the eyes of the nation are on these events. In turn, this heats up the debate about the fabric of our nation...and how those who feel disenfranchised by our new multiculturalism are determined to take back their birthright and, in their own words, make our nation great again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Will Nora and her team be able to defuse the situation before the carnage goes national?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the Publisher&#39;s request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.&lt;/p&gt;" />
