  <title>Introducing Agatha Raisin - M. C. Beaton</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Beloved author M. C. Beaton has delighted readers and fans alike with her Agatha Raisin mysteries. The Quiche of Death&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; and The Vicious Vet,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt; the first two books in the series, are now together for the first time in one volume. . . .&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Quiche of Death&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Putting all her eggs in one basket, Agatha Raisin gives up her successful PR firm, sells her London flat, and samples a taste of early retirement in the quiet village of Carsely. Bored, lonely, and used to getting her way, she enters a local baking contest. Despite the fact that Agatha has never baked a thing in her life, she is sure the pie she has secretly bought from an upper-crust London quicherie will make her the toast of the town. But her recipe for social advancement sours when the judge not only snubs her entry--but falls over dead! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Vicious Vet&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Agatha Raisin hasn&#39;t quite adjusted to the slow pace of village life, or to the failure of her overtures to her handsome neighbor, James Lacey. Since the new vet in town is young and good looking, Agatha&#39;s perfectly healthy tabby endures a nasty physical exam in the name of romance. Unfortunately, his sacrifice is all for naught when the vet is soon found dead. The police call the death a freak accident, but Agatha convinces James that playing amateur detective might be fun. Unfortunately, just as curiosity killed the cat, Agatha&#39;s inept snooping is soon a motivation for murder. . . .&lt;/p&gt;" />
