  <title>Beyond Faith - A.J. Villeneuve</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;From the depths of childhood trauma, Elizabeth Kinsella is rescued by Audrey and Robert Langmuir, a professional couple from Vancouver. They become her adoptive parents and provide her with the family security she craves. They encourage her to follow in their academic footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One evening, her life begins to unravel. A series of strange events endanger her life. This follows the appearance of an unusual lunar phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The release of Audreys controversial book also makes an explosive impact. It challenges conventional religious doctrines and faiths, resulting in catastrophic upheavals throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;
Audrey is forced into hiding, leaving Elizabeth to venture alone in the world, fearful of her future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As societal tensions mount, Elizabeth is targeted by a secretive fanatical cult. This group has reason to believe she has a part to play in the fulfillment of an ancient prophecy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The prophecy declares that the world is ready for the new spiritual leader, to be revealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst this background of unwanted publicity, Elizabeth is increasingly mystified by her lovers reckless behaviour. Jack Cyrus becomes obsessed with creating a godless society, which will permanently reset the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Jack engages in deception, the truth is slowly revealed. He is involved in more than mere research. His ideals have become darker and more sinister. In dealing with his betrayal, Elizabeth joins forces with his colleagues to confront him about his true intentions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Elizabeth must choose to accept his radical beliefs to keep him close, or expose his treachery to the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once she steps inside Jacks world, she must draw upon a special gift from her disturbing childhood to conquer the man with manipulative control over her destiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the world-wide spiritual phenomena climaxes, they both become entwined in an ultimate test of faith. A transformational miracle is the eventual outcome.&lt;/p&gt;" />
