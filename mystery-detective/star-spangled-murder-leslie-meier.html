  <title>Star Spangled Murder - Leslie Meier</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Lucy Stone is in the doghouse--with her next-door neighbor, Mrs. Prudence Pratt. It seems that Kudo, the Stones&#39; misbehaving mutt, has developed a taste for Mrs. Pratt&#39;s blue-ribbon winning chickens, as well an escape artist&#39;s talent for sneaking out. With the Fourth of July coming up, Lucy doesn&#39;t want to set off any more fireworks with the crabby Prudence.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Another sign that the crazy days of summer are in full swing arrives when a group of naturists--a.k.a. nudists--descends on Tinker&#39;s Cove, skinny-dipping at the pond that borders Mrs. Pratt&#39;s property, giving her something else to complain about. Worse still, the local lobstermen are upset about poachers--and suspicion falls on Mrs. Pratt&#39;s husband and son. Then the July Fourth fireworks are canceled to protect a patch of extremely rare purple-spotted lichen, and Mrs Pratt is the victim of a hit and run.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    Tinker&#39;s Cove is full of suspects, but none with so personal a motive as the Stones. Their feud with Mrs. Pratt has put them at risk of losing their freedom this Independence Day--unless Lucy can start things off with a bang by catching a red, white and blue killer.  .  .  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;b&gt;  Praise for Leslie Meier and Her Lucy Stone Mysteries  &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;     &quot;Leslie Meier writes with sparkle and warmth.&quot;  --&lt;i&gt;Chicago Sun Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &quot;Leslie Meier has created such a wonderful series, I always look forward to reading the next book, and I&#39;m never disappointed.&quot;--&lt;i&gt;I Love a Mystery&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &quot;A truly American version of the English &#39;cozy.&#39;&quot;  --&lt;i&gt;Tulsa World&lt;/i&gt;" />
