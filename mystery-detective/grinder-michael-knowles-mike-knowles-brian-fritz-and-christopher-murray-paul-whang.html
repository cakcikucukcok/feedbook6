  <title>Grinder - Michael Knowles, Mike Knowles, Brian Fritz and Christopher Murray, Paul Whang</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&quot;You brought me back into this because you know what I am. I&#39;m a grinder, I find out everything.&quot;
Bullets squared everything. Wilson left his old boss alive in exchange for a clean slate. Wilson held up his end of the bargain and stayed off the grid for two years. Two years of peace until a man came calling. The man brought a gun and a woman in his trunk. Thousands of miles from home, Wilson learns that the city doesn&#39;t let go so easily. The city is more than bricks; it is a machine running on the blood of hard men and women. The hardest man in the city remembers Wilson and he will stop at nothing to get him back.
A dangerous mobster&#39;s nephews are missing and the only suspects are his lieutenants. Wilson is pulled back to once again work under the radar - to quietly find out who is responsible, so it can be settled with screams. Wilson is back to being what he was. He&#39;s a grinder again. All bets are off and before he&#39;s done - everyone will pay." />
