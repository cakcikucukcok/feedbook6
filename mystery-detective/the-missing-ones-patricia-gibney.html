  <title>The Missing Ones - Patricia Gibney</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;b&gt;The hole they dug was not deep. A white flour bag encased the little body. Three small faces watched from the window, eyes black with terror.&lt;/b&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;The child in the middle spoke without turning his head. &amp;#x2018;I wonder which one of us will be next?&amp;#x2019;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a woman&amp;#x2019;s body is discovered in a cathedral and hours later a young man is found hanging from a tree outside his home, &lt;b&gt;Detective Lottie Parker&lt;/b&gt; is called in to lead the investigation. Both bodies have the same distinctive tattoo clumsily inscribed on their legs. It&amp;#x2019;s clear the pair are connected, but how? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trail leads &lt;b&gt;Lottie&lt;/b&gt; to St Angela&amp;#x2019;s, a former children&amp;#x2019;s home, with a dark connection to her own family history. Suddenly the case just got personal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As Lottie begins to link the current victims to unsolved murders decades old, two teenage boys go missing. She must close in on the killer before they strike again, but in doing so is she putting her own children in terrifying danger? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lottie&lt;/b&gt; is about to come face to face with a twisted soul who has a &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; warped idea of justice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fans of Rachel Abbott, Karin Slaughter and Robert Dugoni will be gripped by this page-turning serial killer thriller, guaranteed to keep you reading late into the night.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What everyone is saying about &lt;i&gt;The Missing Ones&lt;/i&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;I had been looking forward to reading this book and &lt;b&gt;I was not disappointed&lt;/b&gt;.
