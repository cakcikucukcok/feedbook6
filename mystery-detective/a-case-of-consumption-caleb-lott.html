  <title>A Case of Consumption - Caleb Lott</title>
      <meta name="description" content="Based on a bizarre murder case that occurred in south Alabama, A Case of Consumption is the story of Mark Hatchett, a private detective with a strong sense of justice who is hired by her family to locate an exotic dancer, Lisa Lemon; a country girl who lost her way.  
When she is found dead, Hatchett is paired with Jo Ward, a novice sheriffs investigator, and the two wade into a world of perversion and violence; so violent that Ward has to keep a close eye on Hatchett, lest he lose his own way. Too many suspects and too many motives must be swept away before the fateful confrontation with Lisa Lemons killer.
A Case of Consumption is a study of the conflict that occurs when justice meets the law. Sometimes its better to be right than legal." />
