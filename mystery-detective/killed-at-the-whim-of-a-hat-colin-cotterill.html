  <title>Killed at the Whim of a Hat - Colin Cotterill</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The launch of a brand new series by the internationally bestselling, critically acclaimed author of &lt;i&gt;The Coroner&#39;s Lunch&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With worldwide critical acclaim, Colin Cotterill is one of the most highly regarded &quot;cult favorite&quot; crime writers today. Now, with this new series, starting with &lt;i&gt;Killed at the Whim of a Hat&lt;/i&gt;, Cotterill is poised to break into the mainstream. Set in present day rural Thailand, Cotterill is as sharp and witty, yet more engaging and charming, than ever before. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jimm Juree was a crime reporter for the &lt;i&gt;Chiang Mai Daily Mail &lt;/i&gt;with a somewhat eccentric family--a mother who might be drifting mentally; a grandfather--a retired cop--who rarely talks; a younger brother obsessed with body-building, and a transgendered, former beauty pageant queen, former older brother. When Jimm is forced to follow her family to a rural village on the coast of Southern Thailand, she&#39;s convinced her career--maybe her life--is over. So when a van containing the skeletal remains of two hippies, one of them wearing a hat, is inexplicably unearthed in a local farmer&#39;s field, Jimm is thrilled. Shortly thereafter an abbot at a local Buddhist temple is viciously murdered, with the temple&#39;s monk and nun the only suspects. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suddenly Jimm&#39;s new life becomes somewhat more promising--and a lot more deadly. And if Jimm is to make the most of this opportunity, and unravel the mysteries that underlie these inexplicable events, it will take luck, perseverance, and the help of her entire family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of &lt;i&gt;Library Journal&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s Best Mystery Books of 2011&lt;/p&gt;" />
