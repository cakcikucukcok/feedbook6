      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did she slip through the cracks, or was she pushed?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a severed hand is found in an abandoned flat, Detective Jake Porter and his partner Nick Styles are able to DNA match the limb to the owner, Natasha Barclay, who has not been seen in decades.
