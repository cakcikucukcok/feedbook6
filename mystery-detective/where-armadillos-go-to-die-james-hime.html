  <title>Where Armadillos Go to Die - James Hime</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Sylvester Bradshaw owns the Bouree restaurant, home of the best catfish within a hundred miles of Brenham, Texas. Besides being known for his cooking and for being one of the town&#39;s nastiest residents, he also happens to have invented a machine that several venture capitalists and one former NFL star would like to invest in at almost any cost. But Bradshaw---stubborn and miserly---can&#39;t be enticed no matter what offer they put on the table. Nobody gets a look and nobody gets to know how the device works, not even his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the restaurant is ransacked and he goes missing, the only person willing to take his disappearance seriously is Jeremiah Spur. The retired Texas Ranger and rancher is a dedicated customer, if not a friend, which makes him the only man on whom the Bradshaws can pin their hopes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Hime&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Where Armadillos Go to Die&lt;/i&gt; eloquently captures the voice and spirit of a small Texas town with troubles every bit as big as the whole state, making for some of the most engaging crime fiction on bookshelves today.&lt;/p&gt;" />
