      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Loyal readers of Arnaldur Indridason&#39;s Erlendur series will be thrilled by &lt;i&gt;Into Oblivion, &lt;/i&gt;the mesmerizing follow-up to the gritty prequel &lt;i&gt;Reykjavik Nights&lt;/i&gt;. Here devoted fans will get another glimpse of Erlendur in his early days as a young, budding detective, while also absorbing plenty about Iceland and what makes the place tick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s 1979. A woman swims in a remote, milky-blue lagoon. Steam rises from the water and as it clears, a body is revealed in the ghostly light. Miles away, a vast aircraft hangar rises behind the perimeter fence of the US military base. A sickening thud is heard as a man&#39;s body falls from a high platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many years before, a schoolgirl went missing, and the world has forgotten her. But Erlendur has not. Erlendur is a newly promoted detective, and he is contending with a battered dead body, a rogue CIA operative, and America&#39;s troublesome presence in Iceland. In his spare time he investigates a cold case. He is only starting out, but he is already deeply involved in his work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The writer whose work &lt;i&gt;The New York Times&lt;/i&gt; describes as &quot;having the sweep and consequence of epic storytelling,&quot; has outdone himself in this multi-layered and masterful novel of suspense.&lt;/p&gt;" />
