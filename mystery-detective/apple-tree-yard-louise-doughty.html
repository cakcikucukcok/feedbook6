  <title>Apple Tree Yard - Louise Doughty</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Soon To Be a STARZ Mini-Series, Starring Emily Watson &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yvonne Carmichael sits in the witness box. The charge is murder. Before all of this, she was happily married, a successful scientist, a mother of two. Now she is a suspect, squirming under florescent lights and the penetrating gaze of the alleged accomplice who is sitting across from her, watching: a man who is also her lover. As Yvonne faces hostile questioning, she must piece together the story of her affair with this unnamed figure who has charmed and haunted her. It is a tale of sexual intrigue and ruthless urges--and of danger, which has blindsided her from a seemingly innocuous angle. Here, in the courtroom, everything hinges on one night in a dark alley called Apple Tree Yard.&lt;br&gt;     Shot through with suspense and masterfully paced, Louise Doughty&#39;s novel is &quot;a must read . . . if you liked &lt;i&gt;The Silent Wife&lt;/i&gt;, you&#39;ll fall hard for &lt;i&gt;Apple Tree Yard&lt;/i&gt;&quot; (AARP).&lt;/p&gt;" />
