  <title>Broken Wing - Thomas Lakeman</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Mike Yeager, an FBI agent with a gift for profiling, is no angel, yet somehow the Bureau has always found a way to forgive him his mistakes. Now, even though he&#39;s in disgrace, there&#39;s a job that only he can do. In New Orleans in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, a couple was kidnapped; the husband---a spy---was tortured and killed, and now the wife is in danger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Normally the Bureau might ask Yeager to lead a rescue mission, but this time, they want him to pose as a fallen agent---a broken wing---infiltrate the group responsible, and wait to see what he can learn. The kidnappers are thought to be working for Emelio Barca, one of the most powerful crime bosses in New Orleans, and the target of Mike&#39;s past botched case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike sees this opportunity as his last chance, even though it&#39;s bound to wreck his renewed relationship with fellow agent Peggy Weaver, maybe for good. He&#39;s gone undercover once before in his career, and that time his mistakes led to Barca&#39;s escape and the maiming of Mike&#39;s first partner. This time he vows Barca won&#39;t get away. One way or another, Yeager&#39;s career will come full circle in the Big Easy, the city where it all began.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Broken Wing&lt;/i&gt; is a breathtaking page-turner from a writer who seems to have mastered the genre in only three novels.&lt;/p&gt;" />
