  <title>Dead Right - Bert Wagner</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;I&gt;The heart monitor alarm suddenly screamed as the patient&#39;s EKG pattern abruptly changed to ventricular fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;
&quot;Code Blue!&quot; Dr. Singh screamed, &quot;Get the crash cart in here, now!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
THUMP! The convulsive thrash of his patient after each defibrillation attempt was beginning to be too much for Dr. Brady. THUMP! He didn&#39;t know if he could stand the helpless feeling any longer. Attempt after attempt failed to resuscitate Mrs. Winter. He wanted to scream or run away, but continued in his efforts to save his patient. He prayed he was just going to wake up from this nightmare, hug his wife, and be thankful that this surrealistic scene didn&#39;t exist.&lt;/p&gt;
But that simply wasn&#39;t going to happen. What began as sixty seconds of shock and terror, soon became forty minutes of futility. After trying everything they could think of to restore a normal heart rhythm to the patient&#39;s lifeless body, Dr. Singh called off the code.&lt;/p&gt;
Jessie Winter was dead!&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This action-packed mystery will take you from the operating room to the courtroom as Dr. Brady searches for the truth behind his patient&#39;s unexpected death, and the resulting malpractice and manslaughter trials.&lt;/p&gt;" />
