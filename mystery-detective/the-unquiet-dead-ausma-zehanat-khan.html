  <title>The Unquiet Dead - Ausma Zehanat Khan</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&quot;Khan is a refreshing original, and &lt;i&gt;The Unquiet Dead&lt;/i&gt; blazes what one hopes will be a new path guided by the author&#39;s keen understanding of the intersection of faith and core Muslim values, complex human nature and evil done by seemingly ordinary people. It is these qualities that make this a debut to remember and one that even those who eschew the [mystery] genre will devour in one breathtaking sitting.&quot; --&lt;i&gt;The LA Times&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite their many differences, Detective Rachel Getty trusts her boss, Esa Khattak, implicitly. But she&#39;s still uneasy at Khattak&#39;s tight-lipped secrecy when he asks her to look into Christopher Drayton&#39;s death. Drayton&#39;s apparently accidental fall from a cliff doesn&#39;t seem to warrant a police investigation, particularly not from Rachel and Khattak&#39;s team, which handles minority-sensitive cases. But when she learns that Drayton may have been living under an assumed name, Rachel begins to understand why Khattak is tip-toeing around this case. It soon comes to light that Drayton may have been a war criminal with ties to the Srebrenica massacre of 1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that&#39;s true, any number of people might have had reason to help Drayton to his death, and a murder investigation could have far-reaching ripples throughout the community. But as Rachel and Khattak dig deeper into the life and death of Christopher Drayton, every question seems to lead only to more questions, with no easy answers. Had the specters of Srebrenica returned to haunt Drayton at the end, or had he been keeping secrets of an entirely different nature? Or, after all, did a man just fall to his death from the Bluffs?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her spellbinding debut, Ausma Zehanat Khan has written a complex and provocative story of loss, redemption, and the cost of justice that will linger with readers long after turning the final page.&lt;/p&gt;" />
