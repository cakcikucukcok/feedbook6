  <title>Slip Cue - Joyce Krieg</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Caller One: &quot;She was just the sweetest thing... there&#39;s no way she could have done all those horrible things you media people keep saying she did. Just no way.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Caller Two:&quot;Who&#39;s to say someone else didn&#39;t kill that Johnny Venture? Jasmine could have just been in the wrong place at the wrong time. How do we know for sure?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Caller Three: &quot;If she really didn&#39;t do it, why break out of jail? Why not wait for the verdict and walk away a free woman?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are some of the comments--not really unexpected--that Shauna J. Bogart is getting on her talk radio show after the news that a television and radio star known as Jasmine has escaped from custody. After a long career as an entertainer, Jasmine has been making an amazing comeback, but now she&#39;s just been jailed. Well, someone who wakes up and finds a dead body beside her in her hotel bed can&#39;t really complain about that. The news now is that as Jasmine and four other women prisoners are being transferred to a different jail, the police van is intercepted on the road and the women freed. Since the nationally famous Jasmine was a local girl, Shauna J&#39;s callers, all of whom claim to have known her, are quick (and thrilled) to comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shauna J. is thrilled, too. Anyone who works in the news business, she tells us, will admit to the same, if they&#39;re honest. Add to that the notice she&#39;s just received that tells her she&#39;s been voted into the Broadcast Legends Hall of Fame. With her lover Peter off on some annoyingly mysterious mission, Shauna decides to follow her dream - she will find Jasmine herself, and get a firsthand interview. Shauna&#39;s convinced she can get it; she&#39;s got something other news people don&#39;t have. The song, &quot;Meet Me at the Casbah,&quot; is what has sparked Jasmine&#39;s second round of fame, and Shauna&#39;s own mother had coached Jasmine in that song, many years ago. That, the identity of the dead man, and a scam connected with the song itself all begins to come obligingly together. But the tighter the strands are tied, the more Shauna herself is in real jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As in her first, award-winning book, Joyce Krieg has the delightful Shauna take you behind the scenes of the broadcast world and beyond, spiced by the call-ins of Shauna J.&#39;s listeners and decorated with bona fide pictures of what goes on &quot;backstage&quot; in local radio, in &lt;i&gt;Slip Cue&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;" />
