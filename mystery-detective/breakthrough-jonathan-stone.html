  <title>Breakthrough - Jonathan Stone</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&lt;p&gt;Detective Julian Palmer is taking a break from homicide-or so she thinks. Signing on to assist in a simple insurance investigation, she soon finds herself enmeshed in something far more elaborate. It&#39;s a bizarre case, one that leads her from a dead investment banker with a mysterious briefcase, to a renegade inventor in the New Mexico desert, and ultimately, to the investing frenzy of Wall Street in the late 1990&#39;s. It also leads her to an unexpected romance with Tom Hartley-a man as lonely as Julian, and as passionate about uncovering the truth.&lt;br&gt;Welcome to the twists, turns and switchbacks that are Jonathan Stone&#39;s trademark. A world of puzzles and mirrors, where the possibilities move as fast as the characters. Where the trail goes from cold to warm to searing hot. And where a beautiful young banker seems to wield more power dead than alive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Jonathan Stone&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Breakthrough&lt;/i&gt;, the collars may be white, but the blood still runs red.&lt;/p&gt;" />
