  <title>The Mystery of the Sycamore - Carolyn Wells</title>
      <meta name="description" content="&amp;quot;The Mystery of the Sycamore&amp;quot; is an early type of detective story, falling somewhere between Conan Doyle&amp;#39;s genius Sherlock Holmes and Hammett&amp;#39;s tough-guy Sam Spade. It contains elements of the Gothic (the tale of the phantom bugler, which is used by the murderer as a cover) and the Golden Age puzzle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Dan Wheeler has been condemned to live his life outside of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, as a result of his conviction for forgery, a condition imposed by the former governor of the state, Sam Appleby. Appleby has ambitions for his son to follow in his footsteps, but knows that without Wheeler&amp;#39;s support, Appleby junior hasn&amp;#39;t much hope. So he hopes to coerce Wheeler&amp;#39;s support by holding out the carrot of a full pardon, which would not only allow his wife to keep her inheritance (which comes with the stipulation that she live in Massachusetts--their house is built on the border between Massachusetts and Connecticut) but free his daughter Maida to wed her beloved Jeffrey Allen, a lawyer in Boston. But Wheeler is a man of principle and refuses. Appleby has more tricks up his sleeve, however, and works his plan on Maida. He ends up shot dead in Wheeler&amp;#39;s study, and all three Wheelers confess to the deed." />
